This is SO out of date that half of the information is irrelevant,1
You guys are just trying to sell your book.,1
"I cannot take the quizzes, because of money. The other courses let us take the quizzes without paying money. I dislike you paying policy. Please, let us take the tests without money payment.Sincerely,Garik",1
Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.,1
"Positive: Very interesting and informative lectures and subject matter.Negative: Fellow ""students"" who have no knowledge of the subject (other than what they themselves are learning) are required to submit case studies for ""peer review"" by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do. These case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively (for whatever reason), they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been. No instructor assistance is given. Huge turn-off for me and many of my fellow students. I want to withdraw (drop) this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters.",1
"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. It wasn't an Excel class, rather it was a targeted business statistics class with only disjointed lectures and no benefit of textbook to actually help you learn. Lots of errors in the lectures and tests, and little to no support from course staff. Stay away! You won't regret it.",1
The course is very light on substance. There are significantly better courses and books available on the same subject matter. I definitely would not recommend this course.,1
"It's a mix of too much basic and irrelevant tips from different realms: pronounced english (which, in my opinion could be a great course of it's own), public speeking (only the basic of how to deliver which can be sum up to one page) and how to interact with other people (like how to say you are agree or disagree??? I strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos, I'm pretty sure that he knows that 5-years-old-extremly-basic-stuff).As much I like this concept of coursera, ""speak english professionally"" or even ""speak english"" is really a big statement for that course. Actually, from what it seems, the main point of that course is to get the students to purchase the full package of courses that the Georgia Tech Language Institude is offering. If you really like to know a great course that relates to the topic, I strongly advise you to check out the course ""Public Speaking"" by Dr. Matt McGarrity here at coursera. Best of luck.",1
"This is a very old fashion way of looking at development and developers. Where developers are considered resources and minions that need to follow orders. Modern development techniques value developers and allow them to be much more active players. Product Manager is not a MANAGER but a facilitator. This course describes the view that developers are loose canons that need to be managed and that upfront planning and estimation are the right path. I do not agree at all with this view.Should you happen to agree with this view, the Course is well explained and presented well.",1
Only catered to the American healthcare system. This course was not mind numbingly boring as hell,1
"The lectures for this class are incredibly weak. Later lectures by the same professor are reasonable and decently structured. These lectures need to be redone. The quizzes are either out-of-order or expect you to do a lot of research on your own beyond the class notes and topics. The class project is unbelievably simple, and the final metric for the class project includes duplication and one portion of the grade assigned simply if you feel the person you're grading ""tried"".",1
"Unfortunately, this is one the worst paid courses I've taken on Coursera. The material is very brief, the assignments are poorly explained and structured. As with all the other sections in this specialization, there is no feedback for professor or TAs, which is very-very frustrating.",1
Background is not clear and not able to understand lecture,1
Not much Interesting plus low level of difficulty,1
"The videos are too short, without enough information about the topics. You have to read a lot, Actually, this course doesn't look like as others Coursera's courses and I don't recommend it.",1
very basic.,1
not of a worth,1
Too basic content.I have not learned anything with this course (installing R and RStudio should not be part of exercises or lectures).I hope R programming course will be better,1
This course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.,1
"I had a very poor experience being graded by peers. Although the Capstone Project Assignment itself is EXCELLENT, the peer grading rubric is not. I was not fairly graded, and I am sure of this 100%.",1
poor design on presentation assignment,1
Too much reuse of old material (assignments as well as lectures).,1
This is a joke right?5 minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effective?!you guys are ridiculous!,1
"It has almost no content and isn't actually useful. I've heard later classes in the series are way tougher, so the ramp up isn't at all good.",1
Professor is not engaging at all. Presentation skills are poor.,1
I do not like the different language. I do not read fast enough to keep up and understand what is bing said. I think we should have a language button to translate to English or any other language that takes cources from Corsera.,1
Frustrating as hell. Too much math and computer coding.,1
"If you want to memorize what year countries started their public broadcast systems, this is the course for you.It only briefly discusses critical paradigm shifts and shows. The course lacks a critical analysis element and the video lectures are unstructured. It would be almost impossible to pick three key points they want you to learn from each video.",1
Abstract when the assignment is related to psychology. Could you give us some not that professional articles?The whole course is not designed in a clear and logic way. Overwhelmed with so many terms without clear explanations.,1
"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses.",1
"Really poor course. Rather than starting from the basics, this course picks random information to work with. Week 1 was information anybody with a computer knows. Week 2 was really good. Week 3 and 4 were completely useless. Rather than starting from the basics they jump into picture manipulation and encoding. Don't take this class if you want to learn about coding.",1
Didn't learn anything new. Too much of chit chat.,1
Waste of money.....,1
The content is essentially a subset of the information available in the free tutorials on Tableau's website. And a pretty small subset with that; the total length of the course is less than most of the MOOCs I have taken have for one week.,1
"While the content of this course is interesting and well-structured, the way it's presented on Coursera has major problems.As it stands, this is not really a Coursera course; it's simply a Coursera wrapper around some links to a third-party website. All of the things that make Coursera valuable - videos with inline quizzes, ability to download content, the exam format, peer assessment - are missing. In fact, having Coursera as a wrapper actually makes it more difficult to use, because additional clicks are required to access any resource, and nothing is accessible offline. If this course is to be offered on Coursera, it needs major rework to take advantage of the platform.This is a real shame, because there is some great content here and obviously a lot of care has been taken to structure it carefully for the original Stanford course. For that reason, recommend using the Stanford web site directly.",1
I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who's paying. The assignments instructions are too vague to understand and there's no example given.,1
The course content is presented in a very good way. It is explained in an understandable way and examples provide a good insight. The final assignment is ambiguously described. This is very frustrating if you invest a lot of time and recognize that all classmates proceeded in a different way.,1
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.,1
There is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice. Its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course. A poor introduction to programming.,1
Not worth 29$ considering you could take away very little from this course.,1
Good overview. Needs to include more hands on development. 1 star because Coursera wont let me take the capstone even after completing all four pre-requisite classes (this one is the fourth).,1
The lecturers have poor vocabulary and pronunciation and the videos are very repetitive. They r repeating the same thing in all the videos.,1
Waste money and time! Do not explain very well!,1
The worst! I don't recommend you to take any course from this institute. It is just wasting time and money.,1
"Course advertised incorrectly. This course is more on the electronics and embedded systems end of IoT, as opposed to a high-level perspective.",1
Too many obvious things.,1
"Superficial treatment of the subject matter. Presentation was awkward and slow, and at times condescending in tone. This whole course is equivalent to a 2 hour seminar on ""How to live more positively"" presented at local community centre. It is not university level learning - instead it seems glib and lacking in substance.",1
"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1
The first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP. That meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.Disappointing after a great first course. Hoping the next will be better.,1
"Course depends too much on multiple third-party sites to be as enlightening as I had hoped. I learned about some great resources, but that's about it.",1
"Content is not well organized, videos are disconnected from one another, explanations are not clear, spreadsheets contain vast information that is not explained anywhere. It is been quite difficult to follow through the course and I bet many students are giving up.",1
Too theorical and bold course,1
The course was not what I wanted,1
I havent been able to use C # in my PC so the course became useless,1
"I didn't like that course because of:-weak explanations of algorithms-almost all assignments I googled, I spent all my time googling these algorithms-when code is submitted and something goes wrong It is not possible to understand what is really happened",1
"Hate this class, I wasted 200 bucks on this crap and now I am stuck taking it...",1
"Money hungry, greedy! Won't let us complete quizzes without paying! Shame!",1
"I'm sorry to say this is a poor course. The audio is bad, the sound editing is bad, the ""videos"" are mainly static slides that sometimes aren't even showing what the audio is talking about. There are no worked examples or annotated slides. As an example, there's no discussion of the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com. The only time that is mentioned is when they touch on plugins, where they say you can't use them if you started with WordPress.com! The additional lectures by guest website designers were the most interesting part, but they were supposed to be after the final project. I just gave up after less than an hour and went and played with WordPress myself. Created a website in 2 days, but with no help from this course.",1
Someone who doesnt pay doesnt really participate in this course,1
The assignment is meaningless. lack of instructions.,1
Too expensive for such a simple course,1
there is no proper documentation.at least there should be some clear instructions for first program,1
"Utterly disappointing. I hoped for a fact-based education on current scientific thinking in nutrition. Instead, this course consists of a couple of people's opinions on eating, without cited evidence, presented in a feel-good documentary-lite format with good camerawork and cute children. This is a high school public service announcement, not a university course; not what I'd expect from Stanford or Coursera.",1
"Nothing much to learn, the videos were rather short. There's no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework. The framework wasn't updated for Swift 3.",1
"The quality of the presentation is very low, and way below the quality in other courses. The assignments are very poorly designed. This is not a subjective personal experience. This is based on discussions with other learners in the forum who have expressed disappointment and frustration.",1
"Hi,I was looking for a good introduction course to food and nutrition and, alas, this is not it.I knew 90% of the things discussed in this course, and I was expecting more, but all I got was very basic advices (""eat less"", ""don't eat crap"", etc.), all with videoclips and music which got annoying really quick.Disappointing.Take care.",1
"Its a hard course, and u may only take the quizzes twice every week.",1
$40 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a GitHub account. The entire course should have been the first week of the following course.,1
"Neither statistics nor R was covered in any meaningful way. At the end of the course, you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loops, but no understanding of the principles. I am a college instructor for Statistics, having graduated from a PhD program - even with that background I could not follow the instructor.The course designer never considered the audience, and never identified the goals of this course. The instructor was lost between teaching R and teaching stats, so in the end he did neither. Worst course I have ever taken, both online and face-to-face.",1
Not very interesting or well-presented.,1
Very Poor Course.Should be removed from Coursera.,1
No good without the missing course and capstone projects,1
"Course does not do a good job actually explaining R or training you on how to properly use it. The lectures go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them, and then the assignments throw complex problems that are very difficult. You spend most of your time Googling to learn it, and I find that I would have learned R better if I just did that to start without this course. Maybe if you aren't new to R and have a programming background, it may not be so bad, but if you are new to R and not an experienced programmer, this is not the class to take to learn it.",1
really bad!,1
well taught but not what I thought it would be.,1
"Submit button wasn't working for assignment, assignment was heavily weighted on mobile app (which was the least pertinent part of the course for me), generally seemed disorganized.",1
"By far to expansive for what you get. Anyway, thanks for the hint about swirl.",1
"The provided material is good, but not good enough to be called a 'course'. It seems more like a 'talk', not a 'course'. I suggest to add more materials, or merge with other courses.",1
No factual tools !,1
"Charging for free content, really?? Go fuck yourselves",1
It is very old technique of teaching,1
assingnments are not grading .so i do not have reason to study something that can't finish,1
"I can't complete the course without passing the graded content, but I can't complete the graded content unless I pay money and upgrade. Not the purpose of thes courses.",1
"The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created. I did learn a bit of high level concepts, but when it comes to coding, the answers is always 'conveniently, my software does this for you'. I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper, and implement them.I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible. I have since started the free Stanford course taught by a co-founder of coursera, and it is MUCH better! I recommend it to anyone!",1
Tree exercise had absolutely no relevant video material. Videos give zero context for why data structures are important or when they are used....Should take a lesson from the Stanford course.,1
"Not what I expected. Though the lecturer quite patronising and the exercises too juvenile. Did not finish the course, so it may have improved after the first few sessions. Thank you.",1
when you finish the course you won't be able to print out your certificate so don't even waste your time with this bs website. I am beyond pissed rn and I'm reporting this to everyone this a real comment about this course too.,1
"Poor lectures, inaccurate and incomplete information. Narrative about changing colors is reminiscent of Sal Khan. I just can't listen to any more of this.",1
"Presentation is so boring and dry, I could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of videos.",1
Muy poca información.Very few information.,1
"This course is not so good. A lot of things are just come from the instructor's head without correcting reference from high quality literature. He can say whatever he think is right. But I would not say all animals do not have complex language systems, or we have one single origin of language. I would also suggest the instructor to interview more world-famous linguists, not just play simple ask and answer with his students.The examples of different languages in the later weeks are interesting. But somehow I expect some better understanding of more aspects of languages. In general I would say it still has so much space for improvement. I would not recommend anyone to spend time on learning this course.",1
"I have fallen asleep during 3/4th week, and it have never happened to my during any of the Coursera courses... I'm sorry, but it completely failed my expectations. 3 weeks out of 7 gone, and I have learnt absolutely nothing about dogs. Yes, I got some psychological basis, but that's not what I looked for/ The lecturer politely suggests to buy his book ... well if it is the same quality as the presented course, than it's useless...",1
The entire course was not paced well. The capstone had as much work each week as the other courses had in the entire 6 week course. To make it worse for me the capstone came up at the end of the year when teachers are overloaded already. I ended up having to roll over to the next session 1/2 way through. Work should have been better spread out. I also do not like that you get no real teacher evaluation in a capstone. Meaning a student could take a full 8 courses over a year and then fail when the teachers finally look at all the work in the second capstone.,1
The course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation. I left it because of that.,1
Extremely generic and a but to much of self-promotion.,1
The professor was completely inadequate. Many parts were unsuitable for this course. He has eliminated the useful discussions among students without explanation.,1
All assignments giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased. I did not really feel like a free course .... too,1
Disorganized.,1
"It is too hard to understand what he is saying, his accent is impossible to follow. Besides, the lectures are not dynamic, it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever. I took the first course of the specialization with David and this is the complete opposite. I would love to see the whole 5 courses with David and not only the first one.",1
"I think the way it is taught is not very insightful, the lecturers clearly just read a script and make it difficult to follow. They assignment questions are often hard to understand. Most importantly, there is very little about the actual mechanism behind pricing financial instruments, instead they just state the formula.",1
Extraordinarily dry presentation. It was a struggle to sit through each video.,1
"Waste of time and I did not learn anything from this course.It is basically 6 weeks of the ""facilitator"" asking questions without offering much in the form of answers.",1
"Sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course. The course video provided is quite short, the quiz is rather than nothing and the programming assignments are buggy. I don't feel that I learned a lot from this course.UPenn has let me down twice. Hope the 3rd one will be better.",1
"Sorry, but the course is very poor. I've watched all the videos of the first week and it's mostly about nothing. And, by the way, too much stories. And I'm still wondering why simpke brainstorming is called ZiZoZi (""new"" approach as it described).",1
"Very bad course. No videos, just an interactive textbook. The course states all you need is ""high school level biology"" yet you require coding knowledge for the very first quiz. there are side questions on the first week like does this algorithm runs in O(k * l * x^2) or O(xllogk) without ANY explanation. I guess you can find much much better book about bioinformatics, and as this course is nothing more then a book i recommend a better one.",1
"I was expecting something else, very basic information.",1
Very confused. So there is little point. Only vague news ... nothing substantial!,1
There is insufficient peers to review. The content is mostly theory from the e-textbook.,1
A waste of my time.,1
"Duke.... Coursera... guys, come on! I'd like to contrast this with the Wharton Business Analytics specialization that I'm completing. It was like night and day. I mean, professors in that course are presenting their own research! Cade Massey presents research he did with Dick Thaler! None of that happens here. The information shared doesn't even flow smoothly.This course relies mainly on PDF slides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book). At one point, it even links to 6 articles on another website (and that's in the quiz as well). It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors. The slides themselves seemed scatter-brained, several times asking questions that are never even answered. It was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an ""online"" course. Even the answers to quizzes seemed extremely vague (it often felt like there were several right answers... or none -- to me, this is sloppy quiz writing).I honestly expected better from both Coursera and Duke! The only redeeming part about this course is that behavioral economics is honestly compelling, despite the shortcomings pointed out.",1
"I really wouldn't call this a course, just an overview of VR & AR technologies and really general principle of work for AR. It took be less than an hour to watch everything and pass the tests.",1
Very basic. I guess if you have no education or experience its good.,1
"This course was delivered 6-months behind schedule and the assignments half-way through the course can't even be completed due to technical problems and sloppy content. When students try to seek support to fix the issues, nothing is done and they receive no response. The specialization started so well, but the care that was taken to craft the specialization course content in the beginning has been lost in the later courses.",1
This required nearly no effort and is probably of little value in the real world.,1
"This was really disappointing.There is almost no connection between the experience of the lectures (and that's all the videos are - lectures that track a PowerPoint presentation) and the assignments, quizzes, etc. Reference and source materials are frequently mentioned in passing, but there is no comprehensive list of works cited anywhere. The assignments are often vaguely described and, in more than one case, were described entirely differently in different places.I have nothing good to say about this experience. You're watching a fundamentally disconnected series of mostly ad-hoc discussions of vague concepts. A simple list of books to read would be much more valuable.This is by far the worst MOOC I've taken, from any source, in any discipline. The fact that it actually costs money simply adds to the pain.",1
I can't even access the site.,1
Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $,1
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
Easy but really complicate to submit the assignment.,1
so easy,1
"Not very engaging. Information overflow and poorly delivered lectures where the instructor is just reading from slides. I don't recommend paying for this, it is better to just check out the syllabus and read about this stuff online.Note to instructor: Very simple concepts were explained using overly complicated language. Also, please refrain from over using the word 'essentially'.",1
This course is too short and have little real time example .,1
very general ideas about diplomacy but nothing concrete,1
Way too easy assignments. Only good for people who never did any kind of programming. For the rest it's not worth the money.,1
"The course is very basic, videos contain a lot of repetitions and quiz questions are too easy (in addition, I believe that there are too much negative questions). I believe that this course should be called an Introduction to the basics of Nutrition and it's only for complete newbies. There are no insights in specifics of child nutrition besides general concepts of balanced diet and some tips how to make your kids be more enthusiastic in eating vegetables.",1
"Hi, I am an IT specialist (30 years experience). I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and IoT development, and extend my skills/understanding of the environment. However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool. This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with. Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening. I do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far, and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future.",1
There was basically nothing in it. He only repeated the points in the presentation! No explaining just throwing around numbers.,1
"I soon got bored with the simplistic solutions, lack of challenge, and frankly, a condescending attitude. I then took all the quizzes, guessed or surmised the answers, got 100% right, and went on to something more productive.",1
Peer to peer assignments are really slow and due time dependent.,1
"The Lecturers are very enthusiastic, but I was hoping for examples and assignments based on Pandas and Skikit-Learn. Instead the course examples and assignments are based on a machine learning package called Graphlab, that stopped working when it was upgraded to version 2 (there are workarounds that enable it to work locally, but clearly it isn't ""enterprise ready"")",1
Very little real content or information.,1
"A lot of things (Ruby version controls, PhantomJS installation) from this course don't work on Mac OS X El Capitan.",1
"Totally useless.1) Why is she speaking so so so slow? I put the playback rate at X 1,50 in order to be able to understand her.2) She is just making a summary in bullets of the readings that we are supposed to read anyway. Nothing new in the lectures.If it was not a part of the Specialization I would never follow that course, neither the other one taught by the same professor.",1
The quality of videos is not good. There is some absurd voice in between. Also the course for week 3 has information related to finance which is beyond understanding levels of a person with no financial background.,1
"Tortured by a platform glitch that initially denied me credit for my work and the certificate of completion but would not tell me specifically why. Turns out I needed to submit one additional peer review, although I only found this out by contact customer service. There was never any explicit message telling me what was required to complete the course and the information I did receive through the platform was just plain wrong. Content of the course was good but any feelings of accomplishment were overshadowed by the frustration of trying to straighten out what turned out to be a problem with coursera.",1
"The Instructor doesn't give enough info about principles and her presentation skills are very week,the studying material also are very poor",1
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).,1
no one would take this course any more.,1
"yeah i would give zero if possible. very shallow and general, cannot learn much from it. if u want a course about neuroscience there's way better course than this. what the hell emory? what hte hell coursera? i feel less and less sincerity in coursera's mooc these days. edx is doing a much better job in my perspective.",1
The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization,1
"I quit this course in the 4th week and I hope my following points are seen as constructive and help the owners to improve the experience.- On the plus side this course presents some nice correlations between bible and Babylonion sources.- Quizzes are too hard. If you miss a single piece of information, you can't complete it due to a 4-out-of-8 selection question every week which you HAVE to answer correctly. After reviewing all videos of week 4 twice, I quit.- Lectures often lack a continuous thread to follow. Back and forward jumps in time are common. Timelines at the end sometimes help, but are shown too late.- The forum is abandoned! To the point of time there are three (!) posts in the forum and none of the forum operators. No one is taking care of it.- The lecturer's English is not good, but understandable. Sometimes with unusual choice of words.",1
The presenter are very annoying and i did not learn anything from this...,1
This Course is bad! I try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with I cant help you because of the Honor code. Well tat doesn't sound like much of an honor code to me. Of course I am doing my own work duh! I just need help. Dont we all need help from time to time. I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement. I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring. Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog. I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and If I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board. Do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written. Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on. Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning! Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience. I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding. Make changes and make them now.Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another. Then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem. The menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues. People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own. I just think Coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me. Then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them. People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out. Things need to change with this program. They need to change soon!,1
"I had really high hopes for this course. I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount. I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past. I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course. I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field. As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides. They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.",1
"Short lectures, long intro, ridiculous music. Very quickly decided to learn this elsewhere.",1
starting to like this,1
"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1
"The qiuz are managed terribly, full of error and I seriously doubt the professor ever seen these quiz before. The Course suit for a beginner but a bit fragile, I expect more about building a usable model. This course need serious review.",1
"I do appreciate the effort put into this course, but as a programming course it is not very didactic.It lacks structure and even the names of classes chosen for the examples seem odd.",1
"Learned very little. Doesn't actually teach anything, but gives some tips by talking, the stuff that you can find by using google and clicking on the first link that appears. Some material gets repeated throughout the course. Quizzes are a joke really.",1
waste of time,1
bad course .. teaching was poor... assignments were very high level.. but teachings very of low profile,1
"This was the most poorly designed course that I have ever encountered. Whoever is in control of quality assurance was caught napping on this one - the instructors were woeful! It was as if the principles of instructional design and adult learning were abandoned entirely; there was minimal instruction and I had to rely on my intuition and the assistance of a study buddy to work hard to complete the course. If you are completely new to website design (as I was), prepare for a steep learning curve as you will be spending many hours preparing and organising your info - the title is deceptive and misleading!Ann, Melbourne, Australia April 2016.",1
"The female lecture's speech is so fast and unclear, even though the subject itself is very interesting but I have to leave this class.",1
Boring and not that useful...,1
"While this course presents great content and valuable information, the caveat is in the overall experience. The moderators and instructors are nonexistent and cannot be reached. There is only one moderator who finally did his job and showed up to deal with some issues that many classmates were having (including myself), and even his response time is only once every week! So, he only started checking in once a week after I had already nearly completed the whole course. There are also some serious issues with glitches, technicalities and not being able to pass assignments and grade others' assignments. I completed this course a week ago, and many of my classmates are not able to complete it due to extreme glitches, like the system not taking in their projects and not even allowing them to move forward. It's such a shame. I'm the lucky one in that I was able to finish the course. The others? Not so lucky. They're still stuck back there and the staff of this course is really just not around and doesn't care! It's such a shame because, like I said, the material presented in this course is informative and valuable information.",1
"I didn't like it. It's all theoretical and there isn't any practice.Also, they didn't send me an accomplishment like the other courses that I already done.",1
The content is interesting but the presentation can be improved so that audience will not fall asleep easily.,1
"Very shallow coverage, doesnt have the scope to be an entire Course!",1
Arguments that sound very unconvincing and unscientific.,1
Very boring,1
"Using a proprietary library instead of widely used libraries and discouraging the use of open source widely used libraries. It barely compiles, the example notebook has method calls that use non existing methods of the SFrame object.The course claims that it teaches the student how useful practical knowledge but then ends up using a non standard library and saying not to use pandas or scikit learn.",1
"Course 1 was really enriching, but this second stage didn't achieve the level that it's supposed, videos should be remake in order to connect with learners, materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations.",1
"Capstone exercises were very ambiguous, the students were left to interpret they way they had to finish and how they rated their peers.The peer reviews were poor with little to no feedback and the focus was on how the material was laid out vs what the content was.I have done other coursers and capstones in Coursera this was one of the poorest. UIUC has to revamp this. More guidance to students in the instructions would be the first step.",1
WoW awful presentation but great instructor. I expected much more than this but :(Leveraging employer brand is not compelete :\,1
"I feel that this course is not looked after. Teachers are not actively present. There was an error on one quiz and another assignment was very poorly explained, leading to many feeling like we lost marks due to not knowing exactly what was expected of us. Many of the lessons waste time gushing over what's coming next, but quite often the lesson itself feels weak and vague. At some points I struggled to understand the point the lessons were trying to make. I learned a few interesting things, but for the most part I'm extremely disappointed with this course.",1
"not good as usual one, the code you provided can not work, I had to debug againand the instructions for the assignments are not concrete as the last two courses",1
"The worst professor in this specialization. The subject really interesting, and I have been studying for a while in my Master's and PhD in engineering, so I could understand the bulk of the course. This is a very important subject in data analysis and these poor explained classes could make lot of people give up the specialization. Statistics involves much of mathematics and calculus which make it a natural challenge for most of the people. Please, improve these classes in order not to disappoint the student who want to become data scientists.",1
Still canny program. 0/10,1
bad for the projects,1
"Coursera stands for its rich courses. This one is an exception, one of the worst I've ever seen so far. It's like reading a bad inspirational book. No system, no methods in place.",1
"Some of this content is glaringly wrong e.g that F Roosevelt's freedoms weren't seen by him as inalienable rights, that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor's approach to freedom that were distinctive from FDR. One can go on and on ....",1
"Redundant, poor explanations and a complete lack of examples about the general concepts and the foundations of this discipline. The interaction between the teacher and the slides is limited to a reading exercise that does not provide any add value at all. Very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention -and extremely limited time- or not. Plenty of room for improvement.",1
"just some basic knowledge, most of the knowledge is not expanded or deep introduced.",1
"The most terrible course I have ever seen in my life and on this site. For some of quiz questions, you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes. I really wanted to learn java on coursera but It seems impossible to me. Focusing on rbg values and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quizzes after watching all those lectures are the main reasons of giving 1 star.",1
"Good if you want to fall asleep. The content is probably interesting, but they would have some use of advice from the entertaining industry.",1
"Course lacks wider and real socio-political context of the XIX and XX century Central and Eastern Europe. Additionally, it is full of statements that are not supported by the historical facts.",1
Has been postponed for months and it's still only available for preview,1
A couple of results in Q1 directly contradict the theory. Course is quite unreliable.,1
Coursera and this course sucks. You are at the mercy of idiots doing your peer review.,1
"the tutorials is not for average students, it takes a very high skill to understand them . also the quiz nd the assignments r too tough.hope you can make them a bit easy, the last one ,ie with graphs and trees was a bouncer. If the maths required is so high, please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course",1
"My experience with Teradata has been awful. Connection issues, latency, time outs. What should have taken 45 minutes took nearly two hours because of the load times for datasets. No clock or indication of progression for the queries.",1
"You need to pay to participate in the quizzes. Stay clear, there are free alternatives out there",1
Poor help with instructions. Was trying to install to Linux while reading the video screen as there is little documentation or any actual explanation as to what you're doing. Got to a part where a command on my terminal wouldn't work and given I have no idea how it works to begin with I couldn't debug the issue.Also as a general review of the little of the course I did it's generally considered poor form to just read back what the viewer can see on the screen already when doing presentations. Was disappointed with this course.,1
Good for someone who has no idea of anything about calculus,1
The obstacle of not knowing French is quite detrimental,1
make the other courses free,1
Not that interesting.Many buzz words little knowledge,1
"A total waste of time -- not challenging at all in any aspect. It was quite funny that many word problems were identical with only some parameters changing :) Buckeyes... please, try harder next time :)",1
"The quality of the lectures and teaching was the lowest i have ever seen on Coursera. I wanted to do the whole specialty, but after this first one i was so disappointed that i will stop. The assignments were overly complicated and demanding for no real reason. I have used Coursera for years and this is the first time I have wanted a refund.",1
"I am very disappointed in this specilization/course. I am working as a business analyst in a data warehouse consulting firm, so I was highly motivated to take all the courses! However, lecturer's poor delivery has taked me aback! It is really hard to grasp the information when it has simply been read to you! The lecturer is always reading and it makes me sick (sorry!). Anyway, I would not continue with the courses if nothing changed. In my opinion, if the lecturer respects students and his field of study, he does not READ from the script and lack motivation...",1
I dislike whole specialization.Because videos are waste of time. They are teaching little things with long videos. Also I don't easily understand the accent of the speaker.,1
It would be nice to see more detailed explanation instead of reading the lines in slides. Also there is less practical content for real time usage,1
This course must be a part of another courseres.,1
This is just blatant propaganda for the EU. It's like a big commercial. I'm surprised that Coursera allows this tripe on their website. Awful!,1
"Much more emphasis on statistical analysis than on experimental design. Seems out of place with the rest of the specialization in terms of both length and subject matter. Course assessments seem to test in-depth knowledge of coding in R (which isn't gone over in sufficient detail in lectures, rather students are told to look it up in more detail on their own; however, the class is already longer and more in-depth than all the others in the specialization!) more so than experimental design or statistics. Should be less detailed, or split into multiple courses, or at least should have an introductory lesson(s) or prerequisite course on basics of how R works - I found it extremely frustrating trying to learn about and conduct statistical analyses in a system of which I had only minimal working knowledge.",1
"Don't take this course unless you have a programming background. Week 2 has a programming assignment that is way to advanced for students without any programming knowledge. This assignment deals with functions, where the code is complicated. What's unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment, including this impossible assignment (for beginners) to get recognition for the course. I spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures, and the supplemental information given on a different site, by the instructor (which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient) give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but. This course needs some serious adjustments, either with the prerequisites needed for success in this course, or with the material within the assignments themselves.",1
Quality and length of material is mediocre.,1
"As an educator myself, I found this class to be rather pathetic in its structure and the assignments. These are topics and activities that I was doing as a student in middle school and junior high (both public schools mind you, not arts centered charters). Charging people for a certificate in this ""class"" is tantamount to what diploma mills do as the course requirements are not up to even senior high school level coursework. Truly, Coursera, what happened to your open education offering real education?",1
I was expecting much more from a Stanford or Coursera course. Lack of scientific evidence .Processed foods have become an easy villain among many people and the idea that processed foods are dangerous to our health and the responsible for all our problems is a mistake. Very disappointing.,1
If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you. The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable. Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions. Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer.I'm very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R.,1
"Unfortunately the course is not very well thought out. The lecture videos are poorly organized, concepts are not presented in the proper context and lack sufficient detail/depth, little thought or effort was put into designing the examples in the videos, there are no actual coding exercises until the last week, there are no examples of elegant code, nor thoughtful examples of good vs. bad code, the quizzes contain questions that are poorly worded and ambiguous (and I think some actually have the wrong answers and are contradicted by other online resources). It's very high level, and they hand-wave important concepts. I really don't see how this class can actually teach you to build a robust high-quality app. You're probably better off just reading some of the official documentation online.",1
"The subject matter for this course is very, very interesting! The professor does a nice job of layering the complexity from basic concepts to more advanced concepts. However, this is where the ""good news"" ends. The course is full of all sorts of calculation errors on the graded quizes",1
I think that is a poor course; a lot of much theory and little practice; is better read a book and see youtube. It doesn't meet my expectations.,1
"Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help . No response from peers or moderators on my queries. Had high hopes when I joined the course. I feel cheated now. Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time.",1
Badly formulated alternatives in the multiple choice test,1
"If you have any experience with websites, this course is not for you: it is merely about the soft stuff. Got a couple of nice links to color scheme generator et cetera, but did not deliver what I thought it promised.",1
"I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn't always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted.For a non-specialist, statistics is almost always a struggle, intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math.I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough. I hate being a quitter, but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self-doubt because I just couldn't match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course.Maybe other people are much smarter than I am, but this source was a soul and time killer for me.",1
"Really wanted to take this class. Unfortunately, I believe it is more about advanced statistics then excel. It was advertised as a beginners class and that is not the case. I recommend having a significant knowledge of statistics before taking this course. I'm a 15 year senior level accounting executive and I was easily spending 10 to 15 hours a week plus watching the videos 3 or 4 times each in order to understand the content. It was very difficult to understand. Disappointing.",1
the coarse needs a lot of improvement for the explaining way and the data offered way,1
This class setting is interesting. You cannot participate in assignments and quizzes unless pay for certificate.,1
Cannot understand the diction..,1
"Quite useless. I didnt feel that I learned anything at all. Assingments seem to be dessinged by someone very lazy. The limitations of the assingments do not allow the students to practice what its been tought, but it is asked in the peer assingment from the students to evaluate it!. I understand that when calling it ""Introduction"", it is supposed to be aimed for people totally starting from 0. But still, I cant see how this course is of any use. It is short and does not cover anything. I am very surpirsed that getting the certificate for this course costs the same (in $) than getting the certificate of the Introduction to Principles of Game Design. Principles of Game Design has more than double hours of classes and in the assingments you actually create a game and practice new stuff. This course was very dissappointing.",1
"Joined this course as I was really interested in understanding meditation itself from a scientific perspective. The monotonous drone of the instructors combined with the super low volume that one has to strain to hear, the extra extra long essays which read like one long chapter less novel, the videos which extend what could've been covered in 5-7 minutes to nearly 30, all take the interest away. Unclear if this was intentional & intended to enable participating students to be more patient and tolerant of imperfections around them.",1
I am very disappointed about the content. It is not a course. Pr David Germano is just reading text. No design no learning experience. I would learn much better with just reading a book. It is a shame I was very interested in the subject.,1
"Thanks for creating short course for busy business pearson.But, it is too gamificate to (professional business managers) educate. In addition, this is the lack of contents.For improvement this course, I strongly recommend you to add create presentation and peer review assignments. This is the issue of the Coursera( included other MOOCs) Open Access Education philosophy.",1
"It was painful to work through the videos at first place, for more than one reasons. Very linmited (I would say insufficient) and inconsistent use of background data (diagrams, equations, symbols,pointers) on the board to support what was been talked about. It felt like a plain reading of mathematical expressions and descriptions. As a consequence I had to completely rely on the www to learn the topics covered so I could do the exercises. If that is how the standard of tutoring is to unfold for UoL Global MBA program (to which this is a foundation), I would seriously reconsider my decision to go for. I have been into a MOOC UCL and regret to say this course (Quantitative Foundations for International Business) is a big disappointment. Hope someone listens and th",1
"Content is very basic. I believe this can be useful for school graduates, but if you have at least a couple years of hands-on experience, you shouldn't find anything new.",1
The test questions are abysmal.,1
"Poor content, only a book accompanies the videos and we should not be forced to buy anything!",1
What are you talking about?,1
"I'm dropping this course because it's just SO poorly conceived. Three weeks in, and I can't really articulate what I've actually learned (which leads me to believe that the answer is ""not very much""). The major problem is that this course has no clear objective. And I don't mean that the individual lessons don't have objectives - I actually mean that the entire course doesn't know what it wants to be and the instructors seem to have bypassed this critical question. I have a background in Python, and I was under the impression that this course would teach me how to program in Swift (seems like a fairly straightforward goal). But it isn't that at all. If I were to summarize this course (perhaps a little uncharitably, because I'm annoyed at the time I wasted) it would be: some dudes with a computer talk about some cool features of a programming language. I'm fairly baffled by the fact that there was no thought put into which examples might best illustrate the features they were trying to teach. Which-examples-might-best-illustrate-the-feature-I-am-trying-to-teach is pedagogy 101. They would regularly work through examples just to conclude ""actually that's a bad example"". This is pretty strong evidence that there was no lesson planning involved. There were also no practice exercises, no posting of pieces of illustrative code, and hence, no way to actually get good at programming in Swift (unless it's self directed, in which case - why bother with the formality of taking a course on Coursera?).",1
"Frankly speaking, it should be the most disappointing MOOC I have ever enrolled so far. The Professor's teaching is clear and comprehensible but the depth of the course content cannot meet the university level, especially from a worldwide renowned school like Wharton. Quiz is the most terrible part which seems like nobody could get it because of the ambiguous questions and paranoid answer area. Personally, I, like many other mates, am really grateful to Coursera for offering everyone this equal opportunity. But courses with that kind of quality but staggering price will destroy the company's brand. We all want Coursera to go further and better, but few people prefer monopoly businessman rather than prestigious professors and diligent intellectuals.",1
"The course is poor. Exams are too easy, video lessons are boring and not engaging. Content is poor too. Did not like the course.",1
"It's unbelievable is how many way you can rephrase the same idea over and over again, without making any progress in something new.",1
This g,1
One could learn as much from any of many texts. This course does not add value,1
"So much of the content was limited without paying for the course, that calling it a MOOC is a real stretch. Because of these limitations, most of my work was done on my own, and by purchasing the related book. Since my local Community College used to run this course, but now points to this onine course instead, it's a huge disappointment. Most folks who are going into business for themselves need good information but have little cash. The one star is for the handouts (I believe pulled from other websites but pointed to by this course) - these have been useful.",1
I am trying from last 5 days to start my enrolled course but error message is displaying Everytime. Kindly solve my problem.,1
"There needs to be more help available, at least for paying students, to answer questions and clear misunderstanding. The quizzes are taking too much time.",1
extremely boring teachers,1
Very basic and trivial information that can be easily summarized in an article. Not need for a whole course.,1
Not very useful.,1
"If what you want is the sort of doctrinaire overview of fine-art photography that you might have learned in a university in the 1970s, this is exactly the course for you!It's thoroughly saturated with the Museum of Modern Art mindset: the assumptions and interpretations are those touted by MoMA curators, and the photographers are chosen from the MoMA-approved pantheon. (The quiz questions tend to focus on course-content minutiae -- ""Which commentator said X about Y?"" -- to make sure you've drunk your art-establishment Kool-Aid.)On the other hand, if you want to examine the diversity of photography through a variety of critical approaches -- Marxist, feminist, queer-theory, post-structural, whatever -- well, they don't allow none of that there here. This is strictly the Photography Gospel According to MoMA, and you either like it or lump it.",1
"I was terribly disappointed in this course. Mr. Onuf spends the majority of these lectures implying what Jefferson thinks without discussing much in the way of actual history. Further, the course seems more of a commercial for the University of Virginia than anything else. Overall, a waste of time.",1
The female presenter's speed of speech is so slow it's almost hard to concentrate on.The questions where answers need to be filled in are so stupid that you can fill in any random letters or punctuations and it'll count as pass.Like the comics!,1
"Started in middle of everything, its course covers 5 to 7 factor samples, in the final exam the minimum factors is 70 or more!You not will learn R, not really business insights, but you learn some specific cases.I think you will learn lots of betters course in this site.",1
Only part 3 was partly interesting and usefull. All the rest is vain.,1
did not learn anything useful at all.,1
"I was disappointed in the lack of explanation for the tools. Since everything depends on the IDE, and there was no instruction about the IDE, I found it difficult to do the labs. In the course of trying to, the IDE somehow managed to corrupt my hard drive. After that I pretty much lost interest in the course.",1
"This course is the least content rich of the series, so far. Seemed basic to me, but maybe that's because my background is communication and content strategy.",1
It was too slow,1
"Seems like the quality of this specialization goes down with every course. The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course.I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework.",1
Last exercise is half the course and took many frustrating hours to install and for me never worked. No support provided by instructors. You are on your own.,1
"Content covered in this course was hard to learn, both because it was pitched at a level that realistically was more akin to a wrap up of content already covered (when in fact it was all new content) and because the instructor, Brian Caffo, has not a style that was conducive to teaching.The instructor often would launch into a topic, and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanation.In terms of time, this was one of the most intensive courses in the specialisation, and I'd recommend taking this course alone (not concurrently with other courses) for that very reason.",1
"Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be. Where is the discussion board? How can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates? Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight. In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair. I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion! Also, in the ""check all that apply"" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong. Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course. One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks. Something needs to be adjusted.",1
This course is not organised so well concerning grading process.....there is a lot of mistakes in the criteria of grading ....also the material is not so good ....I learn nothing new ...... the worst course i took in coursera Actually so no stars goes to this course,1
"I've taken several statistics, data science, and R courses. This is one of the worst. I took others' advice, and I also strongly suggest looking to other sources to learn Statistical Inference before taking this course. Khan Academy, DataCamp, Udacity, Duke (Coursera), and Columbia (edX) all have great courses. Though they vary in depth, each leaves you with a good understanding of the concepts they teach.",1
Professor just re-iterated text and readings. Lectures were poor and provided no insights,1
"Very cursory and doesn't get into analysis about why things are the way they are. This course just explains who the actors, their roles and environment they operate in. It would have been much more interesting and useful to learn the why.",1
Very Limited material.,1
"Slow videos repeating several times the same thing (not a pedagogical / ""good to fix an idea"" kind of repetition), which makes them hard to follow.However the worst are the exercises: the first time after 3-4 other Coursera Scala related courses where I have to actively check the forums for minute details about what is expected / implied for the solutions to pass the grading.Things like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicates, subtle differences between average and mean, etc. ...In all other courses the expectation of the exercises were sufficiently clear and straight forward that I never had to check the forums to solve them.Also, the code style of the exercises is literally an anti-pattern in idiomatic Scala, against everything learnt in the previous Scala courses: ""var"" all over the place, low level loops like in C or Java, etc. ...",1
"I was looking for a course for a basic learner, this is not. I feel it very complicate and not friendly for a person with 0% guitar skills.",1
"When the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledge.There is minimal actual instruction in excel-most often concepts are taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard. Nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course. I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs. The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.",1
No practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics. Too complex all the course,1
Very poor explanations.,1
"No relevance to specialisation. Do not expect to get through this if you have not taken multiple statistics courses at university level or higher maths. Barely any practical application, does not prepare you for final project.",1
Unprecedented high speaking speed.,1
"Course is a little formulaic, had trouble making my submissions follow the structure outlined but still, I learnt some useful tips and actually got to just write something orderly.Liked some of the visiting speakers (the third speaker who talked about character - mature lady, dark hair) was quite good. So was the first gentleman.Overall, the course is ok but given the strict methodology and requirements for writing, I don't know if I'll make it through the specialisation.Thank you for reading!",1
Not well presented at all. Great disappointment.,1
"Puerile, made up examples with made up data, no deeper treatment of the mathematics involved than the here-is-a-magic-formula-use-it approach and mistakes (including serious conceptual and factual errors) evident in the quizzes and the R labs. Far better to look out for the ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" course by Duke on Coursera that is presented by a passionate statistics teacher, covers the same material (and more) and provides a far better introduction to R than this course.One of the stated purposes of this specialization is to clean up the way social scientists conduct science and are perceived as scientists; in this respect, it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists.",1
"I only received 96% as a final result, even though I obtained 100% for every assignment. Pathetic rating system. If I had paid for this course I would be incensed.",1
Only fit for absolute morons and perfect ignorants. No content value whatsoever. I don't understand why Coursera allowed this one to happen to be on the Coursera website.,1
"My course 3/4 in this specialization is still incomplete because the questions had wrong answers in the module quizzes and it was literally taking HOURS to complete the quizzes because you had to guess which one of the wrong answers would be correct this time. The questions rotate through slightly different questions each attempt so you can't simply use elimination on each attempt, YOU GUESS EVERY SINGLE TIME. IT'S LITERALLY 100% LUCK! I thought maybe course 4/4 would be better but nope, same problems here. I've wasted over 6 hours in total trying to pass these broken tests and I'm completely over it. I also reached out to chat support, they went through and said they couldn't find anything wrong and couldn't help me and a refund was impossible because it's past the refund date. Even though I paid for 2 broken, un-proofread, time wasting courses. Also, in course 4/4, the math tables in the videos are staggered all over the place and looks terrible. Seriously an issue of someone not even looking at the video before publishing, would have taken less than 5 mins to fix for the entire course. Also, every time a ""checkpoint"" question is supposed to pop up, nothing happens. In every single video, they're all missing. I've used Coursera for a few other courses and thought they were reliable but this makes me think otherwise and I feel like such an idiot for paying $200 for this COMPLETE GARBAGE. Other people in the forums have shown they have the same problem posted over a month ago but nothing. Please, someone from Coursera get a hold of me and help me resolve this ridiculous problem.",1
"I am really unhappy with this course. Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction. The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative, but the assignments are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience. Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete.Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after they're submitted. So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material.I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses. I feel like I wasted $49.",1
"The course provided almost no value , and there was almost nothing covered that you couldn't find online for free. The presentation was probably the worst part of the course: It was extremely boring and made it hard to get through the videos.I didn't expect much practical parts in the course, but there was even less than what I expected: What was described as setting up a hadoop cluster consisted of downloading a preconfigured VM image and running it, and then typing in a couple of commands that were provided to you. Again, nothing of value was added, and quickly going over the FAQ page of any of the products mentioned would be more helpful, faster and a lot more interesting.",1
"A rather non-engaged teacher ho does not know what goes on with the reviews. She does not have enough people to review the written assignment and the assignments go UN-reviewed leading to a 'no-grade' whihc is ridiculous. It is not even clear how the written reviews are graded. She is not involved and does not serve to inspect the work of the students to ascertain that a grade is in order. Three reviews are requited for a grade, but she has so few reviewers that one might only get one review and then fail. Very inept. Stay away from this one. She does not get involved with answering questions of students either. Her internet activity is rated a 2/5 whihc I did not know until I got involved with this course. Observation of the video showing her teaching is terrible. She places herself in front of the camera and one cannot see the placement of the student's fingers or most importantly what is actually happening on the fret board with the finger movement. She also places herself directly in front of the camera blocking a clear view of everything - poor video skills.",1
Painful to watch and boring as hell!,1
Boring course!,1
"I didn't think it was possible to dislike finance more after taking a course designed for non-financial professionals. Clearly, I should have known more about finances before taking this class, and perhaps I would have liked it more. However, I left the course feeling more frustrated than ever.",1
"I should suggest my fellow Coursera students not to waste their money and time for this course. You'll learn a lot more than this course has to offer if you consult some websites with screenwriting tutorial blogs, read books and write on your own.I am a PhD student of theoretical film studies and and a fan of Coursera courses. I was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting hands-on course. Well, it's project-based alright, but where's the real guidance??This is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance. The videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something, that's all. No methods explained other than some terminologies like bible, acts, outline being thrown at you. No examples, no comparisons, no detailed approaches.Lastly, scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course. Being peer-reviewed doesn't help here -- a total novice can not effectively judge another newbie's work nor give them quality feedback.",1
"A disorganized mess. Got no acknowledgement that i was turning in assignments. My peer-review assignment for week 1 was done the first week was never peered, reviewed, or peer-reviewed. Completed three weeks, all assignments exactly as instructed. God only knows if anything has been received or credited. I hate myself for getting suckered into this awful thing. Bye Coursera.",1
Very boring,1
Did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but had it on the first quiz,1
"Good introductory course. However, an overkill as a separate course (and hence charging $30 for it). Courses 1 and 2 could have been clubbed together.",1
"A good instructor and interesting assignments, but the information presented was quite shallow. I don't feel that I learned much from this course.",1
Doesn't effectively explain how to implement the NN,1
"Too much technical. I would have preferred high level generic concepts. Also, the exercises were quite tricky for a beginner.",1
"Superficial coverage of quiz and final exam material in the video lectures. Without getting the textbook and reading it in depth, it is difficult to do well in this class.",1
"Terrible lecture videos with many typos, absence of lecture notes, absence of course staff on a discussion forum. Maybe suitable for those who is alredy a scientist and just need to get some general sence of data science.",1
not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks. hard for a student (even one who has a programming background) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront.The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course. the whole course seems disjointed.would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving.,1
Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer rating stuff which I despise. And there seems to be no way to un-enroll.,1
Trivial course. This 7-week course can be easily completed in an hour.I learned nothing from this course that I did not already know about python.This course is strictly for beginners.,1
"Это не курс, а набор эзотерических, бездоказательных практик, которые способен придумать для себя даже школьник. Учителя Павла Кочкина, о которых сам он с гордостью рассказывает - Норбеков и Лапин. Псевдоученый с псевдостепенями и тантрист. Это Курсера?!This is not a course for Coursera! It's a shame that this kind of non-scientific blabber found its way onto this platform. The techniques Pavel Kochkin is promoting are basic to say the least. His teachers are a known quack and a tantrist. And Pavel himself is proudly telling his story of how he lied his way into a job for which he had no skills. He's giving false definitions to 'personality' and 'intrinsic/extrinsic motivation'. He's confident, he's got presentation and cute animation, but his message is just as quack as his teachers! I am shocked and disgusted. And on top of that there's A LOT of self-advertisement and links to Pavel's online courses.It's a shame MEPhE put its label on this course. It's tragic that Coursera swallowed it as well.",1
The most boring course ever. I just couldn't go beyond the first day,1
This is by far the worse course I'd ever had taken. If you are a beginner I suggest you go look somewhere else. The software installation is hardly explained (the instructor writes a whole bunch of code in the terminal without even explaining correctly what we are writing). I abandonned this course because the instructions were not clear enough.,1
"Professors need to undergo a presentation and Instruction Design skills. They were talking a lot and everything was going over my head, the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples, specifically in the last week.",1
was not as good as previous courses in this specialisation,1
"Coursera changed the rules on access to graded quizzes in the middle of this specialization. The last course in the specialization allowed free access to graded quizzes and homework.During this course, the ""free access"" to quizzes and assignments is no longer an option.Even more annoying is the fact that I also receive email reminding me to ""complete the quiz"", which would require me to upgrade to a paid enrollment to allow me to submit assignments to grading.Thanks for nothing, Coursera!",1
"Course was the worst I have taken on Coursera. I wish I could have received a refund. The professors were hard to follow, laughed through mistakes and did not do a good job of walking through the course content. I would not recommend this course to anyone.",1
Not what I expected,1
Somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that I could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it I had to cheat. I don't feel like I am learning anymore.,1
"Good lectures, but the R-lab is horrible. Do not take this class.",1
"Sorry to say that this is the worst Coursera Course I have ever taken, and I've taken quite a few. The instructors did not do a good job at explaining how to use Wordpress. They didn't explain how to use wordpress to make a website that looked more like a website than a blog. They didn't explain the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org even though they mentioned them both. They talked about hosting but didn't explain how to do it. They mentioned hosting on bluehost but didn't give any instructions. The few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples. They mentioned Jetpack but didn't say what it was. They didn't explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them. And on I could go.The only good part about this course was the last section where they had guest lecturers, some from Coursera - those were all excellent.",1
Terrible...can't believe how a quality the course is. Embarrassing.,1
"I was unhappy with this. It was clear that this course was pulled together from a superset of other material, and that it was not checked for consistency or completeness. The students were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principles learned from utilization of the graph database tools. (Broccoli -- REALLY???)Further, the lack of response to questions posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructors and / or facilitators.",1
Not enough notes.,1
No real applicable knowledge gained,1
not upto the mark.Not meant for intelligent students,1
"Probably the worst class I have ever taken on Coursera. The teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were, what they did, or when and how to use them. There were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion, so that even if you did do things correctly, you would think you were wrong and be confused, and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us, which makes things pretty impossible to learn. If you're more advanced, it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets, but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners.",1
"The lectures are unpolished and hard to follow, especially as the captions are inaccurate. The mathematics in the course are not explained clearly.",1
"A waste of money. Only $50, but it was so terrible I did not even want to finish it. And apparently I waited too long to get a refund as well. Never again.",1
it was halful,1
New format makes it impossible to watch off-line.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads (not teaches) the course, Justin-Nicholas Toytama is horrendous. He's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice.He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class. If this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course. $64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival's Udemy course.",1
"I was not impressed. (And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.) There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use. The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless. The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Enron, Worldcom, Texaco, et al. None of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime.I'm about to become a registered investment advisor. I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations. No go. This was terrible.In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think. They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter. A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the ""teachers"".",1
"The instructor says in the first video: ”you do not need to read a book on how to write a script” – in my opinion YOU DO! Better to read a book or two than waste your time on this course; the videos are extremely short, shallow and a waste of time!",1
"I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities, but this course is clearly biased. The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest. A university is meant to teach the whole story, and have a truthful account of facts. I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals, on the pretext of unbiased learning. This course clearly has an agenda. I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not.",1
Not much teaching going on here. The concepts are barely touched on before the student is asked to jump into training exercises that require lengthy proofs of concepts not thoroughly taught.,1
Too many videos and not cluttered assignment codes,1
"Boring, most of them are history. Don't worth it ! 1 week into the course, very boring. Not technical enough. The test basically asked people to remember things that are not useful !",1
I did not conclude the course because of the fundamentally wrong guidance that this lecturer promotes. Today we know more advanced and useful methodologies for entrepreneurship.,1
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.,1
Incredibly vague and hand wavy. I didn't feel like I had to write anything down.,1
"Assignments are ambiguously phrased and full of inconsistencies and typos. The last assignment does not provide feedback at all. It mainly felt like sitting in a lecture theatre getting a fragmented overview of the lecturer's work, while never gaining a real handle on the wider context, or what would have happened if an action hadn't been taken/had been performed differently. There was not enough further reading and no discussion of other people's work - such as a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wild.Rather than learning how I could tackle any project, I now know how to work on very specific examples of projects - if anything was to deviate from this, I'd still be clueless.Overall, the course feels haphazard and badly prepared.",1
"If you don't want to actually learn what anything means and just get walked through steps on how to do things then take this course. But if you're a beginner to HTML, CSS, and Java Script, this isn't for you. He doesn't actually TEACH you anything, he just takes you through the process. They haven't updated the course content to actually match what is on GitHub's page, so from the start you have to go into the FAQs to figure out where to go from there. It's really frustrating because he will just skip steps, and because he doesn't explain WHY he's doing something, if you miss a step, you get completely lost. I've taken a few coursera courses, and this was the most frustrating course I have taken.",1
"There are too many mistakes and misleading statements made in the course material. There were a lot difficulties with submitting assignments in order to move forward in the course. I had to give up because I don't have time to be bogged down like this.The students' comments and discussion would be useful if they can be accessed from within each lesson. I can't make heads or tails of what the discussions were referring to, when they are all clumped together at the course web site instead.",1
"The teaching process is very elusive and subtle. The explanations in this course are very unclear and tricky, even some of them are omitted, which makes this course very hard to understand.This course seriously lacks of logic. It's more like a heap of formulas thrown together and what the teacher do in this course is just to read them.",1
very low quality and not practical,1
Very disappointing!!!!!!!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....where are the practical applications?lack of examples....it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....would not recommend to a beginner.Period,1
Content needs to be updated,1
"Hello,I've completed 5 modules of the specialization successfully with excellent grades. However, the biggest challenge and disappointment was the capstone. The case given is pertaining exclusively to the North American market. Students enrolling into the course are situated globally which makes it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project. Several hours of extensive research yields no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project. Reading material provided explains mainly the company profile, a few links are blocked due to geographical restrictions, reports that are available are to be purchased etc. While the money invested is not refundable now, however coursera with university team needs to seriously resolve this point. All learning done through the course remains largely a theoretical knowledge if a student isn't able to apply it in his/her job.",1
"As a professional Instructional Designer, I can attest that this is the poorest-designed course I have ever seen. Regrettably, I paid for the entire specialization up-front, and I cannot get a refund or even a Coursera credit for enrolling in a different specialization.Be aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record does not participate in the course. The video lectures are poorly done, including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out, but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it.There is not so much instruction as an overview. There are no coding exercises until the final assignment, which is poorly-described and requires the student to self-teach using outside sources.There are app specializations in Coursera that appear much better-designed. Look elsewhere.",1
"Very knowledgeable educators.Course is given in a q&a style which is very very good for a web based course since the questions often are exactly what i want to ask.However, think the course can still be improved, especially in the following aspects.(1) examples in the course are not thought through ahead. Instead, educators came up with them on the spot. that way it may not be the best example to convey the message, plus the videos are made unnecessarily long in this way. Think it's good that for a programming course to show real time programming sometimes. But to do this all the time is a bit too much and therefore inefficient. Comparing to some other courses, think this one could really benefit if the educators could give some thought on how to teach, especially to think from a student perspective.For example: about the capability of overwriting and defining new operators, the example given was to define a knife operator and to overload plus operator to stew vegetables. Both examples do not make much sense to me. Although i did understand that it's nice that one can define his/her own operation/operator, when the examples came I actually got confused -- how do i stew vegetables with code??(2) Some of the quiz questions I don't find useful. For this course I need lots of time to complete the quiz in contrast to other coursera courses I did. This is because i need to actually read the documentation in order to answer the quiz questions since they are really in depth. In this way, to do the quiz is actually the way to learn. But some questions are quite artificial, for example, there's a multi-choice question about ""what are the different ways one can find help...""(3) Finally, I find the video and the quiz very abstract. that it's very difficult to follow without making a line of code myself... Also it is not clear what the educators expect as a pre-requisite for taking this course. Sometimes things are explained as if the listeners have no programming background at all. some other time, a concept is explained so fast I wonder whether i should have known objective-C in order to follow this course...",1
"Unfortunately, this wasn't what I expected from the course. Maybe since I didn't take specialization but I feel that this course was too theoretical. I understand the history of SEO but I'm not confident how useful it'll be in real-life/commercial sense.",1
"The teacher just read the PowerPoint,and his voice makes my sleepy.",1
Lack of insights and practical information,1
Nothing interesting. Common information about nothing. Sorry,1
"I wanted to learn more about programming, but instead I found myself tested on RGB combinations and building a website straight out of 1998. The course is scatter and although it claims to be for beginners, it covers programming concepts rather quickly. If i hadn't taken other programming classes, I would have been lost.",1
"This course did not make any effort until I had to dig deep into biology by myself. The course content is insufficient. I think if a sample input was used and every field of the input were explained and also the outputs were explained then it would make much more sense. Poorly designed and demonstrated. Thankfully I started the last assignment very quickly, it took me 10 days to understand how to proceed with the assignment. The TA is excellent, without his help I wouldn't pass this course.",1
Where is the material? There is nothing under any of the weeks lectures.,1
"The course is great, but I am very disappointed that after spend 3 hours watching the videos and practicing, I can only submit my answer if I upgrade. This should be said before I enrolled in this course.",1
"Poor course. No original material, they use Tableau training material. I did the first 4 weeks of the course in 5 hours and learned nothing new, except using Tableau. I could have learned the same using the Tableau first video in 10 minutes.",1
I found the jump in difficulty for the first assignment too great. This seems to be a view reflected elsewhere.,1
"1- Almost no content , all just general knowledge2- the instructor was very hard to follow, his intonation is totally off and the sentences are broken so you can't connect the thoughts together.3- There was no forum and thus no interaction.",1
"Very painful training, the contents reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignments, you will have to learn what you need on your own. To me the only value added of this course is that I will receive a proof that I know how to define basic functions in R.",1
"This is a good Java Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBWX97e1E9g&list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19I followed two videos and I'm learning in my way.I left the course because the ammount of time required was too high. For example, for one part of an exercise I spent a total of 12 hours distributed in 3 days. For the other part of the exercise I spent 1 hour. Also, in the part one, the last exercise was tremendouly difficult for begginers and for someone (my case) that know one language.You are making people hate Java. This is not for begginers. I have to say that the part of codepen and HTML was great.Fortunatelly, I didn't pay. But I think that paying for this course is a waste of money. I had a good experience in other Coursera programming course: ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"" of Rice Unviersity. The examples were awesome and the tests were reasonable, quite the opposite to this course.Also, Eclipse is so much better than BlueJ in many ways, also into learning...And there's more things that must be improved, but no time and no money.I'm very dissapointed to this course and Duke Univeristy.",1
"This course is not maintained. It's flat out exploitative to throw students at an AWS assignment without updated instructions and with outdated versions of pig scripts, etc. They're setting students up to hemorrhage money on AWS and possibly not get anything out of it. Under no circumstances should you take this course or even this specialization so long as this assignment is gating it.",1
"Death by power point. If you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages, then this course is for you! If you're like the rest of the population, then these lecture videos are useless. The only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework, but you can find them online or come up with them on your own.",1
79 USD? just to be able to submit peer-graded assignments... talk about greed,1
"I don't recommend this class. Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through. I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues). Questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered. My advice, save your money and don't take this class.",1
The course structure is not thoughtfully prepared. There is a lot of confusion around what the instructor wants to say. The practice quizzes and course content have no match whatsoever,1
This is a very bad course I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as it doesn't concern to any coding.,1
Im not finishing it since in the test are missing a lot of sounds ..............,1
Not very good nor scientific,1
"besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?! somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one)",1
This is a course that sounds like a bad audiobook. The prof. reading a the lecture and giving lot of information without any soul or teaching energy to engage. I prefer then read a book about this topic than being here at this course get bored listening at the same tone a reading of a lecture.,1
"It was not a great course. I found it not very rewarding, because the discussions were hard to follow. Also, it did not present historical literature and research on the subject. I was hoping for peer-reviewed articles and readings that helped illuminate the history and the psychology of education.",1
most of it you can't do unless you pay for it. - not sure I can even click 'complete' for the course. so not really a MOOC. - no option for collaboration.Videos had useful content about 50% of the.Week 4 resources was by far the best and most useful.,1
"My only happiest moment in this whole course is writing this review, I couldn't wait to finish it in order to give it the 1 star rating it deserved.What I've seen from this course so far is abandonment , that's right this course is abandon ware, no questions get answered on the forums (asked a question a month ago and still didn't get an answer) and the links are outdated (links to further documentation don't work).I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Machine learning since the instructors use proprietary libraries that need a license to use outside this course thus application wise what you learn her isn't transferable only the conceptual content;however, even in that there isn't much content for, since everything is an introduction here so nothing is quite useful .If your on a tight budget and your taking this specialization you could skip this course. Actually you could even skip this specialization since they canceled the capstone project so investing any money and time here is a waste. I can only recommend this specialization/course IF the instructors add a project at the end , be more involved on the forums , update non functional links ,and finally USE NON PROPRIETARY libraries hence they will need to take feedback from the students and redo most components of this specialization.",1
"Online grader for labs is terribly buggy. Attempted submitting labs several occasions - all fail. Local builds work fine with apps working as expected and tests pass. The online builder gives very little feedback other than ""BuidError"". £40 wasted. Will not recommend and will never fall for it again. AVOID!",1
"Terrible. Had to verify multiple times. Audio quiz had no sound (struck-thru speaker icon I couldn't fix.)I'd be disappointed with Cousera for foisting this trash if I hadn't taken ""Learning How to Learn,"" much less buggy.Would disenroll if there was any way to do so.",1
"Bad course, a lot of talking but no explainantion. Non of the math is explained. and that is themajurity of the questions that come back in the tests",1
"Not done with the course yet, but I have to say it started out very well and organized. I was actually learning how to use excel in the first week WHILE the instructor was teaching. The later weeks, however, seem to be completely different. They're disorganized and I'm struggling to see how the material correlates. It's as if I'm being bombarded with random topics, in addition to the fact that the instructor literally stops using excel to teach. After week 1, lessons are just random notes on a blackboard with a link at the end to the excel sheet in which the instructor has already prepared before with A LOT of info that you need familiarize yourself with solo. I had high hopes when I was done with the first week, but now I have to say I'm bored and demotivated!! (so far)",1

"This course is supposed to be part of specialization. Unfortunately this is a second course, and the first part doesn't provide necessary information on what we actually do with Galaxy. It felt like following instructions to push certain buttons.I would only recommend it to knowledgeable people with certain background, that should be listed as a REQUIRED knowledge. I hardly learned anything, except for that there is something called Galaxy, we do some analysis by pushing buttons, using preconfigured tools. I don't have expertise to analyse data on my own... unfortunately.As I applied for a financial help here, I won't complain much :).",1
"The articles that were limited were actually somewhat helpful. The google hangouts seemed lackluster and draining.

"While the course is very interesting, I found the peer review process unsatisfying. I did not enjoy grading others without knowing if I was right.

No real-life examples, no practice, just obvious things and pure theory from dawn of dinosaurs. 1 star for Ostervalder's business model canvas, the real mark of this course is 0 stars. Where is the first edition of this course with original lectures of Tom Mierzwa? I feel robbed for 49$.",1
"i can not unenroll this course, it's very terrible",1
The same information was covered in multiple lessons. It was a very conceptual look at cyber conflicts that you could get if you paid attention to the news over the last five years.,1
"Week 1 and 2 were very useful. As a beginner, I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Week 3 was a big leap to JavaScript, and the level of difficulty was the reason why I quit the course. Concepts are not well-explained, a lot of material for completing the tasks is missing. Please make JavaScript part simple for beginners.",1
"what in Stalin's name is ""tail that wags the dog""?",1
Very poor course. Not at all academically rigorous. Just a bunch of common sense statements. Instructor's presentation style borders on condescending.,1
The peer-review rubrics need adjustments.. it's very hard to grade anyone this way. Especially when the answers are just wrong.The staff/teachers/instructors CAN BE A LOT MORE INVOLVED ON THE FORUM!,1
"Why there is no ""minus one"" star? Because one star is way to much for this course. Stay away!",1
"Week one starts with interesting material that relates probability to data science. Unfortunately as the course progress the course material and videos become less and less helpful. Ultimately the student has to visit other web sites and youtube to actual learn the expected material. The course notes are next to useless and the video are equally unhelpful. I am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course. Avoid this course, and head over to KhanAcedemy and complete their probability and statistics program and you will actually learn all the material in this course with a ton of examples and top class videos.",1
It would be better if the instructors cared to respond to queries.,1
This course should really be called BASICS of healthy cooking or for people with unhealthy habits. It is very basic! And very based on the US reality! Living in Europe and used to cooking healthy food for my family everyday I have not learned anything new! Very disappointing to see such a basic course being offered by big names as Stanford University.,1
"- In this course, using python 2.x- The whole course in Chinese, no English subtitles- There are no additional materials or information- There is nothing - only the Chinese",1
"I have no idea why you called it course, since there was nothing inside.",1
Complete garbage...items not really presented in relevant details with respect to standard industry practices. What you will learn here is not how things are done on the job.,1
"Most of the information in this course is common sense. It may be relevant for someone with very limited knowledge about food, but for anyone who is moderately informed and interested in food, there is not much to learn here.",1
"Inconsistent course content, presenters hop between topics, complete lack of definitions, absense of content structure. Moreover, the presentation style is very boring. One thing is for sure - avoid attending finance at university of Geneva by all costs.",1
You need to have deep knowledge in matlab to get pass the assignments. I have spent more time figuring out how the simulations are implemented that really learning about the target algorithm to implement.,1
"I am really sorry that a course with such a good content is ruined by the unrealistic assignement of week 4. That assignment will at least take 6 weeks to do and that should naturally lead to course length of 10 or 11 weeks which would be realistic. So if you pay money for it, start the course and do it till week 4, than pause and do the assignment and restart at a later date in order to comply to the necessary tasks. The creators of this course did not react to our cries of help within a week. Poor support from them - the coursera team tried to help but obviously in vain. What I learnt for future courses: I will look into the detail of every assingment before starting and paying. Unfortunately in some courses you can´t even look into the assignments when you haven´t paid. This should be changed. Because I consider it a trick to lure someone into an interesting course and then making it impossible to finish it in the given timeframe. Not being able to see what will be demanded prior to paying may also be a coursera policy problem. So maybe there is a better platform than coursera that lets you to be clear of what is ahead of you. For a learner this is of great value: honesty, transparency and realistic information - because I have to plan and schedule how much time I can take for learning!",1
The worse course ever,1
"I have sat through 4 of the lessons and I am not very impressed. I fell that the topic is very interesting, but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms. It may be because I do no have the textbook, but overall a rather poor course. There need to be a little more explanation beyond the slides.",1
This is only theory related to the evolution of the systems. How their features change over the time.I personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything.,1
Lots of bugs,1
"This course is absolute garbage. You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing.The lectures are clearly from a math perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the slides. His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead.",1
"Unfortunately, not very engaging.",1
Its a very superficial course. It feels like the instructor is just reading out from some material. And it is not making it interesting to listen. The instructor is not putting in much effort to make student understand the concept. That's the reason for me to drop out in between the course. This course is not at all much informative and neither it is improving my grasp on the topic.,1
the wieos are not targeting online students. The videos are long but not teaching many things. The course is too gneral.,1
not worth the money.,1
"this course is very basic, provides a lot of information that's not really practical or useful. i suppose someone who's seeing internet for the first time would find it informative, but not very engaging. as for the majority of those who use coursera to self-educate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious. also I'd like to mention the delivery of the information - its a text that's read aloud. nothing more - well, thanks for that. I can read faster than I can listen to a video. if you're making a video - make it worth actually WATCHING.",1
He teaches even worse then me. This course has no practical example. It's just introduction(from start to end).When I enrolled in this course I was expecting that at the end of this course I will be able to develop an app or anything like that. But know I think that I have just wasted my time.,1
"thanks for the course, but-your quizzes is real pain, some random variable could cause wrong result-your should follow how it is implemented in lectures in stupid way, like ""efficient"" way when you build hash map N^2 instead of N-bluej sucks you make a lot of clicks to run method, use some decent IDE like eclipse or idea",1
"The concepts here are useful and Mr. Egger is a knowledgeable instructor but 1) this class is really about gathering information with Excel as the tool - you aren't learning anything about Excel functionality, so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in Excel 2) there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this, it seems like that's not going to change. 3) the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldn't be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions. Mine sat unanswered for 5 days as the deadline passed. You are NOT going to get support if you dont understand something.",1
"This is very basics hence getting a certificate is not valuable. I would consider getting a certificate, if it means something hence beyond a very basic crash course. The certification, should be, I can really use and means something.",1
"Too many lectures, specialized audience with huge competition, not accessible by novices of philosophy and only assessed through a single peer-reviewed assignment-essay.",1
"I don't know how useful the ambiguous requirements exercise is when we only have one-way feedback. I also think that the ambiguous requirements exercise is the most important of the course, and the exercise missed the mark.I would suggest you structure that exercise as a dialogue, where a PM is working with the customer to elicit requirements, and not give us a big long wish-list of functionality. Structured as a dialogue, you can show that a PM would ask, ""You said that the game would make noise. When is the first time it makes noise? How often would game noises be made? Does it ever stop? What makes it stop? Why even have the game make noise in the first place? Are there different noises made during the course of game play/""So, I can't recommend this particular course, and I'm concerned about what the capstone will look like if you give us an assignment where we're to make sense of functionality delivered as a block of text .",1
a 10 page reading could have make it. not enough material to be consider a course,1
The JAVASCRIPT part of the course was to difficult for me I didn't understand enough. I would like to see more tutorial.,1
"Thank you for this course. It was interesting and helpful. Before.But I failed. I got bad mark and I don't know why.I have only one good comment. But I have 3 bad marks and only 2 good. I am a looser, i guess.So I hate this course, this website, this review system and this world.Thank you again.",1
"Complete waste of time. This should be a course on its own, and much less be charged for. This should have been the 1st week of an actual class. This only dealt with installing a couple of software tools. Hopefully the following courses will teach something worthwhile.",1
"I slogged through it and got an 89, but the videos were boring and the quizzes were poorly worded and should have had greater correlation with the course content.",1
Not enough material to understand the concepts.,1
"Hello all. I'm glad I took this course successfully. However, I have some notes. As a 4th year medical student, I see that the information is superficial. I finished the course in around 3 weeks, so medical students wouldn't get so much benefit out of the course. I wanted to learn more details, specially in depth about each type of the 5 cancers from the basics to clinical. Secondly, there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs. Thirdly, I believe that the assessment was too easy. I suggest a 60% passing grade with a more challenging assessment. Finally, this is my personal opinion. I enjoyed the course and I would like to see more improvement in the future.",1
"Not very applicable -just a bunch of concepts.It feels like a very disorganised course.Paul Harris is extremely repetitive and takes so much time to get to the point. Sometimes he over-explains unnecessary things. His lectures need serious upgrade.Lecturers speak too slow, I have to use the 1.5x speed not to fall asleep.",1
"Not about the actual effect of food on your health, it's just a cookbook.",1
"Too long videos, you should make more short videos, instead of one boring long video. You speak too slow and that makes a 8 minutes video turns into 30 minutes video.",1
"There are no clearly defined learning outcomes at the start of each video which are cramped with stats and facts and statements such as ""you will learn more about this in mooc 2"" and ""this will be talked about extensively in mooc 3"". As a learner its confusing to know what to take out of each video.The extend to which students are used to promote the course by prompting them to tweet about the videos is a concern. Ones or twice is okay. But every time?The assignment is a miss - students should be given a choice whether they want to focus on marketing their professional personas or marketing their business.I can summarize MOOC 1 in one sentence. Social Media is big and therefore business must change the way they do marketing.",1
Too theoretical and completely disliked it. Even too basic for an introductory course. I paid it and got unitl week 4 and just couldn't find the motivation to continue.,1
very watered down,1
"Interesting statistical concepts, and great theory. However, the lectures and the quizzes do not prepare the student well for the final project.",1
"I found the course content to be too simple, hence uninteresting.",1
"It must be taught by someone who can speak english clearly. Sorry but I couldn't understand what Mercedes Paniccia spoke, which made the course even more difficult to understand. There are subtitles but it's not possible for everyone to put that much effort. This issue must be taken seriously to make this MOOC much better.",1
"Boring voice. A lot of overcomplicated terms, where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way. In result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people, but just to read it. Disgusting.",1
"Quality of the video and sound are bad; a few minutes after starting a lesson, sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more... This made me stop the course.",1
very basic. for novices. not worth it to pay money for it,1
"I thought this course was very disappointing, to the point where I'm not able to finish it. In week one, we learned some basics. In week two, the entire language was dumped on us with no real exercises. Then we were asked to write some programs. The programs didn't build knowledge piece by piece - it was just learn the language, now write these random programs. It was very disappointing. I sign up for courses because I want to learn piece by piece and get to practice each new thing. If someone is going to dump the whole of Ruby on me in 1 week I don't need the class, I can buy a book and get the same experience. There also wasn't a good grader provided. This really took the joy out of programming. I keep thinking I'll come back and finish the class but I haven't so far because I dislike how it's presented so much. A true disappointment.",1
"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1
"This is purely subjective, but I could not keep myself awake and sustain interest long enough to finish the one section I paid for. I guess I should have tried one for free first...I tried to tell the Coursera staff to remove the course from my list and that I did not need my refund, but sadly, it sits on my 'enrolled courses' list, perhaps permanently until I cancel my account. Luckily, I did figure out how to turn off the almost twice daily notifications.",1
"I requested for a refund and I did not receive it. I guess I won't get it until about 2 weeks. I want a refund because it's too easy, this is stuff I learned in freshman biology. It's nice that it offers resources and links however, I wanted to take a course and get a certificate in one at my level to prove that I can learn beyond a high school biology level. And the course says it's for educators but it doesn't go into much detail on how to actually teach the information. I guess this is good if you want to be a substitute at a middle school or high school, but it's not for me. I was looking for something that was more so at a college level. Also on the important information, they sort of skim over sometimes. I'm 19, I'm not in school because I don't want to waste thousands of dollars on stuff that's elementary so I don't think I could get any special benefits and get courses for free, but that's also the reason why I'm on here, but I'm disappointed to have wasted 50 dollars if they aren't going to refund me. I can barely afford 50 dollars, I'm unemployed and no one will hire. I wanted to take a course in something that would at least get me some kind of job or volunteer work within my field of interest. Seriously, not even these minimum wage jobs will hire you if you didn't go or aren't going to college. Just wanted to feel like I accomplished something suited to my level.",1
"Lecture uses ""you know"" so much, that I couldn't hear enything else.",1
The new platform Sucks!!!The people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quizzes unlike the old platform. Not being able to take the quizzes completely ruins the learning experience.,1
"This was not really a course, but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talks at all. If this was a way for Kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well. Talks were short with no real matter in them fill with jokes just to make time with them. I am sorry I did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it.",1
Bad Lecturers and instructions.,1
C,1
Boring,1
"Just following a text book, without an added value from the lectures.",1
"This is the specialisation that sucks all joy out of the entire course. 6 month on and I am still on week 2. The software and the provided files are not fully working, something is always missing, constant error messages... If you don't have background in statistics, you will have a very difficult time.",1
What a shame. English subtitles were promised and not arranged. I truly wanted to learn this course. Obviously Coursera doesn't care.,1
"Could not follow very easily. Confused, gained nothing from the lectures. Really no substance to it.",1
"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?I am a member of your site for many years and I have also recommended your site in many people.",1
"Total disaster. I payed 315euro for this course. Course started on 24/10/2016. I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend. I reported this problem already many times.. Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment. I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment. I read discussions, write post.. Searched on Google.. Read lots of document. I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants. I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam. In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund. But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!! Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!!",1
"This is not a business course. Explaining what an email is, and how to send attachments is completely irrelevant information.The title of the course should be more appropriate - Introduction to email, what is it and how to use it. Or something that gives people the idea that the course is about very basic information about emails.",1
"coursea does not allow me to quit the class. Also, I cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace.",1
"This course has nothing to do with Excel. It should be called ""Statistic and binary modelling with little use in excel"". If you except to learn about functions, pivot tabels, macros and the many other exciting features of excel, this is NOT the course for you.",1
"lecturer is very monotone and isn't engaging. Course also focuses a lot on the history when it would be more relevant to look to the future. It is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable, people do not read the submissions fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone else's work. People also have different standard which causes a large variation in grades. Grading rubric does not include areas for where extra research has been done either",1
"This course was frustrating, the learning curve nearly vertical, the material dense and inaccessible, and the evaluative assignments impossible for new users of R without outside resources. No one should take this course unless they are powering through it for the Data Science specialization. Otherwise, would-be students should just buy an R For Dummies book, and use materials elsewhere.",1
"No teaching. Just a guy talking. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.",1
This class does not go in depth enough for debutant people to figure out how to do the assessments or gain a good understanding of what is covered.,1
"The video lectures provide an introduction to quadrotor flight dynamics and path planning. The lectures are ok.Unfortunately:At least one of the coding assignments has a significant bug in the termination condition. The mentors will ignore any help requests that deal with the bug in their code.The assignments involve a lot of hand tuning of PD controllers. That's a reasonable task to perform once or twice, but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taught.The final assignment doesn't do a particularly good job evaluating the required test condition.If you do take the course I'd want you to know:You should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugs.There are no ""gotcha"" quiz questions. If you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to re-try your answer. There seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set up.On the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in ""real time"". Removing that step makes the simulation run much more quickly and allows for faster iteration.To conclude:This is a course with a lot of potential, but unless Coursera makes an effort to improve the course I would not recommend it.",1
"Most video's are spoken in a sort of 'Franglais' that is barely understandable, very annoying.",1
Too compact and short. Should be integrated to other courses.,1
"It's almost desk work, not practical.",1
"This course is clickbait for the purpose of soliciting information about the private life of participants. It barely contains any facts, and it contains in total zero references to studies that facts are taken from. This shouldn't be on Coursera, and an organization making a course like this shouldn't be allowed to call itself a university.",1
"elementary school level program, not college or university",1
"Not that much techniques to learn just general course about social media,So it's not cost effective !",1
"This is an advanced Statistics class. Learning was chaotic, confusing, and fast paced. Strong Mathematics skills required. As icing on the cake, there is an 8 hour project at the end of the course .. and they only tell you at the end that you should have been working on this all along! Not at all what I wanted to learn or find productive in the real world.",1
"The lectures are very well-organized. The topics are also cover in this field. However, the lectures are very dry and boring. The main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor. From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail. I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive. I'm sorry, it is not what I expected.",1
The preceding courses were interesting and helpful. This capstone project lacked substance. The project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course. It's almost exclusively about customer analytics. I would not be surprised if Yahoo! worked with Wharton and Coursera to launch this course in order to crowd-source ideas on how to turn around the company.,1
"Would not let me leave course after signing up. Due to family issues, I could not continue, but due to some weird policy, after purchasing this class, I could not drop. (Still can't)",1
"It was really boring, hard to keep watching the videos and doing the activities. There was some stuff that could be interesting but you can find it somewhere else.",1
Too US-centric. Very strange concept of non-monetary benefits. It very common to forgo cash remuneration for non-monetary benefits (mainly for tax advantages) which was largely ignored in this course.,1
"I've done a few online courses on various, and for me, this is poor. The content is gratingly simplified, the delivery worse. The instructions for the assignments are impenetrable at best. Unfortunately, I can't gain those moments that I've spent on this course back.",1
Really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is. I came here to learn about Excel. Pivot tables? functions? The course really loses focus and its unfortunate that I am now stuck here and cannot continue the entire specialization.,1
"Horrific. If I could rate this ZERO I would. The instructor will give you a one sentence explanation and definition for a term (literally, I downloaded the transcripts to help with my notes and assignments) and then say, ""Now that we learned x..."" and fly right into the next term. Worse, many of the sentences don't even make sense and completely incoherrant, even in the written transcript. I am having to go out and find additional textbooks to research the basic definitions of what is required to pass the course. There is even less explanation of real-world applications, examples, and demonstration. It is almost as though she tried to memorize a sheet of definitions and repeated them without the use of her notes. This results in a highly monotonous monologue with awkward gestures and little actual content. I was planning on going for the PR for Digital Media Certification, but I can't handle another course like this. It's a waste of time and money.",1
"I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that this is a poorly made course for building a thorough understanding of how these different Neural Networks actually function, and building a lower level understanding. The lecturer often introduces concepts that are specific to these types of neural networks without explaining what they are. For example, when discussing convolutional nets, he casually starts talking about an embedding layer and a mapping layer, without really explaining what it is. I found this video on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6aEYuemt0M) and realized that this gives me a significantly more concrete understanding of how convolutional neural networks actually function, than these lectures.",1
This course would be much better if there was some actual substantive content. This course was not worth 35$.,1
"R is really just the worst, and the instructors do not make it better. The code in this class is unreadable:- too many one liners, because ""it's faster to write"", though harder for other people to read- variables are named cryptic things like spIns or x, rather than names with meaning (eg, sprays.by.insect), again ""because it's faster to type""- way too many cases of ""there is more than one way to do it"", which just makes things confusing because the other ways tend not to be equivalentWhat I'm most concerned about is that I've seen lots of poorly written code in many different languages: Java, C++, C, Python, Perl, and now R. But I've also seen really well-written code in all the languages *but* R, I have yet to see any code in R that is flexible, maintainable, and clear. Which leads me to think that no such code exists, or it's so rare that it doesn't matter. It is clear to me that if I am to do data analysis, then I will need a different set of tools; but because this specialization is taught entirely around R (the lectures are about R, not about higher-level concepts), then this specialization is not useful to me.",1
I was quite disappointed with this class. The videos and instructions are very short and the information is lacking. When reviewing other classmates material it was quite clear that people were confused with the assignments because I saw such a huge range of submissions that were very different from each other.I found the material to be very similar to the first course in this specialization; both asked very similar things but this class didn't add much to the process.,1
"Inattentive lectures. There're only a few videos that are worth watching. You need to be prepared for wasting a lot of time for programming assignments -- it's not because the assignments are tough but because of poor descriptions and out of sync with lectures. If you're interested, just download the online material (not videos) and read through it. Much better than wasting your time with the lecture videos and assignments.",1
Shame that it was not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created. Please see the course as just a training sales promotion for his ML application.,1
"I'm sorry that I'm going to sound harsh, but this course is useless.It touches so many different topics without going deeply into any of them. All you get is a basic knowledge about All Things Cyber™.The recommended readings are all over the place, the video captions look like they're just a basic speech recognition and like nobody actually proof read them. They're full of errors. Lecturers say one word, captions show a completely different word. Plus, they're full of spelling errors. (Kadafi regime in Libya!? Really!?)You can get the same amount of knowledge by reading two or three Wikipedia pages. Don't waste your time on this course.",1
Audio is terrible - can't continue,1
"Not really well produced for the media. Too much instruction of the teacher, few practice instead.",1
This course is just pulling the knowledge without basic logic. I have no idea what I have learned.,1
Very poor presentation and content. Difficult to navigate and all the links used including that for Galaxy are outdated. There was no effort made to provide a method to get through the course given all the changes since the videos were recorded. This course is the reason I have decided not to pursue the specialization it falls under.,1
"The guy is full of shit. He's just trying to sell you his book and his online game product. He was also obsessed with bragging about all of his accomplishments. I was quite disgusted by him at the end. I paid for the certification, but now I want my money back.",1
"Difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audio, meaning I spend 90% of my effort trying to make out what she's saying. As it turns out, all she does is read from the slides! no additional insight, nothing. This makes it boring to hear and she comes across with no personality (although a quick rate-my-professors search tells us a very different story, a real shame since people seem to really like her). At any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement, I've decided to call it quits.",1
"This course, starting from week 3 in NOT for beginners at all. If you are truly new to programming you would understand nothing from the Java Script part of the course. A lot of people complain about the same issue during the course.",1
The instructors overly explain simple concepts and talk about programming inbetween makes the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that was not properly explaiuned,1
"Un-organized, scattered non professional course. All the materials keep changing during the course. Materials in each module includes readings and exams were not related. Though, I enjoyed the other courses in this series and think they were great, but I am afraid this one was a real disappointment.",1
Startinng it now,1
"This course only works if u pay, which is shit coz most people dont have money...",1
Poor quality videos make the course less appealing and make it seems to be unprofessional,1
I think there are only few contents.,1
"I think it's useless. Spending that amount of time explaining this basics it is not worth it. I'd rather go deeper in AngularJS, NodeJS or Ionic, after all this is a course for a mid level, so you should go to another course to take the basics and here a more advanced level.",1
The instructor was terrible. Very dull,1
No systematic presentation of concepts. Very hard to follow.,1
I wish they spent more time on the content of videos and less on the silly effects and 30-second intro and outro sequences. Practically every question of the final comes word-for-word from a book not assigned in the module readings and not available for free to students for them to study. I won't be taking any other courses from this school if this course was an indication of quality.,1
There isn't any real teaching happening. I guess this isn't a course for beginners.,1
"Overly-remedial information, but that is not what earns this course such a poor evaluation from me. The poor evaluation comes from the composition of the review quizzes: The end-of-section quizzes ask questions to which there can be more than one correct answer, yet only a single response will receive credit.Example: ""A recommended solution to a problem is valued by an executive because..."" Followed by four possible answers: One of which is clearly incorrect while one makes an awful assumption. These two choices can be eliminated easily. However, the final two options are BOTH UNARGUABLY CORRECT, but only one was briefly mentioned in the material (reading or video), and thus only that one receives credit.Unfortunately, this demonstrates the course creators' desire to value a student's memorization of the instructor's own unique words over the student's assimilation of the course content and ideas.Course-takers beware, this course seems more tailored to stroking Ms. Bravo's ego than to you actually learning anything of commercial value.",1
Just overview of the common technologies. Useless course,1
"This course is structured around a specific and costly Python library called Dato. It is possible to do the homework without it, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to do so. If the course wasn't structured around using Dato, it would be a lot simpler and a easier to complete the assignments. Also, a lot of the mathematical notation was written in a kind of psuedo Python code that made things confusing sometimes.",1
"Poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation. The lectures are too fast and high level, with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it.",1
Doesn't worth the effort. You learn the most by searching online tools each time you encounter a problem while solving a quiz problem or following the steps the instructor did.,1
"Very poorly presented course. Despite having completed quite a number of coursera courses before, and even being already familiar with a good deal of the preliminary material in this one, i soon abandoned it due to the inadequate and scrappily prepared presentation of material. Mercedes Paniccia in particular speaks in a virtually unintelligible expressionless monotone with no explanation or elaboration to relieve what amounts to little more than a list of definitions and bald statements such as can be found in the glossary section of many textbooks. I would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook.",1
"the course neither explains statistics properly, nor teaches how to use excel effectively, disappointed",1
The first three weeks are totally trivial. I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called. (Maybe good for school students.) Week 4 is better. I recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four. Some real-world examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well.,1
TOO DIFFICULT,1
"I didnt like this course. I found it to be confusing. Compared to other CSS JS HTML Courses such as the one from Michigan or Hong Kong Universities which are quite clear and crispt and refreshing, this seems like a work in progress. Confusing, convoluted, odd.HTML CSS JS Are Actually not very difficult.This course makes u question your own name. Makes you think basic math is Calculus. It needs work. Lots and Lots of work. I cant recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning JS HTML or CSS. It accomplishes the exact opposite.With regards to that Chinese Restaurant field trip. What the hell man? Is this a joke? Have the lady call 1800 Web . Com and have a cookie cutter just add water web site. This segment is silly.The rest of the segments? Confusing.",1
Extremely boring and not,1
The course does not allow students to take part in quizzes before paying for it.but the quality of the course material is amazingly high and easy to follow.,1
need to change the instructor and the way the course is being taught,1
"way too slow and too long ; too many digressions, by-side remarks, lessons of life, etc ... go straight to the point.",1
Too elementary. I would recommend this course for non-technical managers or security/coding beginners under the age of 13.,1
"The material itself isn't bad, but the course instructors never respond to questions. What's the point of the class if I can't get my questions answered?",1
"This is a very badly adjusted curse for the Coursera frame - I've encountered several quiz questions where I was supposed to write an answer in, but this option was not activated for me.Moreover, this course is dramatically prolonged - while the information provided can be easily put into 1-2 days, a week the most, it is somehow is stretched into 5 weeks. Taking into account that the course in a list of measures for a successful weight loss, it's justified to provide the strategies sooner in order to help those willing to start losing weight start doing that. The remaining 5 weeks would be great to help the students track their progress and get some peer-support.The system of not being able to submit any assignment or quiz until you pay for the course is vastly uncomfortable. the ability to self-check the weeks passed should be provided otherwise.The assignments for peer-grading are unnerving - how should peers grade my weight-goals? This is a direct ground for further body-shaming.The course is unfortunately very primitive and lacks further user-friendly design and review.",1
Not for new programmers. The lecture material is also not logically organized and does not correspond to the assignments.,1
Thanks Dr Matthew you're the bestMr Marco I didn't understand anything from you and I stopped the course because I dropped this module because of you. I'm sorry,1
"Not being allowed to submit quizzes without paying for the course - I am withdrawing from the course and any other Coursera courses where this is the policy - I will enrol in other free online course sites where the are ""free"".",1
"Excellent teaching, but it's not actually free. You must pay in order to access the assignments and the professor's in-browser python sandbox.",1
Impossible to navigate to the course material. Took my payment but insists on another payment before it will let me submit an assignment. Very frustrating. I am about to request a refund.,1
Got lost and left behind very quickly even after watching videos numerous times and doing additional research. There were videos missing even with deadlines approaching. Some videos were very well explained while others I didn't understand at all.,1
"No actual class, just for selling books.",1
"The Course is acceptable, however, it should be called, Introduction to VoIP communication or Developing VoIP applications rather than its current title.Assignments are either super easy or never have a right answerPersonally, I will not recommend this course for other who want to understand IoT",1
This should not be a course in itself,1
"I would have rated this course with 5 stars if it wasn't for the Autograder that marked the final assignment, which made that I didn't even get to pass the course, although, according to me and everyone I had contact with regarding this course, my code was correct! Everything else was very well done, and I congratulate Ms. van Lent on her course. I will be going on to the next course in this specialization, because all the autograders for the rest of it has been removed. Thank goodness!",1
lectures are too fast.dropping out.,1
Material for the course is outdated.,1
"1)the course is very abstract and is looks more like an obvious advertisement. Less than 10% contains useful information and the rest is describes the same idea ""Cloud is good"" with various words and phrases.2)buggy. And the worst thing is one of the last tasks contain a bug which doesn't allow you to pass this course. So you've completed all the tasks and in the end you find out that you just can't finish the course.3)The course is about ""Cloud"" as a technical term. Then why in the end you require to complete a task which is fully philosophical? And of course again - you have completed a course and in the end instead of finished course you will get this ""sucker punch"".Good luck to everyone who wants to try to pass this course because in my opinion it means a wasted time.",1
"1 for Knitr, otherwise it's waste of time.",1
"Really poor approach to grade this course. Regardless of the effort put in on assignments, peer reviews are inconsistent, unguided and poor as a result, bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course. There is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise. Personally I would not recommend",1
"This course proved to be a waste of time. There was nothing about the structure and forms of the strong quartet, just ""here's a good one to listen to."" Almost complete devoid of intellectual content.",1
"About two years ago I completed Dr. Mine's course ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" and was quite impressed by it. I always hoped that there'd be a follow up on bayesian statistics, so I was really excited when I heard that a course on this topic had finally been created. However while attending the course I became more and more disappointed. Dr. Mine does a nice job explaining things, other teachers in this course aren't as talented. Most slides / videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations. Also I was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors. MCMC is only skimmed over and the introduction to MCMC is more than questionable - instead of showing a simple example, MCMC is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection. Another point is R - this course doesn't really teach bayesian stats with R. It teaches how to call one-liners like bayes_inference (from package statsr) or bas.lm (from package BAS) instead of lm. This is totally disappointing. I wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on MCMC sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using JAGS/STAN/PyMC/whatever. For anyone interested in bayesian stats I'd recommend reading ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - Using R, JAGS, and STAN"" and ""Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers"". These books are actually cheaper than this course.",1
"It is a poor course because is not properly designed for internationals. Language is mainly French in slides and subtitle is not that helpful.Instead of spending time outside to read the notes, it was better to prepare helpful slides for students to understand better what you are talking about.",1
"This course was supposed to be the last one before capstone and what did we learn:· Nothing about electronic· Huge amount about networking on very basic level – question is what are people without this knowledge at all doing in IoT course· How you can tweet from Raspberry Pi (hey, is somebody crazy here)· Lot of words about camera, few minutes about servo motor and that’s all.We have to write a web server update which is completely unexplained and no one didn’t do it because no one understood it that way (despite the fact that webserver is webserver and server is server) and during whole course no one update the task definitionThere is no discussion board, it was turned off during earlier courses and for me only explanation is that no one from UCI doesn’t care and the certificate for course cost $80-$90.Very pathetic approach which I can only explain with 2 words: “Easy money”",1
"The assignments do not give you any practical methods for actual problem solving. They're just a succession of activities that pretend to be creative by making you do things ""you wouldn't normally do"". It's like they forgot the part about ""problem solving"".The assignments are to eat foods you've never eaten, talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to, take a photo of yourself smooching someone/something, and to ""give"" something to someone you ""never have given anything before"". That is not creative nor helpful at problem solving. It's just a series of activities for people who have too much time on their hand and need something to do to get out of their routine.Not a course I would recommend for anyone wanting to gain useful skills.",1
"Need more (understandable) subtitles. Peer-review for this course is not a good idea as well, given abstract concepts and different language.",1
"If the course had the same information and effort as week1 over all 4 weeks i would gave 5 stars, although the assignments are pretty good and I learnt something new, however the assignments are fun but the grader is annoying as the single error output is..... something is wrong... try again?!",1
"This course needs much more work from instructors before it gets offered to the public. It is poorly assembled, offers hardly comprehensible material with no or very few resources to turn to. Reading material is listed, but they are useful for people already skilled in Bayesian Statistics. Exercises are worded such, that even the questions are a challenge to understand. Quizzes contain material never mentioned during lessons. Discussion forums are left unanswered by the teaching staff - or if they reply, they do it in a very negligent manner. No support on the merits. A major disappointment.",1
Not recommended. Not clear why we need to use R and learn all this statistics. Not practical for use in UX design.,1
"This is NOT a beginner's course. There is not enough coverage of fundamental programming concepts, and too much playing around with complex application concepts such as Steganography. Simple image manipulation is a good way to teach programming concepts. Teaching bit arithmetic in a first programming course is NOT. Also, there are many errors in the videos that should be corrected. And finally, this course is advertised as requiring 3-5 hours per week. What a huge underestimate! I have been programming professionally since 1989. Other than week 1, every week requires closer to 8-10 hours at least. Stop advertising this as a beginning course, or restructure it such that it is more appropriate for beginners.",1
Poorly designed and explained. You do not really gain much knowledge from this course.I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course. There are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices.,1
"This course wasn't good. Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written, and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them. The assignments also weren't very deep or imaginative, and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts. The design principles were introduced at such a surface level as to be just silly rather than useful. This was kind of a waste of my time.",1
This course is really bad. I didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials I could do it.,1
This Course is not really free. You must pay to access quizzes and peer graded assignments.Coursera is really moving downhill quickly in terms of free course offerings. It's such a pity.,1
"I can't believe this course is aimed at people with no experience in building a website. The videos are actually slide shows and use too few screenshots. Had this been my very first introduction to how a website was built I would never have progressed any further than these lessons. Much more in-depth information is necessary, including step by step screenshots of various processes.Terrible course.",1
"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view.Furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",1
it is very boring course no coding just watching a lady talking and talking and talking it is really very boring to do that,1
I felt the course went far too fast and is definitely NOT a course for beginners. I gave up after the 2nd week and I now feel more than ever overwhelmed by setting my own website.,1
"Unforyunately all the information is rather basic, most of the knowledge provided is intuitively understandable. Didn't learn anything new. Probably the problem is that it really is super basic and may be useful for somebody who is doing 1-2 year of Bachelor's.",1
"Smile on the face of professor is missing, otherwise 5 stars.",1
The last peer review is really hard to do. Hard is because the wording is very ambiguous and not all understand how to review. There was a guy who answered with SQL query. This is hardcore since we have not learned that yet...,1
I get really frustrated when the tutor doesn't explain lots of concept/symbols in the materials.....,1
This is ok and I enjoyed the humour and feeble running gags in the lectures.But it doesn't justify the rip-off pricing at all.,1
"I thought you would learn how to actually create a website, not just how to pick and install a premade wordpress theme.",1
"The EEPROM project in week 3 is undoable with the specified simulator, as the simulator is simply not functional. I tested different computers, windows and mac operating systems, different browsers, different security settings, etc. Nothing works. The assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course. In addition, the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems. Speaking of which, a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of 2015. Seriously, what the hell? Many people don't have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage, and you are selling a defective product.",1
"I took all 5 previous courses in this series and they were all great.But suddenly Coursera has changed its policy, and one can not take courses for free anymore.If you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate, than the course is useless, because you can't receive feedback for your work.",1
This course is not designed well.,1
"Poor context, no real examples. The guy just reads what is written on the slides without further explanations.",1
very bad demonstration,1
Speaker is not energetic or something lacking.. makes it boring.,1
"This is probably the most pedagogically inept course I have ever enrolled on. Although the content is what you would hope to find in such a course, the delivery of it is outrageously bad. When to complete your assignment, Google becomes your best friend rather than your lecture notes, you know that something is wrong. The idea that a baby thrown in the water may just learn to swim rather than drown is pedagogically retarded. Unfortunately, this seems to be the approach here...",1
"This is the worst course I've ever listened, and I've listened my fair share of online courses! Do this course ONLY if you want to complete whole specialization!Professor is simply awful, English is not her native language obviously, but even that is not the problem, she simply speaks sentences that doesn't make sense at all! And she obviously doesn't have computer science background, if she does then she is even worse then I thought.",1
The peer review is a bad bad idea.,1
"If you have to pay for the certificate itself, then the course can't be too serious or maybe even that much helpful.",1
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
"Only able to audit the class, no longer able to take quizzes and tests. I recommend the Python classes from Michigan over these if you are looking to avoid paying for old material.",1
The reason why I am giving only one star that the course did not covered much information and the time allotted could have been less than 4 weeks. So it was not really worth the money.,1
"It is impossible to input solutions to quizzes/exams - even when they are correct, they are graded as wrong - a massive waste of time",1
i was very excited at the beginning of the coursebut when i figure out that i must paid for unlock some important lecturei really felt disappointed i thought i should only paid if i want to took the Certificatei had been wasted some time at this coursenow i have to search for another course but complete one this time.,1
"This instructor is god-awful, I'm sorry to say. By the 3rd week, I stopped caring about this class, and my grade for that week definitely expresses my disinterest. I'm having to force myself to finish it. Has she ever taught a class before? I felt like this was her first time. Uninspired - not looking forward to her next class.",1
"Drink everytime the lecturer said ""Google"" without reason. You won't make it 5 minutes.The content of the lecture can be shorter, too much commercials in the lecture. The questions don't echo what was in the lecture (vs AWS for example).",1
"Big part of the course videos devoted to history of how the technology was developed, not much technical information about the technology itself.",1
"the content is too rich, and the explanation is too little. The no-feedback exam is misleading, difficult to pass. The course staff is not that helpful.",1
"Hands down the worst course on Coursera. I thought it might be beneficial to take this course but it doesn't cover anything in details. Wherever algorithms are explained, a really lousy job is done. To be specific, first and second weeks are covered badly. I am still trying to understand the material by reading external articles on the course topics. I think that first course of this specialization was pretty great and this one is disappointing.",1
I did not enjoy how this course was taught. It was confusing and hard to understand the professor did not go at a pace i found helpful.,1
"Unfortunately I think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for, it has a very local perspective of logistics (not involving international logistics but only US operations), there's no communication with the professor or assistants, so it's basically watching a few very short videos explaining general concepts that apply only to certain types of operations.The assignments are very vague, with no requirements or restrictions provided, basically anyone can write anything and as long as you follow the requested format it will be graded ok; grading is not based content and therefore there's no way to know whether you're learning and applying the concepts properly or not.Wouldn't recommend paying for it.",1
Bad video quality and errors in course material. Worst course on Coursera.,1
Would have greatly preferred if open source tools were used.,1
I do not like the Course. Too difficult for me. Slides are too full of written lines that professor Navarro simply reads.,1
"The worst course I've ever take in Coursera. I can pass the course all because I have some background of this topic. The lecture taught me NOTHING!Consider I just finish the previous course ""algorithm for DNA sequencing"" which might be the best course I toke in the Coursera, this course makes me very disappointed! If the previous course gives me the faith to continue learning something in Coursera, this course must be the reason that let me leave the Coursera left.I can't even understand why there are some guys give this course 5 stars. If there is -5 stars option, I'll put this score in front of the lecturer and tell her WHAT A BAD COURSE her give us.",1
"Although the course was very useful, I couldn't complete the course due to an assignment. The assignment is very unrealistic and the graders don't give any feedback!! The assignment is open ended question and not difficult but took significant time, when I submit I was unable to pass.",1
"Huge gap between videos and final assignment.Videos should be edited, we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructors.",1
"Complete idiot. He doesn't have any critical view of his field (which is unfortunately full of crappy studies). Also, I hope he didn't choose the logo from his university. It's a good metaphor for the course though, shiny but absolutely ridiculous.",1
"The teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them. It will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time, the teacher could write R code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect.",1
Very bad way of teaching and not reach content,1
"Been asked to re-take all assignments *after* paying for a certificate! I wil never pay for a Coursera course again, and I would not recommend my friends to do so",1
very very bad session,1
Unacceptable assignments length! The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload. It took me 2 weeks (not 6 hours as tutor mentions) to complete half of the second assignment and I am about to tell that I learnt nothing about MongoDB. The videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet. The videos must change to include more details about the presented topic.I am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course.,1
Explanations not clear and feels like he's reading rather than explaining things.Consecutive videos feel like they are disconnected. Videos stop in the middle of him talking something. Thank god for the swirl assignments which make things much clearer!Also the course proceed very fast not giving enough time to the concepts.,1
boring,1
"Purely theoretical, I doesnt go deep enough, there arent any assignments, only a quiz at the end of the week. Poor material per week.",1
nothing helpful,1
"The two or three minute videos were annoying. I understand that this is what video marketing is about and, PS, not too many people truly watch the videos. Lessons should be 30 minutes each.",1
"there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience.to solve these problems I have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help.I agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.You can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week. Maybe 5 hours per day.Disappointed. I wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but I will most likely try to get back the money I spent on this and let it go.",1
Ended up not being able to take the rest of the courses I paid for because Coursera kept pushing it back... Start date after start date moved ....,1
"The course do not match its price at all, it is catastrofically sketchy. First time while using Coursera I am so much unsatisfied with some course.",1
"I am highly disappointed with the policy of providing the homework only to the paid participants. It seems this is gearing towards another means of making bussiness when it comes to education.I understand that grading and providing feedback requires effort and the fees charged is required to the cover those cost, but like before we must have an option to get access to the homework, allowing us to apply our learning while it maybe be acceptable not to have any feedback or certificate on the course completion.Currently, the closed homework policy goes against the basic objectives of MOOC and I hope it is reconsidered.",1
"This course has little or no information, not at all what was advertized, too much peer stuff",1
The professor was very goodbut there is a lot of assignments !!!a lot of record videos !!! every week !!! and the assignments it was very long for example 20 instruction for every assignment it is very boringmany people don't like record videos it is a bad idea,1
I am sorry but the Prof. doesn't know how to attract students to be more curious.,1
"The titles are interesting and curious to read, but the language is presentation of ideas is not coherent. The teacher does not provide practical techniques that can be used by a startup for marketing . I wish there were many more examples given and an applicable technique presented, that I could use as an entrepreneur.",1
The teacher's voice on first lessons are so flat and plain that is very boring to listen them. I left the course,1
"Very fast pace with no support. Be prepared to make countless online searches or to discuss solely with peers. Many drop out by the end of the course. Final Project is far too difficult for this course, because it did not prepare me at all. If you want to learn Android programming, I suggest you look elsewhere.",1
Very poor explanation and very complicated topics.,1
"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",1
"The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching. The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants. You're interested in this course either to (a) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and/or (b) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile. In both cases, move on. The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap.",1
"The course content is really poor, I do not recommend this course if you are actually interested in learning anything.",1
If I am auditing this class why can't the quizzes be free also?What happened to free Coursera?,1
"Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX, it is still very underwhelming. Priced at £39, the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks. It is hard to justify that for example ""week"" 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz... ""Week"" 4 is 15mins... Overall, I felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments (no hand-on experience can be gained, no peer -graded assignments).",1
1. We didn't have any feedback.2. I couldn't review my partners because there isn't projects to review.3. Teacher never answer forums.,1
Incorrect formulas. Very simplistic approach to subject matter,1
"For a beginners course I would expect more exercises about the different control structures and built-in mechanisms in Python. This course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loops, inputs, number conversions, file I/O and so forth.",1
"Very poorly constructed. There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary. The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks. There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material. This course suffers grossly from the ""curse of knowledge"". If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better. I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension. The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss. Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices. The program suggests that this is for ""beginners"". I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.",1
Filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbed-down and slow-paced. Offends the learner.,1
I should have never paid for this course. By the time I got into the subject the refund policy was expired. Do not take pay for this course or program at all.,1
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money!,1
The material and the lecture is not so engaging.,1
Buddhism conversion course.,1
Very Boring!!,1
"I do not recommend you to waste your time. Planned course activities for a week - just 13 minute speech of the lecturer, telling absolutely banal things and a few questions. Absolutely useless.",1
"I had very high hopes for this course. I was actually planning to purchase the specialization - just as a thank you gesture. Unfortunately, there is very little to be grateful for here.In this course, you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the math and physics behind the aerial robotics. I can't be the judge (since I hold a degree in this area), but I don't think you'll be able to get much if you aren't familiar with the topics yet. And you most certainly won't learn anything new if you had some previous training.And then suddenly there are assignments. That have almost nothing to do with the lectures, but require quite a bit of Matlab programming (did I mention you won't be taught any Matlab in the process?) To make things worse, the assignments are rather poorly explained.By the way, you won't get any replies from the course team - they even ignore questions about errors in lectures.The course looks very sloppy. As if someone forced the team to put together something for Coursera. A huge disappointment :(",1
"Instructor voice is too low and intro music is too high.Video quality is bad.Course content is for very beginners people, beginners to programming not only to Swift.Sorry to say it, but this course is really bad. Does not deserve to be in this specialization!",1
My initial impressions are of astounding mediocrity. Amazes me how academic careers are made these days.,1
the video is too long!,1
"Very disappointed about this course. The topic is very interesting, for me at least, but the course organization is horrible. Lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. Zero interaction from course staff. Issues with getting assignments graded. In previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk, but you cannot easily contact coursera directly.Main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating. Be warned and don't pay for this course!I really don't get why this course has so many good reviews.",1
So many better options out there to learn to code. The videos on this course had me so confused that I eventually gave up and went to another website to learn what I was supposed to be learning here. Asked a question on the forum that another student was also having a problem and nobody answered me.Very very boring. Try somewhere else.,1
"Excellent course content but very poorly designed quizzes. More clarity is needed in formulating questions, since different pages have different values for the same data sets (even on the same website such as the World Bank indicator datasets) and it will be difficult for students to get the right answers.",1
No forum + No email + No support whatsoever = Very frustrating,1
"Difference between a Software Project and a Software Product - of course it is defined by convention, but it is there and is pretty generally understood. Typical software projects are bespoke applications developed for the use of one organization and typically automates a business process. A S/w product, on the other hand, is built and sold to a range of users in the target group, who can be individuals to large organizations. This course does not seem to address any of the issues faced by a S/w Product Manager. I think this course completely misses the point.",1
"If you didn't like the first few lectures, you won't like the rest. It won't get better. More repetition, clichés, and advertisement that anything else.",1
"the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe. It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works, it's clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done. (further to the course timeframe) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions, which is very strange in a course for coaching. Not the mention video quality that is scary, I could not watch the videos, and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions.",1
"I signed up for this course hoping for a good introduction to OO programming and Java only to not be able to verify if I have even learned anything. Of course I can access the course material, but the fact that cannot even manually check if my answers are correct with certainty makes all of this less efficient than simply learning it by myself.",1
"It was interesting to a point, but there was no application of the knowledge gained. It was merely a regurgitation of facts.",1
Could not finish the course. I found the course to be boring.,1
"Way too many weekly lectures, way too many. In addition to that, lots of the lectures were too long and sometimes even meaningless. It was impossible to follow through.",1
"Not adapted to an online format. Low quality videos.Interesting topics, but no efficient progression. Many sections become an update about UCSD research, not adapted to the audience.",1
"Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material. Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.I previously took the Android Specialization, which was excellent, so I was shocked at how bad this course was.",1
"I find the week 6 of this course completely irrelevant. Also, I'm attending courses on Coursera to learn and quizzes are IMO an essential part of that process, but definitely not essays. For me personally, essays are just waste of time and there's nothing beneficial about them.Another thing that bugs me is how questionably and often misleadingly are thermodynamical laws interpreted by the professors in this course.",1
"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions.As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.",1
"I would have given this course NO stars at all if that option were available!!!The course is designed in contradiction of all the principles it preaches--there are no forums for the students, there is no way you could contact the instructor, the instructor keeps reading badly, stammering like a first-grader, speaks monotonously and there's no interaction whatsoever!Furthermore, there are mistakes in the quizzes and you have to choose blatantly wrong options if you want to get the 100% score!Although the subject matter about Virtual Instruction is pretty interesting and the instructor made it sound like the most boring thing in the world!Many of the links are outdated or not working at all and often the documents she refers to are 10 or more years old. Bear in mind that Virtual Instruction is a fast developing field and the technology as well as the legal framework are changing very fast too.In a nutshell, if this course were not a part of a Specialization track, I would not have paid for it.Unless you want to do the specialization, I wouldn't recommend this course or any by the UC Irvine because all of the lack forums and no channels for communication with the instructors!!!In one word BAD!",1
"The course presents lots of concepts and papers, but it doesn't really seems applicable in reality.It felt too ""fluffy"" and subjective to me.",1
"Underwhelmed. If this had been a free course I might have gone up to two stars, but I probably wouldn't have finished.This course attempts to take complex social awareness and patterns and reduce them to an understandable set of skills to be practiced... but it fails. I find it to be full of new-age dreamy ramblings that do not really help in the real world.Leadership is influence, which comes as a mixture of experience and intention. This course seems to discount experience in favour of ""sense"", used in this context as a poorly-translated summing up of the physical senses and their analysis.This course requires you to create an intimate written self-portrait, which you then find yourself sharing with a stranger and comparing. The exercise is interesting, and a lot of students have bought into the premise that this is a ""genuine conversation"" and allows them to explore their ability to know another person. I am the heretic in the room: I think the student wish to appear intelligent to their peers and the emperor is in fact shamefully unclad. If this is what the world considers a ""genuine"" conversation then the world is a shallower place than I had thought.This course, unfortunately, over-promises and under-delivers, and I am not in the least tempted to take the next one in the series. A good concept, but poorly planned, poorly translated, and poorly executed. Valerie clearly understands her topic but the summarizing of it for this framework is not a success.",1
Too expensive for what you get :(,1
Cannot follow a single thing that they are talking about. I have prior coding experience in other languages and I still have no idea what the instructors are getting at. They all explain everything horribly and jump into huge complex things with no explanation. Worst course I have ever taken in my life.,1
"Not a very interesting class, only learned some vocabulary and some pre made sentences, but no general structure or grammar. This means that it would be impossible for me to even guess how to form an other sentence with the words i know.",1
"Most of the effort in the creation of this course seems to have gone into the visual and acoustic effects of the slides. The first week's material has no substance whatsoever (literally!). The second week' s presentations are just listings of lengthy definitions and ""Best practices"" which in fact are mostly goals, not practices.With the poor quality of the provided videos, my hope was that the reading would be better. But the second week's reading are uncommented links to a 270 page NIST document, an Open Online Course(!!!) and OWASP material.At this point it is clear that continuing the course is not going to help me in the way I would expect it from a course. When I compare this to the excellent Software Security course of Michael Hicks (University of Maryland) , which I also attend on Coursera, there are worlds between both.I understand that ""Cybersecurity and its Ten Domains"" addresses students with less prior knowledge, but especially for such students I would expect a much better didactic approach.One star seems harsh, but after the first two weeks, the only words I find for this are: ""seriously?""",1
"Very very long lectures with ambiguous content. Many information provided are inaccurate, and the course doesn't teach neither programming concepts for beginners, nor high or even intermediate training for other developers.In my opinion, It's a waste of time.",1
Completely irrelevant material.,1
"I do not find very interesting this course. too many interviews. It could works for the first course, but not for the second. I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.",1
"I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.The code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working). Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's remedial work to be done for that too. Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated. It all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercises.The assignment instructions are unclear. You are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown. I also couldn't understand some of the grading criteria. You will get/lose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variables/functions a certain way.I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse. After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different. Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera.",1
"Too much theoretical. Probably this is not the course I was looking for when I joined it. Nevertheless, I will try to get some concepts from it, particularly for what concerns the practice of meditation and mindfulness.",1
$35 for this? duh,1
"I advice NOT to take this course.Why: the professor is never there to read your assignments. He leaves that totally to other students like yourself, to grade your written assignments, and, they do not read and give you a RANDOM grade in 2 seconds.Don't take it, you will waste sooo much time on this one.",1
I didn't find this course to be too helpful.,1
Very difficult to understand and follow,1
"Definitely not a course for a beginners, very confusing. The part with the Javascript is a real horror for beginners and even challenging for some newly programmers!",1
Bad content and instructor. no logistic in place. if you are planning to pay to get certificate. I would suggest look else where. my $279 are stuck in here and they don't reply to forum posts.,1
very tough to catch up.,1
the video is too long,1
very difficult to follow the lectures due to the heavy accent,1
Translation from English only on the first slides. I thought it at all lectures. Spent a lot of time beginning to study.,1
"Def a useful skills to have when starting to interview for jobs. This is a hard course to teach to begin with. I found the lectures really boring, too long, hard to understand and just not really motivated well. I think the homework problem are good, but they are very time consuming. You need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well, it's just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when you're only stuck in one test case. I think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things we've already covered in the previous week. At the moment, I don't think I'll continue this specialization the way it's designed.",1
I could not understand instructor. Using subtitles didn't help either as many words came up unintelligible.,1
Not a positive act to make people pay to be able to participate in the quizzes. The other audited classes allow everyone to participate in everything. We just do not become certified if we have taken the class for audit rather than credit.,1
"Content is too basic, seems unresearched. Instructor is distracting in manner in which he presents information - overemphasizes acting over content.",1
Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.,1
It said it was subtitled into English but that's only the first video...,1
"The course material itself is enjoyable, but the quizzes don't work properly. The feedback given to the same responses between retakes is contradictory.",1
"The topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good. The explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand. However, the amount of material covered is very little. I think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depth.Quizzes: The quizzes were very weak. They didn't really tell you weather you understood the concept or not. If one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was. So you have no idea which lecture you should watch again.Assignments: The assignments were very bad prepared. In some assignments there were bugs in the provided code, we weren't supposed to edit. The assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly, if there wasn't the grader. From the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed. Most of the time it wasn't the case that the algorithm failed, instead the output was not as expected by the grader, although it was as described in the assignment. But you never knew. This part has to be improved a lot.Overall I have to say that I expected much more from University of Pennsylvania, especially after taking the first part of the Specialization which was of good quality.",1
Never received a certificate or a grade. No one responds to email. I will never purchase anything through Coursera.,1
I learned very little from the course. The tests were easy. But that's because there was little to be learned.,1
"Very basic, for absolute beginners/ managers completely new to data (let alone data science)",1
A lot of speaking without any sense. Skip it at all cost,1
"Given that Python 2 was replaced by Python 3 some 6 years ago, I'm dismayed to see that this class is teaching Python 2 instead of Python 3.",1
From the start it seemed politically correct and ideological. Did not even broach the topic until the final week (as far as I can see from the list of videos). Life is too short.,1
"There is no instruction with this course. If you've never written a script before you're not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself, which you can do without this course. Not to mention, the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful. For example. if i've never written a script, what value am I to someone else who has also never written a script. And what value is their feedback to me. I signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than I. I'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us. To pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless. There's no value in that. What does the instructor think??? Would HE pass us? He occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.I think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students. Joke's on anyone paying $49 to essentially teach yourself. This guys just sits back and ""moderates"" when he can.The best thing about this class is that it does force you to write, but beyond that, it's not helpful at all. Truly disappointing.",1
Very poor that in order to submit any exam I have to purchase the course when I can download the book and learn as well.,1
"Excellent lectures, good tests, too many peer evaluations!",1
"Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate. So I went through all the open sites which were extremely disappointing. Since I was warned by the reviews, I was not even tempted to pay to unlock further pages. I attended many interesting courses on Coursera, but this one is simply a waste of time from the very first moment.",1
"The course has a fundamental problem, it relies completely on a library developed by one of the instructors, which is not open source. In the end, it seems like a big opportunity of delivering a marketing campaign by the instructors then otherwise.I definitely will not spend time and money on the other courses of this specialization.",1
"$450 for this course and they can't even bother to make sure that the quizzes are scored correctly? Two weeks back to back and one question each week has been counted wrong when answered correctly. That, paired with the fact that your only method to have an assignment graded is via peer review means that I'll be suggesting peers save their money on this course. It's entirely possible that you could be stranded with no one to grade your work - Coursera's suggestion if this should occur is that you should beg on the forums - or transfer your work to a later session of the same course. Good content, awful policies intended to allow the platform to be hands-off for Coursera - that's unacceptable at this price.",1
"Professor speaks too slowly most of the time but then quickly glosses over complicated equations without much explanation of what the equation is or what the variables are or labeling the equations (he has multiple equations on one slide when talking). Some videos are 2 minutes, some are 11 minutes. Quizzes are exceedingly simple - 10 questions with only two possible answers each. 100% of the time, there is at least 1 question with the wrong answer. There have been no TAs to help answer questions or to rectify these wrong answers. All the while, Coursera keeps asking if I want to pay $45 to verify for this course. Ha!! You have to be joking. This class was disappointing. You'd almost be better off reading Wikipedia articles or a book.",1
"Neo-liberal and neo-con presentation of the matter that has little to do with how the real world works, or should work, had we had a fair play field. Would not expect anything else from the neo-liberal flagman, Yale. Pretty much expected it would be the case, but just wanted to give it a try.",1
"Hard to understand professor. When one needs to read the english subtitles to understand the english the professor is speaking, it becomes inherently difficult in an online course. Also, please kill the intro video for each course. It is completely unnecessary as the courses are labeled on the left side of the screen. Good material, but difficult to watch towards the end of the course.",1
10/10 would program again,1
Submission is buggy and final assignment is confusing. Almost more than half of students failed this course because of it.,1
"Too base for experienced people, not enough fundamental for beginners.After 2 weeks didn't find any useful information, it also very boring, so recommend to see video on 1.25 -1.5 speed.The course need to be significantly changed:1. Who are the target audience2. How many resources do we have (time etc)3. What we would see as a result of course (knowledge, skills (hard, soft)etc.",1
"The peer reviewed assignments are next to useless, as there is no oversight on them. I think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first, before allowing fellow learners the ability to pass/fail students in the course.",1
doesn't show the videos.,1
"No teaching. Just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary students' hypothetical thoughts. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.",1
The use of external tool for no good reason + the lack of written summary makes the course really hard to follow.,1
"The course is very useless, there is no meat, only water - there is no substance - only talking around the topic. I am appalled that such research exists, and ashamed for the coursera",1
Way too many errors in the graded assignment. Non-reponsive teaching assistants.,1
"Just read the slide., The presentations add very little since the presenter is (stumbling) over just reading the text on the slides.",1
Very slow.,1
"A lot of theoretical stuff, nothing for practice; awful final exam strategy, the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking; advice: to help non english students (like me), make the lectures not overlapping the subtitles",1
The design of this course seems rather lazy. There should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the videos.,1
"It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.The very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for 5-year-olds and ineffective lecture videos with little or no eye contact with the instructors. The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.After watching videos, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero. Sometimes I had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make. Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them. But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into. Always with 100% final grade.The overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be. I recommend the designers to watch ""Write Professional Emails"" with Gerry Landers by Georgia Tech and ""Teach English Now!"" with Dr. Shane Dixon by Arizona State University. I do not normally remember the instructors' names, except for brilliant ones. I do not remember the ones of this course.I do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students. I apologize if I was overly direct and wordy.Regards,Rafael",1
water on the mill,1
Really confusing and struggled a lot. The course doesn't prepare you for the final project.,1
"Mostly fluff with little substance. The videos seemed loosely tied around a common subject, but it might as well have been a YouTube playlist on overall concepts of cities needing to be aware of climate change. The week 4 videos were the same as the week 1 with very vague statements about cities needing to experiment with sustainability to approach the challenges of the 21st century. Only the week 2 video on Copenhagen was actually educational beyond the most superficial concepts.",1
"The title of this class should have read ""Programming for Anybody that already knew a decent amount about basic Programming(Continuing with Python)""",1
"There are better (Free!) courses out there to learn basic inferential statistics. Khan Academy is a great place to start, and Udacity has a great class that gives a good intuitive understanding. The main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire Data Science program. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an intro stats class. The instructor clearly knows the material, the class just does not do a good job of transfering that knowledge.",1
"At first the presentations are really on a semi professional level (copy & paste codes, making errors without knowing the cause). They show a lot what can be done with swift but the never show/mention what it's really usefull for (no ""real life"" usage just snippets after snippets).To few practical doings (mostly only quiz stuff)",1
The course is very boring and monotonous. It should be made more engaging. One needs to capture the concentration of students for a subject like Angular.,1
poor teacher..,1
"Sadly, there only english subtitles in the first video, so I can´t continue the course",1
"This course is too much doggy! Please do not use Coursera for advertising your friends´companies, or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant! This psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits. Looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism. It is really shameful.",1
"The videos are long and not engaging enough. Rather than digital marketing concepts, this was more an application of trends to traditional marketing concepts. Some of the topics are already outdated and some assignments were more applicable to those residing in the U.S. or are not exactly feasible to do at this point.",1
amazing! Thanks a lot,1
"This is 3rd time I a trying this course. Labeling someone just reading the slides out loud as a course is ridiculous. I have to express that this is horrible, Please don't callout a course. Call it Audio Slides.I have a Master's degree in engineering and have won scholarship all my life. This is the first time I am trying out on-line course. The courses were okay till I came to this sections mostly done by Brian Jaffe. Knowing and teaching is two different things, Brian! I will continue, with help from other materials outside the course. But I have ti rate this as 1 star.",1
"Took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately. I'm wondering if I can get my money back.",1
"Extremely light on information, no discussion forums.",1
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
The course is very difficult to comprehend..Moreover the examplanations given ar not concise and brief..,1
It does not worth a penny to spend time in this course.,1
"This course is clearly signposted as being supported by the Templeton Foundation and it shows. The course is short in terms of length and weak in the terms of developing ideas. The designers do not seem to understand properly what science is and what scientists do. This is particularly evident in the final week, an incoherent ramble. The course strengthens my positive opinions of Feynman's view of the philosophy of science.In general. I enjoy Edinburgh University's Coursera courses, but I shall be wary of any of a similar ilk and certainly won't buy the certificate this time.",1
The course does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.,1
Assighnment is partly possible only with classmate who has full knowledge of python!,1
"Although the content is correct, quality models videos and materials is very low, wanted to make all the specialization, but I'm not satisfied with the quality of the course. It's a shame, because the JHU is an excellent University",1
just a collection of materials you'd find in any museum..,1
"So many powerpoint slides.. It's very boring course. The tutor just read slides without deep explanations, wikipedia much more interesting. It's just observing course, theoretical 95%.",1
boring,1
"The lessons on presentation skills and traditional media should have taken just one one or two minutes, and one or two slides, at most. The details and time invested really had little to do with digital marketing or the digital landscape. The use of the hand-written pros and cons was an unnecessary novelty. Regular bullet text are more readable and technically more reliable. Most of all, the presenter's style was distracting. It seemed that she was unsure of her subject matter and script. I recommend re-scripting and rehearsing the presentation -- before re-shooting it. Finally, with the rapid pace of change in digital, we should not be using reading material more than two or three years old. Five years is tantamount to a generation in the digital world.",1
"This was very disappointing, especially considering it's a Wharton product. The ""course"" was little more than an afternoon's worth of seminars. Since I am not a paying participant, I could not take the quizzes, so I finished watching the videos in less than a day.In addition, there are NO collateral or supporting materials provided. None of the spreadsheets or workbooks illustrated in the videos are available anywhere on the course site, despite their being advertised in the videos. All in all, it was consistent with the first course in this ""specialization"".Again, very disappointing. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this.",1
"The content was VERY scarce, and it was obvously prepared in a hurry. This course just touches very superficially the subject to be studied. Not meeting minimum quality standards.",1
worst course forever,1
"Too short, too easy, too costly. Beautiful picture, beautiful title, but low content.",1
"Although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge, that statement isn't accurate. You will quickly become lost in the assignments and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material. The instruction from Mr Peng is all over the place and doesn't give you a good understanding of the language. I found SWIRL to be 100% more helpful. But looking at the upcoming materials, you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization. Which SHOULD have been told to students prior to them spending money on the course. I would NOT recommend this course to anyone.",1
"don't waste your time, just touch supper surface about this technologies, most time just mention the name of these technologies",1
"difficulf...very difficult, guys",1
"I would not recommend this one to any paying customer. This is the second intro to Graphic Design class I have take on Coursera, and I found the way the material was presented in the CalArts course to be quite slow and pretty boring. Our assignments were simple and I felt no excitement in doing them. It would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building blocks could be used in real life design. The other class (by CU-Boulder) made me want to continue learning ,and I felt excited to complete the projects whereas with this class I was forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required ones.",1
"I was incredibly excited to start this course. The outline looks amazing. For learning mediums like this, you have to start strong. Keep up the great work, you all look like you know what you're doing. You should certainly put some polish on all these videos. It's near impossible to follow along. I'd be curious in seeing the data on how many of your students finish this course.",1
The fact that the class uses GraphLab instead of pandas/numpy/sklearn should have been stated up frontThe course felt like an advertisement for the professor's toolkitIt was very disappointing that the equivalent standard workflow was not supported,1
All very basic.,1
Sorry but this is awful. Literally just reading from some very high level slides no dept to the course. I cannot recommend this course in its current state.,1
"This was the most arduous undertaking I have ever been through. My frustration is not with professor Wobbrock, who is obviously an expert in his field (though sometimes I felt like he's speaking in ""High Valyrian"" and not English). My disappointment lies with UCSD which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding R, without much thought on whether students will be able to follow. I feel that going through this course was largely pointless, because I'm not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run.Based solely on this experience, I'm NOT going to be recommending this specialization to anyone.",1
"For someone who is not familiar with inferential statistics, this course is too compact. I lost the overall picture: it seems that a dozend methods were introduced, but I failed to understand under which preconditions each method is deployable. I am confused.",1
"This course really doesn't offer anything substantial in a practical sense. It has the feel of some sort of odd ""New Age"" repackaging of things already obvious to anyone with even a modicum of leadership ability. This is the first Coursera course that I have ever wanted to rate zero stars.",1
I felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses. One separate course for this topic is a waste of money.,1
"If you plan to purchase this course, enjoy, but the course isn't really free.You can watch the lectures, but you must pay to unlock the python playground. There's no real point to the course if you can't test your knowledge.",1
"Presenter is very bad lecturer. She seems to be reading (badly) from a tele prompt, rather than lecturing. The quality of the slides is very poor. Not the level of a reputable University.",1
No use at all,1
"No accurate help, no feedback on the graders, 2 out of 3 assignments where not specified correctly, or just wrong... this course will only teach you to be frustrated.",1
Hard and dry,1
Unable to even start it... Click on videos of week 1 and nothing happens,1
"i hate to say it, but this course is really really bad ... not practical at all. i'm not sure where this is all going. maybe by the fourth course in the series, 100 hours later of lectures, you might have something practical but this approach feels wrong. i'm sorry, it's a reputable school and who the hell am I, but one man's opinion: rethink how you go about introducing the newbie to graphic design as it's applicable to the real world.",1
This course is basically about watching uninspiring videos. It needs a lot of design thinking itself.I have bought the book however. It is really useful.,1
"I wouldn't never recommend this course. The teacher gives you all inforation without normal explan. You have chanse to understand HTML and CSS, but Js . JS leguage need more deteils, exemples and explaining, who I didn't find in this course. The first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher. I took the next series of course coz I saw that there are other tacher",1
"Not good at all.We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization.",1
Course was taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security. They read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience. Very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said.,1
Only one star as it was not made clear you could also get 1/5 points in assignments noted as ties but no further explanation. I don't think I will bother with part 2,1
"Basing on the first videos, I would not recommend this course to anyone believing that ""You are expected have basic computer literacy skills, such as knowing how to send & receive emails and browse the web"".The lector is robotic, the slides look outdated, listener is bored after 10 min of watching. I definitely WOULD NOT pay for this course.I will change the rate after I watch more videos, but this course is a big no-no for me.",1
"The quiz feedbacks are empty, this is not good.",1
"Totally disorganized, mis-managed, unfairly graded course!",1
Test questions for week 3 are incorrect and do not match video / reading. Had to go to YouTube to figure out most of it.,1
"This capstone project is a bad joke and I'm gonna tell you why!First, ESSEC TAs were never available! We had to contact Coursera several times for weeks to get a simple yet not helpful reply from ESSEC. And it was too late for anything, really... Remember, the whole project lasts for 4 weeks only!Second, several documents required for the weekly assignments were missing! It's fair to say we were all free-styling (i.e. making wild assumptions) our ways through the entire capstone due to lack of necessary information.Third (and most importantly). most of the participants didn't have any basic business background whatsoever. Be prepared to get a bad grade from someone who's clueless about hotel business, not to mention revenue or demand management. That really makes you wonder how these people even passed the last three core courses....Forth, this capstone is great for those who just want to get a certificate for the sake of having a certificate. Did you notice those 4 or 5 star ratings with no written reviews? Yeah, they were probably trying to show their appreciation for the easy certificate. After all, it's easy to walk away with a decent grade when there's no one knows what's going on. ANYTHING GOES! However, if you are a serious learner who wants to actually learn something, run away from this capstone. You will be thanking me later.All in all, a horrible experience and I wish I could get those 4 weeks of my life back!",1
The professor is just reading the text. Not really a good example of interactive e-learning content.,1
"Really bad course. They don't explain the concepts clearly, the quizzes ambiguously ask things not seen in the videos and the instructor introduces equations without further explanation. The course Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots (edX) is much better.",1
The teachers and instructors really should make better videos and stop giving peer edit assignment when people are picky and do not grade your assignment. The instructors should also give their contacts to let their students contact them when the discussion forums dont work,1
A collection of links to other sites and short and highly generic videos,1
"This course is poorly designed. What course on a programming language jumps first into how to use the debugger and what went wrong with a program? You are not introducing Swift, you are introducing xcode (and doing a terrible job of it). Also, I have been using xcode and Swift for 8 months now and producing some really good work, but I could only get 3/7 on your quiz because you have written questions with the purpose of tricking people instead of reinforcing or checking knowledge of the content.When you teach a new application, consider introducing the interface first. Explain what the various areas are, what they are needed for, and how to control them. This orients the user in the application and helps them to find their way around when they are trying to reinforce your teachings later.The presentation for this course is so unprofessional. It's like a running commentary on a movie instead of an educational presentation. I felt like I was listening to two geeks stuffing around and having a good time, instead of people who are professional teachers!I'm so incredibly disappointed with this course. Back to the wonderful work of Paul Hegarty from Stanford University on iTunes University and YouTube for me.University of Toronto - you should really consider what your teaching staff are doing before you unleash them on the world.",1
Quiz should be open to all students... :/,1
"Hi,I'm sorry to say that this course wasn't really useful. I had the impression to see dozens of INTRODUCTION videos about sustainables cities. Because:1. In 5 weeks you have time to cover in details all the aspects of sustainable cities: energy, transport, waste, building, sharing economy. The condition is to focus each week to a topic.2. It is too much based on powerpoint presentation and not at all on example. Concepts stay concepts: we didn't visit one single town, a connected building, an innovative waste management system. You quote 300 living labs, let's go !3. Pictures from the powerpoint are at least for half of them taken from pictures bank. Synthetic images, not concrete. Desapointing.4.. Always the same example: Malmo, Copenhagen... What about the rest of the world ?5. Videos from WWH and ICLEI are clearly revolting. Is it some publicity for them ??? This is not the place for that.In contrast, congratulations to Yuliya Voytenko, for her speech about sharing economy: it was clear, precise, focused.Please do your best to improve your courses: you have the knowledge, let's spread it.",1
"This course is very inconsistent when it comes to JavaScript. Instead of giving fundamentals of the language, course instructors prefer to give you a bunch of non-standard libraries and teach you a couple of randomly selected methods which could be applied to images. All core concepts such as data types, data structures are explained very sketchy. OOP paradigm isn;t explained at all. For example, they give you a line of code which goes something like:var x = new SimpleImage(""..."");no explanation of what SimpleImage is is given neither you are taught how exactly it works. Apparently, this course relies heavily on self-learning the lib docs given on their site.All together this leads you to simply monkey-coping lecture materials into code editor without even realising how it works and what it does. This course is at best serve observatory purpose to give student just a peek at what web development is like.This course could not be used as a solid foundation fow specialization.",1
"Covers basic statistics (Mean, Variance, Simple Z and T tests). Not what I was expecting as Inference. Multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided, not adjusted for. Bootstrapping is not a new idea and has been used in other fields.",1
"This is a course for students with little or no work experience. I've been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information, but the quizes aren't designed for experienced adult learners. Not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning. Given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course, I expected more value for my precious time. This week I decided the value isn't there. I might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults.",1
"I don't understand how come this course can get such high reviews. My experience with this course is horrible. First of all, most quiz are poorly designed, lots of mistakes. For instance, there are 10 Qs in week 1, 3 of them have mistakes. Wasted me tons of times.Lectures are also difficult to follow. Instructors usually just give formulas without further explanation. I forced myself to go through them until week 4, I finally give it up. I feel like it is a waste of my time. I need to find a better course on this topic.Most coursera courses are very well designed. This one is the worst I have ever experienced.",1
I did not know what was going on and I have to stop.,1
"Terrible instruction in the videos and unclear directions. I'd avoid this course if possible, but it's required for the specialization. New videos should be shot and inspiration taken from more instructive and interesting guides, like The Cartoon Guide to Statistics by Gonick & Smith.",1
"The only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization, though it may make you reconsider continuing with it. The instructor and provided materials fail to adequately explain the concepts this course is supposed to cover, and do not prepare students for the quizzes or assignments. If you don't know statistics you won't learn it here. If you know statistics, you don't need this course.",1
"Outdated material, nightmare to submit assignments. Badly needs to be updated.",1
"The pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction. Large gaps exist: explanations of syntax and conceptualization of how the data flows seem incomplete. I have looked at all kinds of documentation as well as the book, but I cannot find what I need to know, and this a barrier to completing the assignments. The instructor's videos have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts. The examples show at most 20% (that is just a guess, it is probably less) of the knowledge that I need to complete the assignments. When I ask questions on the forums, the first word I think when I read mentors' explanations is ""cryptic.""",1
"Wordy, dirge like. The topic is interesting but the exposition is so boring - the reading of a lecture outline - that I'd rather study on my own 8-(",1
"I have completed two other Coursera courses for certificates, where I learned much more. The quantity and quality of the content - both video's and reading materials - is significantly lower than that of the other courses, where I really had to take notes and read much more. The assignments are way to general and do not require much preparation, which hardly makes them serious learning exercises. Frankly, I could have done some interviews and research online and make a a course like this myself...",1
"probably a very interesting course, but the way of teaching looks very indigestible... no video and no real explanation or examples.",1
"This is definitely a course for someone that has finished a higher degree. if you've done that, there's a very big change that you already know about 90%-95% of the techniques presented in thous course.",1
it so boring,1
This is not for beginners at all.,1
"Really disappointing course. Content is shallow, despite the impressive credentials of the Professor. Quizzes are ridiculously easy.",1
It is so basic and simple.,1
"Despite being someone with spoken Mandarin ability, I have decided to stop taking this course due to the new vocabulary not being explicitly described or explained in much detail. The basic grammar is also skipped over in explanation.",1
"This is not a course for beginners, even though you go through all previous the courses.There is no interaction at all with the professors or tutors.The Projects are evaluated by your own Classmates.",1
Too much talking in a lot of these course offerings. I have ADD and I cannot take excessive talking.,1
Does not include latest developments in this industry,1
A new generation of MOOC with REL available for free on the web as teaching ressources!Already got that elsewhere...,1
Hands-on instructions and a very practical knowledge. Thanks!,1
I was not aible to complete this course for free. That was very disappointing! Universities like Stanford and John Hopkins find the opportunity to offer similar courses free of charge to peoople who want to learn. From University of Washington I have expected the same. Your bad!Best regardsKonstantin,1
"The title is very misleading. Excel is an afterthought for this course; instead there is a heavy focus on statistics. The class claims to be for beginners, but that is clearly not the case, as it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistics and calculus.Excel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus; there are weeks where Excel is not used at all. There are no practice assignments, only quizzes.It's clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained, as the videos refer to examples that are not included or content that was not presented.Needless to say, I will not be taking any other courses in this specialization.",1
"Language is not good, and Lack of Info",1
homework was poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture videos. Had to dig through several buried links to make any progress on the homework assignments.,1
This course hardly has any new content and a lot of it is also repeat from previous courses.,1
"Poor grading system. Based on 2 peers' ""subjective"" points of your week4 analysis assignment, even if you digested all the materials and received 100% on quizzes all weeks, you will have to repeat taking this course endlessly. At first I thought I did not analyze thoroughly so on my second session, I basically rewrote the whole assessment, followed by samples passed students gave me, also making sure I covered all the points the instruction asked me to cover, peer gives me 1 or 1.5 point for writing persona with little detail. I wrote 350 words persona, with stories and demographic of my target audience. Because I am 2.5 points short or so, I have to take this same course for the next round session for the third time, wait it it reaches week 4, resubmit my analysis that is now edited for 4 times. There is no clear guideline, format, or even sample provided, but the grades are left to the peers. Some pass with less than 300 word analysis with a lot of charts and pictures. I did as well but wasn't lucky at my first round so I developed 3 pg. analysis all in words to make it look like a true analytical report, didn't pass again. I do not know what this instructor is looking for as a form of assessment/analysis paper, and only those who are lucky enough to meet sensible peer graders pass. Waste of time, waste of money no one wants to spend lifetime to get a certificate especially when one knows what he or she is talking about.",1
The gobbledygook mooc. Worst bunch of talking a lot and saying nothing I ever encountered.,1
Poorly designed and explained. You do not really gain much knowledge from this course.I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course. There are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices.,1
The instructor is very bad. She made the lectures so boring with her lack of preparation that I switched to just reading the transcript. The assignments were lacking in case studies and were very textbooky. I could have skipped this course and simply read from the E-book. Tried to get a refund but its too late so I will have to force through this one and the next. I hope it doesn't adversely affected my grades as I have scored above 96% in the previous 3 courses in this specialisation. Very disappointed and frustrated. I came to Coursera to avoid teachers and teaching styles like this. This really shakes my confidence in Coursera for future courses. Im definitely not going to pay for any courses in the future.,1
It is too basic,1
"After finishing week 1, I have decided to stick with Duke university's Medical neuroscience which is starting up again. I also highly recommend ""Understanding the Brain The Neurobiology of Everyday Life"" which I believe was taught by the University of Chicago. I found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow. I found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switches.It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this course. It also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and I do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an English translation on them.",1
"The final assignment is impossible to finish since I have 10.4 version in my computer. You, as the course provider, should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make changes. The point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge, not wasting time on solving those bugs.",1
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
"Important material, poorly taught.",1
"The instructor might be a good web developer, but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser. Unfortunately, that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading Final Projects.Unless you are ready to suffer through several hours of tearing your hair out because their parser does not accept perfectly written code, don't take this course. The only thing you'll learn through the experience is that some people should stay as far away from writing autograders as the planet would allow them.Additionally, the information presented in this course is available in several better structured and presented versions both on Coursera and other MOOC platforms. So you don't need this course in particular in order to learn the material.",1
The weakest of the series so far. Overlap with some of the other courses. Too much art therapy.,1
"Paid for the course and never took it. Terrible professor teaching the course, the format was poorly put together, and just wasn't overall a very good course.",1
This has ruined my life.,1
"The videos for this course seemed to be 30% recap of the prior lesson, and 20% restatement of what was learned. Some even duplicated their own content in the restatement. The material covered was simply running through each of the menus in Tableau. Again, this material may be of use, but would be better as a primer for the class rather than presented as useful, paid content. Terribly disappointed.",1
Not good- weak lecturer- repeats himself endlessly- waste of time,1
"The lectures and assignments dealing with Ionic were useful and informative, but that's only the first half of the course. The Android/iOS portion felt extremely rushed. For all of the hassle of setting up my Android environment, I get one week of lectures/exercises out of it and that only covers rudimentary functionality.",1
Please stay away from this course.,1
Way too elementary.,1
"The material/information required for the capstone was not covered in the lectures and required considerable additional time and effort to find via online forums and the galaxy pages themselves. A manual of code examples and types of jobs would have been great. Further a better use of time would be to start doing the capstone on day 1 and do all of the lectures and quizzes later as the quizzes were very easy and anecdotal, but the capstone required more time then scheduled in the course.",1
"Too dull, no programming explanations. Sometimes too simple and suddenly too technical.",1
"The reason why I gave one star is because I don't think its content is completely related to its title. This course is very similar to music production but using only pro tools.If you are looking to learn more about music production using pro tools, then this is an awesome course but if you already have some background in music production and you just want to learn pro tools basics, then I don't think this is an appropriate course (in my opinion).",1
Boring Professor,1
Bad one. Most of the time he was only giving what is their in the course Mooc 1 2 3etc etc. Irritated,1
"very bad, useless course. Just listing the names of the methods and practices.",1
In wk3 my DB is totally messed up and I do not know where to find the CORRECT create statements to recreate the DB that the assignments expect! It shouldn't be too difficult to provide one page that gives the commands to execute to create the DB that is used in each week (for each week separately). Due to that I'm un-enrolling from this course.,1
"No content, essentially you just read a textbook. The videos are about 5 minutes per week.",1
"Well, first thing I am going to say this is not going to be looking good, however correct me if I got anything wrong or being unfair.To be honest, I am very frustrated with this course! It is a very good topic that I am very interested and that's the reason I am enrolled , but the support and the structure of it is very disappointing!Example like this(https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/0kwIpLJDEeawPhIF4bjuNg), question is not even specified and waste me so much time looking for the requirement and post discussion board and wait hopefully somebody is going to reply!Same for the ScimEn file , which again the file name was not specified in the question!From last secession, assignment two have lots of confusing around what exactly the question is asking about and again lots of time being wasted just to figure out the question!The support is poor as well, not like other course , I would usually get a answer within the same day , but this one is really when you are lucky! Plus the staff rarely response!In short, I hope the staff of the course would see this. This is a good topic but the course are poorly designed with very limited support!I mean if you are truly love the topic , you should pass on the passion to your students and design the course that students not only learn the material in the course but also can know how to ask questions and find out the questions themselves ,but first like learning any skills students needs to ask lots of questions ! I am not going to mention that ,coz even the question in the course is full of error !!Unless, the whole purpose is to make some money , then it make sense , however if it is that case , I am not going to enrol in this course any more.",1
"This course is not well moderated, the material is confusing, and the quizzes were not tested before uploading them onto Coursera. This specialization is definitely not on par with other specializations I have done.BLUF: There are better uses for your money and time.",1
Not happy with this course.,1
"Perhaps it's just that I'm not a part of the target audience of this course, but I am deeply dissatisfied with it. Aside from a couple of rare interviews and old video records [which admittedly were very interesting, though too few], I found nothing of value that cannot be learned by reading Wikipedia or other easily accessible sources. The course is pretty light on technical details and there could [and perhaps should] have been much more beyond-the-scenes content, as well as references to specific documents and events in order to justify this course's existence.In other words, if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic, chances are that you already know most of the material taught.",1
horrible,1
"The first segment on why ""Digital Changes Everything"" is good background but the rest was too abstract for me with nothing I could really take away and practice.",1
"No Open Source Libraries, this course is not educational; it is a sales pitch to use their expensive software. Good luck having an employer pay this amount of money for software when they can hire employees that can use free open source libraries.",1
"Much trivial content, but advertised as an expert course. Further, the assignments did not work properly at the beginning and there is no timely response of staff. I would not waste money on that course again and will probably try to get refund in time.",1
boring and helpless,1
"Very bad course too fast is not an introduction more like a remember of things, this course try to covers too much information in 3 weeks and the assigments are not well guided and messy",1
"The support from the faculty and the website is beyond explainable bad. The user interface gets stuck without reasons. There is no direct way to contact the faculty, if you are stuck on any assignments. There is hardly anyone who responds to the feedback that is sought for!!I will never recommend someone to do this course.",1
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).,1
the class gave me nothing. nobody wan's to waste tons of hours to learn nothing. so I personally think this course is on of the worst classes among the Coursera.,1
The gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous. So much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of R programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignments. Incredibly disappointing!,1
"Sorry, the guy in the first video doesn't blink, which is very weird. The second video was so incredibly dry and boring that I completely lost interest. I know this could be a fascinating course with the proper videos and visuals to help people understand it.",1
"the weekly quiz are premium only now? well now i don't need to review other's work, since calification is already broken, so ty. Just close the free enroll already, make ppl life easy. I have to say goodbye Rice now.ps: worse part is i really enjoyed the last time i was here. Now i feel an asshole for believing on this shit.",1
Lacks of subtitles. Very disappointed,1
"Well, this course definetely has a clear message and a good purpose. However, it is very basic and coursera might not the right platform.",1
"This course is not even considered as an introduction it's a complementary for those whose career is robotics , in other words the required prerequisites are more than matlab programming skills and some calculus and algebra, its assignments have many problems that cannot be solved using just the course studying.the course doesn't give many information.",1
"Very disappointed with the information provided. I went through the second week, completing all assignments and quizzes, but did not learn anything new. Most of the information provided is common knowledge anymore. I was also a little put off by the frequent self promotions by the instructor, in reference to his treatment center, organizations and book. I am withdrawing from the class.",1
Completely disppointing.,1
Title misleading. Never ever a beginners course.,1
"I didn't like the class despite getting 100% on pretty much every assignment. I learned very little from the class. I don't think 99% of what was in the class was useful to me at all. The grading for the class had ludonarrative dissonance with the quizzes. The projects were graded by peers, but the rubric was nonsensical. 1-5 scale for submitting a PDF, for example. So, someone might give you a 1 for submitting the PDF and thus you wouldn't get a full-score. It was just idiotic.",1
"Please avoid to take this course! Lessons seems to be, at least, not prepared by the teachers.",1
"Really frustrating method of teaching. Class is incredibly slow and does way, way too much simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication to prove extremely basic points for a calculus course.",1
Such a boring class,1
Too much mathematic approach,1
"It's good introduction, but the assignment are rather poor. Not worth paying for it",1
I think it could be funnier...,1
I really wanted to learn this stuff. I have almost no background in statistics. But the lectures didn't cover stuff with enough rigor and repetition for me to pick up much.So I pretty much gamed the quizzes and project enough to get through the class. Rather disappointing.,1
"Too advanced, not enough Excel",1
"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1
it's a shame to split a one month course to four.,1
Bad audio qualityPoor presentationNot for professional developers (perhaps can be fine for beginners),1
It is impossible to submit quizes and programming assignments without purchasing the course. In my view this defies the goal of Coursera to provide accessible education anywhere in the world!,1
Really excellent materials and links but spoiled by typos on the videos and in the quiz questions. I'm sure some of the quiz answers conflicted with what had been said in the videos.,1
This course is not good in giving lessons with examples that will help a with studying for the quizzes.,1
"Poorly coordinated lectures. References to resources that are not provided. No response (at least, for days on end) when questions are posted on the forums",1
Little to no use for me. Should not be included in the specialization... I didn't sign up for a data class...,1
"The course is misleading - the difficulty ramps up too quickly, with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up. It should be toned down and reworked, or split into two courses. Cramming everything into 4 weeks makes everything too difficult.",1
"Teachers poorly prepared, explanations ambiguous, it seems that they didn't pay attention to examples and sound of the course.I love Jack Wu written tutorials... way better than videos.",1
Too difficult to learn for beginners.,1
"Poorly organized and managed. Each week of this course should have been broken down into individual 4 week courses. I have 20 years software development experience, and I can tell you this is too much information to cram into a single class.",1
"I was really disappointed with this course. I took the other courses from Brian Caffo and truly enjoyed them. For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material. There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess. It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look. There is a bunch of wrong code and typos. The explanation doesn't go as far as it should. I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course. I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others. If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it. Try learning Regression Models elsewhere.",1
This course is,1
"The teacher lacks the ability of mathematical description, including clearing defining concepts, describing everything in mathematical languages, and showing math formulas of t-tests. She hopes to hide everything behind the canvas and just show how statistics are applied. But without enough mathematics nothing she said makes sense. I have to search on the internet to get to know what she didn't teach.------from a math phd.",1
I only took this Course because I was forced too and I don't think it matters what you eat it's just how much you eat. You also don't need to eat lots of Vegetables and Fruit to be a Health person just saying .Plus this course is boring as hell,1
"Very interesting, but I was really hoping more. For example, the professor does not teah us directly, like all the other courses on Coursera. It is only texts and archive videos.....Youtube would have done the same. Disappointed.",1
"The cloud computing service with amazon described in the course is not free anymore. I was charged money for using it. The course also took much more time to complete than I wanted to spend. I believe a better design of the project could lead to a more efficient, less frustrating learning experience. Details below.The usegalaxy server was extremely slow. As shown in the course, I installed an instance of galaxy in the AWS/Amazon Cloud. I was under the impression that this was a free service for the first year. Amazon has changed its interfaces and I could not do the installation as recommended. But I managed to run a few analyses with some workarounds. I did not explicitely terminated the galaxy instance for ~ 6 days. Charges of $280 accumulated.The course project in week 4 was far beyond what was covered in the lectures. It took me a whole week, spending multiple hours every day. Many dead-end roads coupled with extremely long run times on the galaxy servers resulted in very inefficient learning and many frustrations. Help via the discussion forum was critical to design an analysis pipeline - so thank you Dejan and all contributors for the support.This is not a course I could easily do part-time: I don’t have time to read the fine print on what is available for free on Amazon, nor do I have time to go through all of the tools on galaxy to find out what would be the best for my analysis.On the positive side: I think Galaxy is a great tool.",1
Poor alignment between assignments and lectures. Lots of content poorly explained.,1
"the instructor voice are so calm , so i cannot concentrate well",1
"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review.They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing.",1
"waste of time. except for git and github ,nothing much is in it.",1
The introduction is great. After that it's unbearably boring.,1
"It absolutely amazing course , I personally benefit a lot. really it's not just the certificate .Thank you Coursera for this huge chance.",1
i dont know why quizzes are locked even though I'm enrolled in this course and already done watching all videos in it.,1
It does not touch Hash table or Stack. Just the common data type in python.,1
"Unclear, ambiguous direction and material that is unhelpful for building the final project",1
I just started the course and I'm going to stop this course right away. In my opinion showing Hitler as an appropriate leader is not the course I want to visit! I do not upport any racist mindset.,1

not very well organized.,1
Too abstract and unroganized,1

Absolutely poor. Avoid. No professor monitoring of the fo,1
"Warning: The lecture videos along will NOT be enough to prepare you for the final assignment! Be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials. On the forum, many students said they had to drop out during the last week (probably without getting a refund!) because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment. If you are determined to get the specialization certificate, you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible. Don't wait until the last week or two!!",1
I can't start this course,1
"Many videos lacked associated pdf slides so confusing to watch. Some topics on slides were not covered in videos. A supplemental video for those would be great even of optional.Brian Cato is a good presenter, however, more examples needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problems both by traditional method and using R.",1
"If you do not already know java (or at least have some experience with it) I would NOT recommend this class. They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level. Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics. They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together. There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.The assignments are also a bit of a mess. All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method. You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things. Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect.",1
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
"Mr Roth is woefully unprepared for this course, his assessments of the several artists and thinkers he explores are deeply and distressingly flawed - and why would he repeat in a classroom, with unbecoming histrionics, the same lesson he's just delivered from his office",1
The course requires good knowledge of statistics as a pre-requisite.,1
"The course is too complicated. Also this programm isnt working as good as it should. I got so many failures, which I had to look for by myself. Also it isnt well explained! I almost didnt understand anything! Also some data persons, i knew, didn't understand that either. They never worked with something like that!",1
"The content of the course looked promising. But then I took a first look: the instructor is reading formulas from a slide. This is missing the whole point of a online class. There is no motivation for the formulars, no context why they are important. And from a learning point of view the course is very hard to follow. No real advantage compared to reading a book on that matter.I just took the ""Economics of Money and Banking course"", which is one of the best courses I ever attended (personally in class or online). There are other great courses on Coursera. And for easy introduction to some of the concepts Khan University courses are unmatched in accessability.Too bad that this course doesn't match up to the above examples. The topics would deserve that they are presented in a way that they can be understood by a wide audience.",1
There is a lot of material in this course that has not been explained,1
"It is not free. They just sell the certificates. There is not any free statement about accomplishment of the course, so nobody will knows that you have completed it. In the future you have not got anything to show in your CV.I want my Statement of Accomplishment.",1
"Such lame quizes, I cannot pass them although I know this material in my sleep,because the english is so bad and has so many ambiguities; There are no single answers to a question, instead you need the check the correct answers, which are phrased in s misleading way, and one little mistake fails the whole question. So I try and try and try and never get all the correct checks for the specific questions. So I just fail and retry and fail and retry. This is so frustrating I consider I will unroll this course. Same because I know all this material !!!!",1
"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question",1
Useless. The information content is close to zero. Just some blah-blah and a long tutorial to install software.,1
The course appears unfinished and very disorganized. The lectures are monotonous and boring.,1
"Low on actionable content. Was looking for some specific tactics to use, but even though the course syllabus refers to tactical information on influencing people, it lacked any specificity to make it useful.",1
There is a huge disconnect between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignments.,1
"Sorry but the variable ""peer"" reviews ruined this course for me, I either did not get enough reviews or a ""prankster"" would down mark for whatever reason they had in their head at that particular moment. the staff don't seem interested in this a a problem. and there is no way to rate a bad reviewer so they get away with it.the other courses in the specialisation are great, but this one gives very little in the way of tuition and relies on the whole on peers, which for me didn't work out too well",1
I did like this course however it is very very basic. I think it should have been merged with course 2 as the course contents are as good as one week work.,1
The instructor is about as convoluted as you can possibly get with his explanations.,1
"Story telling module, not really useful for IOT purpose.",1
"Boring, didn't have strength to finish",1
"Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating, not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing.",1
"Personally, I feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject. This course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background.",1
Teaching should really be improved.,1
Not very practical.,1
"This class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series. So much statistical terminology and jargon was used by the instructor, it felt like taking a class in another language where I had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used. It took a lot of grit to finish the class, which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience.",1
I personally did not find it constructive enough to spend money on.It is way too general and basic. I expected something more articulated and not so elementary,1
Lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way. He is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done.,1
if you do not have a background in statistics do not expect to pass this course,1
"Cannot believe UCI have just very short course, compared to san diegi/Duke/Virginia/Copnehagan who have courses worthing thousands of dollars for free as compared to this one. UCI have exception course in objective C which is worth the money to be paid, but this series, are extremely below the expected standard",1
very basic overview. Outdated in some way when it comes e.g. on AR feature extraction methods,1
"I suggest to do this course ONLY if you're doing whole specialization.Course is simply bad, teacher doesn't give to much information and project is very hard to finish.",1
"I was pretty disappointed with this course. Firstly, the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeks--particularly week 2--had A LOT of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one, and then other weeks barely had anything.Secondly, the exercises seemed unclear, poorly thought out and not really helpful. There were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this course.Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms.Fourthly, the ""scaling"" section was also a major disappointment. While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Spark.Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Turi was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist.",1
"The tests were not upto the mark, where the questions were not very logical and the options were confusing.",1
It's often not clear the point the professor of this course is trying to make. Instead he often seems to ramble pointing out a 100 little questions that a world designer might ask himself/herself during the process without ever focusing on any. The reader is left not knowing what the key take aways were,1
"In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria. The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said ""do whatever you want"" and walks out of the door. Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums.",1
"Video after video of lengthy lecture with little variation. It's a long content dump with just two peer-reviewed assignments. If this is the best online Princeton can do, count me out.",1
"This course is not free. You must pay to access assignments and quizzes.I am really annoyed with the direction Coursera is moving in regard to premium content. If they keep up this trend, I'll move to Class Central or other MOOCs.",1
"not what I thought it would be, based on the intro",1
I couldn't access all of the reading materials and could never finish this course.,1
Not so good Lack of interest and practicability,1
Great music but quizzes seem to come from footnotes to the lessons!,1
"Very disorganized. More than a course, it seems more like 2 students learning along with you. The lessons have 0 preparation and they come up with examples that do not work half of the time during the video itself. I do not recommend this course (and as a matter of fact, the entire specialization) to anyone.",1
"IMHO a very superficial course.Lots of outdated material (user-generated content was a big thing 5 to 10 years ago, not anymore). Lacked going in depth.It discouraged me from pursuing the rest of the specialisation.",1
"This course, and the Specialization as a whole, is poorly structured and a rather cursory overview that is unlikely to satisfy serious learners. If the material is completely new to you then it will likely leave you confused as it does not adequately explain the concepts. If you are already somewhat familiar and are looking for deeper dive into R and programming you will be disappointed as the courses just don't have the depth of material needed to gain mastery over the subject.Your money and time would probably be better spent on a couple of books by Wickham.",1
The link to down,1
Where is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and Excel? You have me lost.,1
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money!,1
boring,1
"This course, which is part of Data Science Specialization Course, which is a BEGINNER specialization, doesn't explain as it should to BEGINNERS. They try to explain, complex topics in 3 minutes ... If I didn't need the certificate, I would definitely not waste my time on this course. Youtube videos from khan academy or Brandon Foltz (Statistics 101) are much more valuable, you really get the topic and they are free. The professors didn't want to spend time preparing good material, from my point of view, the preparation is very poor.The course is more oriented to teach you to be a ""data monkey"". You know the code you need to write, but you don't get what are you doing ... Where do these formulas come from?",1
"This class (the fourth in the specialization) required a different version of Unity 3D in order to complete (compared to the first course in the specialization). Using a borrowed laptop, I was not permitted to upgrade to a new version by laptop owner. Signing up for the 5-course specialization and paying in advance was a ripoff since the software requirements changed in between course 3 and 4. Coursera gives no refunds for a 5-course specialization if you have completed the first course.",1
"The course was not prepared at all, badly improvised and with no structure. I wish I could have my money back.",1
joe warren ur better than this,1
"this was a really boring course not for the contet bu the teacher i fell bored every video because the theacher was really slow in everything tha she was showing, it is realy dificult to get focussed in the real topics when the teacher spend a lot of time explaining things at the end wont be evaluated. As an example I am not english native speaker but a had to put the playback speed to 1.50x in order to not get bored in all videos, it was really dificult to follow the teacher at the normal velocity , i just got sleep every video. and as a record i really like this topic so it is the tacher, I took the first course and it was a good experience but this one is owfull",1
Tableau is garbage and their assignment practice questions don't work,1
Very basic,1
Extremely boring and very confusing,1
"The lessons are not very clear and have almost no examples. To make matters worse, the discussion forums were closed so you could not ask anything to clarify things, so it was very difficult to learn things here.",1
Course Project is way outside of what was taught in class.,1
The course content is itself interesting but the lack of active mentors to provide guidance makes the course really difficult to learn. So many unanswered questions on the discussion board and many confused students. I am so glad I am not paying for this course.,1
Damn near worthless. The course material has significant gaps of information. The programming assignments require knowledge that isn't presented in the course. I had to Google my way through this entire course. I would not recommend it.,1
the tests are difficult.,1
"No forum, what are you thinking!",1
"Video content barely summarizes the outline of each module. The questions in the quiz are not ""though provoking"". Peer discussion are rather superficial and do not cover half the content of the course.Readings are OK, show good sources, but there is no real discussion about them in the videos or in the quizzes.",1
"No use for me. No music examples because copyrights did not allow, so the course is pretty boring.Sorry, not for me.",1
"Very poor. Full of errors in videos and quizzes (which affect final grade), no response from course organizers in the forum to multiple complaints from learners, and extremely thin on content. Could have been merged into the first course of the specialization (Introduction to SEO).I've taken $49 one-off certificate classes that provided 4-10 hours of content for 6-8 weeks; for this course I was charged $119 for 1-3 hours of content for what was supposed to be 4 weeks. I completed the course in a couple of days and felt like I learned more from free resources like Moz. Complete rip-off and easily the worse course of the half dozen I've taken on Coursera on various topics. It seems like you're paying for the UC Davis name on the certificates rather than the content.In addition to all that they dropped the price from $119 to $79 per course for the specialization after I paid for it, and refuse to refund the price difference. Fine - but if I'm paying a premium price I expect much better content and service than was received.",1
Very low material not enough examples ( full emails),1
"The professor did not Interact with people, I was wiling to see some discussions and contributions among people",1
Uses R with no explanation. Why does it use a challenging programming language that is not the point. The point is to learn statistics.Use Statcrunch - so students can focus on statistics not programming,1
Very disappointing course. Far too much repetition. A lot of opinion based on scant evidence. It would have been much better as a 30 minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences. I would not recommend this course.,1
I found there was too much information given in the course lectures without enough practice to learn bit by bit to really understand what I was learning.,1
Would have liked to do the assignments if they weren't all locked by payment requirements,1
It's not on architecture for IoT as name suggests. It's general software architecture course.,1
Unprecedented high speaking speed.,1
"A nice idea but very poorly done. This would be cool topic to learn about but it is just so poorly executed.Week 1 was just introduction. Week 2 seemed okay, reasonably interesting with a video that although was somewhat dated in style managed to grab my attention for the 40 or so minutes in length.However Week 3 is where I get off. A 16 minute video of slides, with only a couple of minutes of narration in total with what seems like about 20 links to random articles over the internet Links to articles to read would be fine if done well, but with very little to join them up and link them back to the subject at hand is a bit boring. Also the worst part - the slides aren't posted so in order to get to these articles I had to pause the video and letter by letter type them into the address bar. I gave up after the third article and hit leave course.",1
It is very easy and unusefull course.,1
What is the reason to put together so much details about network packet headers and all other parts of this course? I think this info completely useless here and must be part of any specialized networking course.,1
Heavy contents.. Unable to cover a week's material in a week,1
"I found it very easy. But if you do not know anything about Autism, I think you might would contribute from it.",1
"Personally, I strongly doubt that putting a bunch of slides and a few auto-graded exercises is the best way to learn about logic. Why then Stanford University doesn't just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lectures?I don't see the added value at all. Apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students, what's the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises there?This course to me started off with the wrong foot. No info on the starting date of the course until the end of September, when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month. And now the complete absence of videos. This to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of Coursera, which didn't find an agreement with Stanford University so no material had been produced until now. Then, in order not to completely ruin its reputation, Coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this lie.I might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else, however, I won't recommend Coursera to anyone after this. Very bad feedback so far, and the funny thing is that I had big expectations before the start.Hope this will be taken as constructive feedback and not as a complaint.",1
"is a very very boring curse, don't recommend anyone, please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course, don't embarrass yourself and the universities that represents",1
Great and very informa,1
Class was boring and the professor wasn't inspired nor inspiring.,1
huge gap from lectures and swirl to the assignments.,1
Not a course that helps you solve wicked problems which do not have solutions that will come suddenly one fine day and ones that require more thought effort and brainstorming.,1
they have to put a note that this course is just for Turkish students not for international .,1
"It is told that to take this course, basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessary-this is a beginning level course. Then, in the first module, instructors talk about polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. For someone who have no prior programming experience, these are definitely not suitable topics to start with. Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects. But the lectures were too boring to keep watching. I watched like 10 videos and learned nothing about the course subject. I think I won't be spending my time for this course, which seems to me like reading some reference files.",1
"This should not be a course. It's just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers. This is not a learning course. All they teach you how to install git, R and Rstudio. And they take money for this (if you want to say you ""completed"" the course)!!! Highly unethical practice in my opinion.The surveys are stupid too. They don't distinguish between those who completed (but not earned any credentials) and those who didn't.In my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course (and not a cours in itself). Definitely not worth 4 weeks!A much more valuable course is Stanford's ""Machine Learning"" where you can actually learn something (and don't force you out of evaluation if you don't pay).",1
Putting some numbers on the slide without any explanation of how it works. Only saying what it does.Reading almost only his slide without further information.No basic formulas such as eg. Shannon theorem...,1
"As a manager in an IT consultancy, I can't justify sending my personnel through this course, even at $69 per course. The amount of information gained is very thin and does not move one toward being productive.",1
"This course was not a beginning level course as advertised.Test cases for assignments were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course materials. Quizzes during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material was taught.The course creators obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course. So it is difficult for me to write such a critical review. However, they missed the mark with this one enough that I can't recommend the course.Unfortunately I will not be completing this course only due to the fact that I have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment.",1
"I am having a very difficult time finishing this course. I find the topic dull and the content uninteresting. It is the first course of the CyberSecurity Specialization .. I hope the other courses are not like this.I rated it one star for a couple of reasons.1- I have been in software for many years and I know about software design. I would NOT have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security. I understand its importance, but this course should be part of a UI design course, NOT in a technical CyberSecurity specialization IMO.2 - the course is all about theory, not about practical matters. Let's admit it - today's security software is not for the uninformed/experienced. Given this, again, I feel this course would be better served in another specialization about UI Design or for software design best-practices.That is my .02. I am moving onto other courses before finishing the Usability Security..... I am aware that I will have to complete this course to get my certification. This alone will discourage me from purchasing a specialization in the future.",1
Very disappointed in this course. Light on content and heavy (especially in week 3) on political bias towards one political persuasion. Highly biased and controversial statements by those in videos are taken as fact without any attempt to question it. I expected a course to talk about elections and apply it to 2016. Instead what is here is a course that not so subtly seems to have an agenda. Not good for academic discourse. I believe this is my first negative review in my 3(?) or so years on Coursera.,1
"I have a negative opinion of the structure of this course. It is not laid out in a format that I, a native English speaker, understood. The interviews and recorded lectures were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed. The gentleman that drills his own cavities in his home workshop was most annoying and pointless. Looked at the ceiling Buddha 97% of his screen time.The reading was too disjointed and the book on Mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in Coursera. Professor Wright is too laconic, phlegmatic and unengaging. I wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instructions on how to convert a document in textedit (Mac WP) to the course submission page so that was a total crash for me. I would never recommend this course to anyone.",1
The professor's voice put me to sleep; he was monotone. Online classes work best when interesting material is married to dynamic speakers.,1
"The initial lessons were rather chaotic. The idea was good, but the execution was not really good.The significantly improved the quality for the second course so I assume that for a new iteration, the it will be better too.",1
"The capstone, just like the courses of the specialization are a strong illustration of the problems of higher ed.",1
I wasn't impressed...v few or new material,1
No longer a entirely FREE course.All courses that require you to upgrade to submit quiz answers should be noted in the information about the course! I imagine you are loosing more and more people due to this. Once again greed takes precedence.,1
"The lecturer was an annoying speaker and very repetitive. I just couldn't listen to him... I'm sorry. There was also so much about human development etc that I started to wonder when the info about dogs would start....I found the formatting so different from other courses I've taken, that it was hard to get started and figure things out. Adding to that, was the constant interruption of the ""paid certificate"" page. If I answer ""no"" once, please leave me alone! I also think it's a bit suspect for a prof to be plugging his own book for one of these courses.",1
Could not get to the fourth course and was asked to pay for it twice.,1
"As a stand-alone course this would be very good. The presenter is engaging and clearly knowledgeable, and the treatment of the course subject is thorough and well-designed. Grounding UX design in rigorous statistical analysis is important.BUT as a component of the Interaction Design specialisation it was much too long (nine weeks, as long as the previous three courses combined) and the coursework was un-interesting (long sequences of statistical tests with strange names) and very different to the creative and interactive assignments in the other courses. It very quickly turned into a demoralising ""death march"" for me.As part of the specialisation, this course needs to be slimmed-down radically, and perhaps complemented by other analytical approaches to UX and interaction design. In its current form, the inclusion of this course in the Interaction Design specilisation is represents an error of judgement.",1
"hard to follow not because it is difficult, but the lecture is only slides, texts, reading slides, very boring and not so many hand-on instruction. only thing i remember is the instructor's face after finish this class. Dont know why you add this into such a good specialist.",1
"I think the last project was very badly positioned and explained. First the Coursera is using Cloudera VM, but if you execute and run the Cloudera Express to set the Cloundera environment up the Coursea exercises do not run There should be a warning!. If you do then the simplest Jupyter exercise it fails - this took me about 10 hours to figure out.Then for the final Project, technically to succeed you must miss country names in all lower case and you cannot match with countries with a 'space' e.g. 'Cape Verdi' and if you try to take any of this into account you do not get the same numbers to pass the test. There needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test. Again this too me about 10 hours to resolve. Both resolutions ONLY because another colleague is doing the same course and we problem solved together. THIS IS AN AWFUL EXERCISE in frustration due to incomplete details. Not a learning exercise. Just AWFUL....",1
"The lectures are rather simple and easy to follow, but it's impossible to pass the quizzes with only a basic knowledge of mathematics/physics, only for experts. With the information provided in the video lectures you won't recieve a grade, there's a lot of extra work necessary with no other help given then some wiki that only a math genius would understand without any further help.",1
"The transition from the original Coursera platform to the new one has significantly reduced my overall satisfaction with the course experience (I have previously taken the 4 earlier Rice courses in this series and enjoyed them immensely).Major contributing factors to my dissatisfaction:-- The user interface changes are unwelcome and have detracted from my ability to engage with the material.-- There have been arbitrary (and unannounced) changes to polices, e.g. dropping distinction grading.-- The price increase per course and locking down of assignments to only those who have paid has unfortunate side effects, including.-- In contrast to previous courses in this series which had an active community engagement the discussion forums are now relatively empty, running the courses more often is not going to help this situation.Having previously been an unpaid evangelist for the Coursera approach and materials I now find myself extremely reluctant to recommend this revised experience to colleagues.",1
"Please be advised that this course is not structured as a rigorous close reading, but a general invitation into some central sentiments of the Book of Zhuangzi. Perhaps not the kind of course you are looking for in replacement of a serious college-level class that surveys the book.",1
"I would rename this course as Programming Octave with Application to Machine Learning rather that Machine Learning. Once you start the course you will have to focus on Octave rather than on ML topics if you want to do programming exercises. There is no degree of freedom in programming. You are provided with a lot of weird Octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch. More than 50% of my time was spent in order to learn Octave and understand (guess!!!!) Octave codes.So, if you really want to learn ML and try it in practice this course is not for you. However, you could just watch the videos whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ML.",1
corporate HR focused conflict NON resolution.,1
"Without a doubt the worst course I have ever taken anywhere. When the instructor, who is supposed to be teaching you how to write iOS apps, takes (no exaggeration) SIX minutes to even figure out how to open XCode, you know you're in for a rocky ride. Still, I stuck with it for three more weeks. To my horror, the course only got worse from there.This course was clearly thrown together with a minimum of effort by someone who is not qualified to teach the subject. It's an insult to Coursera customers, and a major failure of quality control.",1
"I did not find the course very good. I came into the class with only real basic knowledge of Python and I was hoping to be able to pick up more as part of this class. WHile I might have picked up more, it was only because I used resources outside the course.The video instructions in programming in Python left quite a few gaps to figure out by reading documentation. The videos themselves were divided into two sections -- first a theoretical or classroom like section and a second a lab/programming section going over some coding in Python. The 'classroom' type lectures were pretty reasonably good. But the lab/programming were pretty terrible.They instructor really break down the syntax of the code and just left the student to figure it out. This made being able to take this code and to adapt it to other uses very difficult.I would not recommend this as a course to help learn Python.",1
"I do not like this course. There are far too many prejudicial ideas - even in the first unit. A language does not have to be used by a single / unified group to define it as a language. Esperanto is a perfectly valid language, fully capable of expression, and does not belong to a single / unified group. There are no native speakers, either - which does not rob it of the fact that there are winners of the Nobel Prize for literature who write in it. The things you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant, they are highly offensive & prejudicial. I cannot conscience supporting a course like this.",1
"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.",1
too hard in practice,1
Terrible course.... the instructor just read out of the power point. No examples or case studies or insights.very disappointed in the class.,1
"I didn't learn anything more than what I already knew- which was basic concepts- and was able to pass anyway. I'm very disappointed. I want to be a good programmer, and this did not teach me any programming.The videos are not conducive to learning. You need a more engaging teaching plan. Don't just read slides to me, I can do that myself. Use videos to explain concepts, but stuff your videos with practice problems. Put more code in the videos and walk me through it. Put in mini-quizzes in the middle of videos, to keep the student aware of how they are doing in short increments. Don't move on to the next thing unless they have learned the first thing.I was unable to complete the projects because the practical coding was not taught - don't throw a third of the course into the first practice I get to without first walking me through short, contained examples of how to actually use the code, and testing me on each piece before putting it all together.",1
too much theory and not nearly enough practical models that I can use in my life or work. Disappointed so much of the class was spent on describing many different models instead of focusing on ones that can be applied readily.,1
I suppose that we should have some basic knowledge of data visualization before this course. There are no practical sessions. I could not understand many topics and it seems that content has been missing from this course.,1
Why should I waste my time listening to someone reading a book to me...,1
"Being honest, the lessons in the course are disconnected with the weekly tests, specially for the final exam. Professor Daniel Egger and his assistan MUST improve the lessons, including examples step by step specially for the multiple linear regression su",1
Week three quiz is real bad. I suggest you give it a try and see for yourself.,1
waste of time and money,1
"This course is extremely hard to follow, not because of the content but because of the delivery. Presentation, ""visuals"", word choice, speed, all very poor. I'm in week 3 and EVERY video has been just as difficult to follow.Quizzes are hard to understand and ask you about things that weren't of any actual value to the course, and/or weren't even covered. Also, because multiple answers are required for each question, you are basically answering a 4 part question that is only worth 1 point. Get one part wrong and you miss the whole 1 point.",1
"Hi!just a terrible course, honestly. couldn't understand a little what was the message you wanted to pass on students.couldn't stand more than a week of this course.Apologies for being over-rude",1
"This course was a complete joke. Many practice quiz questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to re-write test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right. Also, there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course. There is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways, it just takes some effort. Very frustrating to decipher the lazily worded questions. Someone should have proof read this course. I feel like an idiot for paying for it.",1
"The jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience. Plus Coursera really doesn't want you to bother them with your silly questions, relying on peer-forums. If you scroll through the week's discussion forums, many student posts go ignored.You can't drop the course past the second (I guess) week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you've given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing.Will not return to Coursera for any reason. Breathtakingly bad experience.",1

It's a time waster.",1
"I thought the content layout for Courses 1 and 2 were okay. However, when I got to Course 3: Using Python to Access Web Data, I was extremely disappointed. This specialization is advertised as one does not require programming experience. Course 3, however, introduces a variety of computer science topics that I believe cause information overload for a beginner. A student is bombarded with information about regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, web sockets, URLs, HTML, XML, JSON, and APIs. In fact, the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts, while spending very little time explaining how to use Python to access web data. The corresponding book, Python for Informatics, was of little help understanding the assignments. Like the videos, the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples. The few examples that are given lack adequate explanations of the code they contain. I found myself on many occasions asking, ""What exactly does this line or block of code do?"", and could not locate the answer. If not for the forum, I would not have been able to complete th",1
There is no subtitles in English for the video lectures and the slides are in Chinese.,1
"Interesting topic, however I quitted. Video lectures were recorded almost phrase by phrase, making it too hard to follow the contents properly",1
Cant understand whats going on,1
Totally not worth having the certificates.Easy assignments.Good for people who never programmed before.,1
"Bad course. Things mentioned by the instructors are naive. According to my knowledge (my knowledge about Chinese philosophy come from A History of Chinese Philosophy, Youlan Feng; History of Chinese Philosophy, Sze-kwang Lao), that is not Chinese philosophy at all.",1
Not very well put together. It marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct.,1
"animations, animations and animations...",1
As a beginner to the subject... I feel like I know even less if that was possible after just the first few weeks!! I plan to start again sometime in the future and see if I can figure things out in this course.. after I learn about Buddhism somewhere else first!,1
Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer raqting stuff which I despise. And there seems to be no way to un-enroll.,1
"No forum, what are you thinking!",1
"The lectures were good but when it came to quizzes and assignments, we do not know what to do? The questions were very complicated and not stated in the Lectures",1
"Just garbage. This course and its twin ""Introduction to Smart IoT Devices"" are an expression of imposture at high level. Fortunately, the other courses in EIT Digital series are very interesting.",1
"I have done the data sciences specialization from JHU and that was 4 star on 5. Compared to that, this specialization is pretty bad.Not worth doing this specialization. Instructors are clueless on the plan",1
This class was not useful for me. The professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis.,1
Superficial and not well presented.,1
"I can't finish the friggin' course. I can code fluently in HTML, CSS and Javascript, but can't figure out how to upload a PDF assignment here. This student's user experience is atrocious.",1
Worst course on coursera.,1
"I didn't understand very much of this course. Instructor relies heavily on the use of various charts. They were seldom explained in a way I could understand. Instructor seemed to believe that underlining things in the charts served as an explanation. After completing the entire course & listening to many of the lessons several times, I can't tell you ""what we like to hear and why"". Instructor speaks in a monotone with no emotion. Seems bored stiff. Seems like he's just talking, but his mind is elsewhere. Quizzes frequently contained questions for material to be covered in a future lesson",1
"I dislike the way the grade is settled. Because of the difficulty and technicality of the course, passing grade should be 7 out of 9, instead of 8 out of 9. We are not PhD's, but student learners.......",1
The structure of the lectures is not really effective.,1
I really did not understand this course. There was way too much jargon.,1
"Videos were not ellaborative, examples sparse and were not edited to completion. After months of this course repeatedly being delayed we see a complete failure with 'Information Design', both in course and in practice.I was very dissapointed with this course and the time-wasting assignments. I have enjoyed the courses leading up to this one, but this course was obviously rushed and poorly planned.",1
"please provide the complete 5 unit details . I could see only this unit is open for past many months. I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money. Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us. Quite disappointing experience.",1
"Very poor teaching. Extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested, and what is not. They assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught. Half of what they show, you are told to ignore. Obviously smart and capable researchers, but teaching the lay person is not their strong point.",1
"This seemed more appropriate for a startup, and most of the content was rudimentary",1
"Very disappointed with how the transition from the old Coursera platform to the new platform has been handled: lots of instances of the ""see lecture X"" in the quizzes where the reference is now just wrong because the lectures got renumbered, an almost complete lack of community TA/mentors, and no explanations from anyone as to how the new platform works.Perhaps the worst of all has been the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of any problems from the folks at JHU. This feels like it's just been dumped on the students without any real testing or any appropriate resources to sort out any problems.",1
"I was very excited by the topic of this course, but quite disappointed when I finally started it.The content of this course has little to do with its promising title.In fact. the content lacks any coherency. There is no logical development of the course content - it's all disconnected facts told one after another.Another factor is the delivery. I know the teachers are Italians & English is not their first language and that is fine. But they are just reading out the content - that's all. They are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent takes some time to get used to.Both content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though I was (and am) really, really interested in this topic.",1
topic is interesting however the lecturers not quite lively,1
not very good audio.,1
I found this course is very much theoritical. I should have included mathatical models and ways to relate them with our day to day life.Thanks,1
"This is for people doing social work in third world countries. Trust me, videos discussing open defecation and child marriage get old fast. Also, the stuff about social norms is very confusing and hard to understand.",1
Its very boring. Just someone reading off slides. One could read from a book instead. No examples or explanation to the information on the slides.,1
"Requires MATLAB. In my view, a university should not be promoting a proprietary product. There have been other Cousera courses which used Octave, the free-software implementation of the programming language implemented by MATLAB.I have seen no good reason why Octave should not have been used for this course.",1
"Maybe a good course, but you need to be an IT crack to be able to install the software and make it works. Online help does not help. Irritating! 45USD lost. I don't recommend this course.",1
"Very low content: I got more information about Berklee than about music from this course. It is more of a show-off of the university than it is an actual informative course. Looks a lot like a yt tutorial, just much fancier because they are berklee. I watched from the beginning to the end waiting for them to start talking about anything other than naming intervals, but it didn't happen. They try to ear-train you, but any app for ear-training will do it better. Quite disappointing.",1
"Barely any contents in the course. Only a few minutes of lectures, no quizzes and poorly constructed assignments that waste a lot of time. Weeks 2 and 4 have the worst material I've seen in all the courses I've taken until today.",1
Very basic and boring,1
"Despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for Robotics, I think the way they are treated is very poor.In my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow them.Lectures are completely useless and most of the time quizzes are note related with them.In order to solve quizzes you have not only to recover prior knowledge, that it is obvious, but also to search for new arguments somwhere in the web, in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained. In that contest what are the quizzes, what should quizzes have to test if no content is given?Moreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures, questions are confused and ambiguous. It is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledge.I think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futility.I arrived at the end of the course just because I'm doing the specialization otherwise I would have left in the middle of the first week.I'm very disappointed.",1
"Course work was entirely optional and only started at the end of week 2. The required level of involvement was too low to be helpful. I don't learn well just watching lectures - I can get that much from YouTube!!! However, I expect a bit more when paying $500 for a specialisation.The first module in the series was too basic but at least there was a lot of coding involved. This (second) module didn't even have that.",1
This is a gigantic waste of time,1
Totally not what I expected. Most of it was concerned with mathematical problems.,1
all on demand flow are bad. difficult to follow and see where we are and what is left...,1
"A list of research papers to read further that's it. The course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.The programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's ""do it"" any language. The 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course. We don't even talk about the algo to use to do it. It looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.It shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.Ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.I think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to Coursera, the university and the professor.It needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.I am going to try another Coursera course in the same kind of subject I hope it won't be the same.",1
Coursera does not want to give me a Certificate. I've got 95% for this course,1
Lectures have very poor teaching skills.,1
Course content is way too easy and inadequate to do any useful work.,1
"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :(",1
"Very basic. All this information of this course can be self taught by Googling and the hands on exercise at the end of the course is a joke. For the $59 price of the course, expected more.",1
"I have studied some Bayesian Statistics before. I feel like the materials itself is not sufficient for entry level, and will actually confuse some of the learners. Anyway, this is just my two cents. :)",1
"greed rules.... previously the course was free including the quizzes to check whether one learned something or not; now you have to pay 60$ just to check your learning progress (I do not need a certificate, just learning for myself)",1
"Course could have earn my stars.Money, money, money is not the way to go.",1
"repetitive content with other MOMA courses (seeing thru pictures)?? duh, not gonna pay $50 for this. :(",1
"Sucks....The audio quality sucks, the video quality is also miserable. The topic is good though.",1
"This course is one of the few lesser courses I've seen on Coursera, since the course instructor has shown little commitment to course material preparation compared to other course instructors. He reads off the bullet points on the powerpoint slides without any elaboration. This seems to be part of an introductory specialization to emerging technologies. Yet merely stating keywords without explaining them makes the learning process very difficult for learners new to the fields. With the video lecture length totaling at ~1.5 hours, this ""course"" clearly needs to have more materials. A learner should not be tricked into paying $39 for an 1.5 hour reading of powerpoint slides.I have watched a few video lectures of the other courses in this specialization, and the presentation of material reflects problems aforementioned.Please considerably improve this course or remove this specialization from course catalog. It's not fair for us learners and other course providers who want to revolutionize online learning experience.",1
"Not clear illustration， many problems are not directly related to the content covered. More importantly, it sucks!",1
Very bogus and boring content. The monotonous voice gets me!,1
"I enjoyed the other courses in this specialization, but the capstone was disappointing. The course was not very structured and did not draw from the other courses in a substantial way. It was often difficult to see how the readings related to the projects. The course could use a lot more curation and direction.",1
"I think the teacher had to little expression , it was like he was reading loud, and I felt I might have red the text myself. I lacked some enthusiasm",1
"This is a complete waste of time. The other courses were really good but with this course I:Learned nothing newUnlearned best practises from the previous coursesMick doesn't seem to understand what he is presenting himself at times, the supplied code does not match the video's, the assignments change when I already submitted it (from upload a zip to deploy) and the assignments are copy pasted. I think it would help to take this part out of the specialisation.",1
One week of this course was only marginally relevant to the subject. The instructor even said as much.,1
"Don't be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are. The second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos. There were even a few typos and errors. Be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz. I was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research. I was hoping to complete the specialization for this, but it doesn't seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed.** The use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course.",1
There is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes.,1
"This course needs a total overhaul; in its current state it is a detriment to both Coursera and the Wharton Online brand. First, there was relatively little content; there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved. Second, the material was pitched at a very basic level, but not in a good way. Third, the tests didn't manage to even test the material being covered. For example, when given a mean and stdev, when asked to find a value, often the lecture would use an approximation ( i.e., a 2-tailed 95% distributed = 2.00 std devs. ) This is a class on excel: there is NO excuse for not introducing norm.s.inv and norm.s.dist when asking that question. When the test required the ""approximation"" rather than the exact calculation? Everything about this course was wrong, it needs to be scrapped and thrown away.",1
It felt like amateur course. the volume was very low and was missing videos,1
This course assumes that you are familiar with freeRTOS.,1
"this course is incredible boring. I'm really interested in the topic, but the way it is presented is just sad. only theory and slides with way too much text. I've already taken several ML classes and this one is still hard to follow. Can't recommend it.",1
this course is very poorly structured.,1
kind of okay but...,1
The course is just terrible.It leaves an impression of being unfinished. There's a lot of knowledge missed out from lectures while being expected from the student in the quizzes.Lecturers themselves have a very vague understanding of how java works and how to code in real life. What they say in some lectures is very misleading and gives either false or just insufficient understanding of certain mechanisms.The examples are overcomplicated. They demand a full concentration on domain knowledge rather than on programming itself.,1
"Was expecting soo much more from the entire courses. Not a single practical part, soo much talk and write.Sorry would not share the course with friends, 190€ is too much for what I have just learned.",1
one of the most boring courses I have ever taken.....I had to force myself to finish it. the teacher is charismatic but the content is just theories and abstract ideas.....just blah blah blah,1
Boring,1
"This course is not worth taking, especially if you have to pay for it! It is boring and you hardly learn anything. Do not take this class, it is not worth your money.",1
"There should be an instructor available to address specific grading concerns. Peer-grading is too subjective and students use their opinions as opposed to rubrics for grading, and often do not read all the material prior to assigning a score.",1
The quiz in this course is not helping this learning experience to be positive,1
"Really horrible in instruction, experience and application ability of lecturers, poorly put together and assembled. It was astonishing to experience such self-promoting hacks rather than knowledgeable practitioners of the art of meditation. It is very important to clarify the content of a somewhat titled misnomer. The course was an academic study in mediation bring is rather esoteric, questionable, and personal opinion concepts and comments; in effect a mesh-mash.",1
"It was really focused on high level concepts of different technologies, the level was really basic. No details have been served.",1
"I was expecting 4 weeks of work, but it was more like 4 hours.",1
Not very useful.,1
Nothing practical,1
"i gave this course 1 star not because its bad in content, its just because i was expecting more due to the fact it has been delayed several times; then when it finally came it was like any other youtube or online tutorial. i was expecting something as big as udacity but unfortunately its not. Don't expect to know or understand java with this course, no practical or step by step example in this course. what makes it worst is the fact they never show you how to build an app from scratch while the only app they have in this course, they dont do it. you have to do it on your own.dont get me wrong. all of them are good instructors but the way they did it, its definitely is not a beginner friendly. give a calculator as an assignment to build while you never built one app in this course, i think its not an effective way to teach. i will not pay for this specialization. i will do the udacity nanodegree one",1
"Lectures and other material just don't cover the information needed in the course project. Majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course, in order to pass the course project.I cannot recommend this course anyone who is not deeply familiar with the topic already. The course project is truly frustrating!",1
I posted questions and couldn't find any answer. The course also doesn't allow me to be creative (although it's about design!) in answering assignments.,1
I just do not feel a connection with this professor - he is constantly plugging his book and the website. The content is just not engaging.,1
"Hard to follow, ideas are not organized and are not well presented. Lecturer has many pauses, that even on increased playback speed (x1.25), are still distracting. Do not recommend!",1
The labs in this course have fundamental flaws which mean they cannot be completed. This is a major failing in a paid course such as this.,1
"It is very basic and the principles are for a third-grader. After all the things said, at the end the first video was about pancakes (nvm they were gluten free)",1
pathetic,1
All the assignments are so unclear and you´ve to lose so much time trying to understand the goal of the problem.,1
The instructors are not well prepared for the course. The material are not well structured.,1
"Hopelessly fast, compared to the excellent Basic Statistics by the same team. I gave up in week 1.",1
"Possibly the least well structured class ever. Also, not made for people to actually learn how to program in R. It is sad that I paid for this, and ended up going to another resource to learn... and it was much much easier.",1
This is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course. Highly disappointed...,1
"I think that it would be a good idea to improve the grader, release more informative assignment information (take a look at the Algorithms course for example) and lecture materials in pdf format.",1
"Interesting subject matter, but difficult to understand as a native English speaker. Very awkwardly worded and error-ridden tests.",1
No allow to submit quiz,1
the assignments were very hard to understand. the course videos were poor.,1
You cannot even complete the first quiz before they demand your :P,1
I don't like the teacher,1
"I was denied completion of this course because a fellow course taker felt the need to ""grade"" unfairly. I suggest all ""peers"" keep in mind we are here to learn not to be judge so critically. The spirit of the course was destroyed by a thoughtless action. If you wish to be critical that's fine but at least have the courage to leave feedback for me to review. Coward.",1
"I am disappointed about this course. I was expecting to learn more in this subject as described on the course info. However, the quality of the lectures is not good at all. I haven't found any lecture that present the knowledge as the Ivy league University as Yale. I felt sorry for the students who actually attained this class at Yale campus. The professor was not prepare for the lectures and confused/forgot sometime. I was hoping that the Nobel prize winner would teach something that complicated in the simple way. The questions in the exam ask mostly about year, person, numbers which is not the good exam per my perspective. If you want the have the certificate from Yale, you can take this course. BUT if you want to learn about Financial Markets, I would not recommend this course. I'm so sorry.",1
"Poorly designed, no help whatsoever from the staff, Forum is totally worthless. Worst course I ever had on Coursera.",1
"Cannot do the tests after modules, no reply from staff.",1
Peer Reviewed Assignment not a well planned marking system. Grades can be to vary. Dependent on fellow students for pass not most ideal.,1
"If possible, I would give this course zero stars. It provides an incredibly closed minded view towards all topics and provides very minimal factual information. The makers of this course, and especially the instructor, obviously have had very little to no experience of any kind with most of the topics they discuss.",1
"very poor. even though for the most part I found the videos engaging, the course's overall structure doesn't help to 'read the novel together', as is stated in the title. the quizes are poorly written, even for me, a native russian speaker, it was often hard to understand the questions, and sometimes its plain guess work on the opinions of the course authors. often a required number of answers to pass a quiz is the same as the total number of questions in that same quiz. the essay's topics rarely correspond with the actual reading of the book. for the very first week the essay required knowledge of the book that hasn't been read yet by the participants. or it should be stated that one needs to read the book prior to taking the course. then again that would require the change of the course's name.",1
No good without the missing course and capstone projects,1
Not impressed with the teaching style.Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.,1
"The only reason i passed was because i ignored the lectures and asked others for help, once i did that finance became a lot easier to understand.",1
"This course offer a lot of interesting topics, but the way of their presentation is not very amazing, so the student loses easily the concentration.",1
"This course is bad!I had come upto week 4. While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. I would venture to make some suggestions:a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much. A good example is the Coursera ""The Global Financial Crisis"", which I am also doing currently.d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like ""In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"" or ""To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"" or ""What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?""Kudos to Chris and his team! On the whole, knowledge wise, this is a good course.",1
Please update the given Gemfile in Homework.,1
"Taking this course in January/ February 2017, I found it to be jumbled, out-dated and frustrating.Materials are presented in a chaotic, roundabout way, which is neither chronological nor thematic, leaving huge lacunae. The initial lecture started with an entirely uncontextualised location-visit to Lewes, and mention of the Battle of Lewes in the Barons' War, with plenty of merry jumping over the *rather more important* Magna Carta. In later lectures, there is similar dancing around the English Civil War, which is shocking, given its constitutional importance... and then lots of vague, hand-wavy references to European law. I understand that these lectures were filmed before last summer's shock result in the EU referendum, but - honestly - would it have killed Professor Gearey to have discussed the context and possible implications of the referendum? By contrast, I'm currently following a Futurelearn course which is a repeat iteration of the original material (that's how online courses are viable - I understand that) BUT which the educator cared about enough to updated with topical material from the very week in which we were following it (Week 1 of President Trump)!It would have been far better to have gone into the Common Law course with clear historical anchors (e.g. Magna Carta, Civil War, Great Reform Act, EU membership), which would have given a proper framework for studying the development of common law, through cases and precedent. Instead, we get Professor Gearey sliiiiiiding into half a dozen subjects per lecture and then ""leaving that question there for a later lecture.""I must mention that other lecturer is much more coherent, and that he talks sensibly through various cases, actually demonstrating how precedent works. However, that's just not enough to make up for Professor Gearey's flibbertigibbet style of exposition, which seems to make up the bulk of the course.On a technical level, the un-corrected transcripts of ""lectures"" were a huge headache, since they didn't make much more sense than the lectures themselves, and at times made even less sense, due to incorrect transcriptions. It was particularly frustrating to have legal references mis-spelled (e.g. ""Blackstone"" as ""Blackspen""), making it difficult to track down better sources to supplement the lectures.I can't actually be bothered to see this course through to the end, and am very glad I didn't purchase it.",1
"It is more like a Junit course in the beginning or as far as i could watch. The methodology is not very precise and I could think in a few enhancements.Still, I could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method. No more than this.",1
"Not happy about the course. Very very general information. This can be obtained through any internet reading and doesn't require a purchase of the course. 79 dollars is not peanuts for many countries. The lecturers often refer to the videos which are not part of this course. Examples: PPP valuation has not been part of lectures, but is referred to. Maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to, but was not part of the course. For the money - we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course. Not satisfied at all. Just finished all the tests and passed, but not happy. Do not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course.",1
Just like other University of Maryland online courses - boring,1
"The ""professor"" spews the material like reading poetry. The material is disorganized jumping from one topic to another and back. The quizzes are just plain dumb containing questions like ""what article was written by authors x, y, z"". The homework is barely related to the material and one of them, the one that made me abandon wasting further time with this class consists of wasting a huge amount of time (days) configuring parameters and running an application over and over again to tune them(waiting up to ten minutes on my i7 machine to make one pass over the data). My impression is that this guy didn't spend any time to prepare this course and just used the material/homework from a more advanced class that he did previously. You will not learn almost anything by taking this class, as none of the topics is explained well and is the opposite of self contained. Just a huge waste of time...",1
"Instructor gives minimal examples and says ""go look on stack overflow"". Then he proceeds to assign problems that don't really cover what the slides, lectures, or examples were on. If I all I was trying to do was just read some docs and look on stack overflow I wouldn't need to take this course now would I?Poorly translated and cryptic instructions for assembling furniture are better than what you get here.",1
"the peer review was a waste of time, some individuals submit whatever other review whatever; I found that the assessment criteria is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work, and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project. I am taking another course which as well has peer review, I am rethinking if it's worth it.... do not see any value, there is no real feedback from instructor. If I need it a peer review, I could just ask my colleagues at work.",1
"You should tell people before they enroll that, to take the quizzes, they must pay. It was a waste of time...",1
"GOOD:topicsBAD:presentation (poor sound, unprepared and unrehearsed presentations, long intro's, unjustified use of greenscrenns, etc)shallow with regards to the theoretical aspects of what it is presentedassignments are mechanical (easier than the tutorial and you have to perform the same tasks for different constants for several times)",1
Great title of lection but their content's scarce,1
"If this class is truly designed and welcomes beginners who have no knowledge in SEO as it is described in course introduction, assignment instructions should be provided with sample writings or rubrics. The writing assignment instruction reads,for example, ""Identify headers, alt-text, and etc. and recommend how to improve them for optimization."" Where does it say provide alt-text images for recommendation, make a tie to the recommendation, and list references for the images recommend, if not 3 points off? The lectures are short, doesn't show much details of what is expected for audit writing or analysis writing, but my 2 page analysis or audit is not enough because a thorough rubric expects to see this and that that is not even mentioned in instruction? It is a common sense that a writer has to be detail-oriented with recommendations? Then the course SHOULD not encourage SEO beginners who has never seen SEO audits or analysis paper. If not, assignment instruction should be listed thoroughly as rubric, so that a beginner SEO student can pass the writing and take it as a learning experiences. Endless flunking mal-grading system, is this Coursera's education method?",1
Much of the assignment was out of date. The content was not related to big portion of the assignment. There was no way of getting clarification over the outdated assignment content.,1
"Too much statistics, too much coding and inadequate instruction. This is not a coding specialization and if I wanted to learn coding I would have taken a coding course! This 9 weeks course has been a nightmare!",1
The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.There is no extra information in addition to the presentation. The teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.,1
"I can't even make pre-course survey, which couldn't have wrong answers",1
"I've started the course and i have found ""learn to program"" part, but where is ""quality code""?",1
"No significant instruction/teaching provided. Appears to function only as a self-directed workshop, which doesn't teach the craft itself. Disappointing.",1
Horrible experience as a student. No moderator or the faculty replies to your queries. The instructor has just left the course to take its own accord. It is frustrating to get such a response when you have paid a hefty much for the course.,1
I am not very happy with this course. It lacks depth. Reading the text book gives more understanding. The videos are just verbatim repetition of what is there in the book. The concepts are not explained well. No examples and no case studies. And further there are errors in quizzes. The first course in this specialization was really good... course 2 and 3 were also very informative. But 4 and 5 are not up to the mark and not meeting the high expectations set by the previous courses.,1
Boring,1
"Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies"". Because that's it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. I'm pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitively not recommend this course. Waste of time if not even waste of money.",1
Not everything is explained well so very challenging for someone with no prior coding experience.,1
"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.",1
"A lot of things to improve, specially thr learning courve is from 1 to 100 and a lot of pre knowledge need, your future public is the hobby robotics people who want to expand their knowledge, a litlle more weeks maybe two can increase the likes for the course. Check this one Control of Mobile Robots you can get an example of a good learning curve",1
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,1
"i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week 1 the assignments and quizzes don't seem to relate to the course content. we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next. i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the R language, its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in 4 weeks.programming is hard enough as it is.",1
"Had I taken this course without prior knowledge of the subject, without a doubt I would have quit the course after the first lesson. As it is, I gladly clicked the unenroll button after 5 mins into the start of the instructor's week three video. I honestly don't know why I bothered to continue torturing myself as long as I did.John Holbo makes grasping Plato more complicated than it needs to be. In fact, his lessons are nothing more than useless 'white noise' and ill attempts at humour.I recommend NOT taking this course. It does not offer any enlightenment, but will only obfuscate and turn people off from wanting to understand Plato.",1
"There are ideas we are all familiar with in this course. Good ones for a new teacher who may be oblivious but there is little concrete information about what those ideas look like in a class setting. For example, there might be a discussion of leadership or respect but no ideas about what those look like. It's a lot of teacher talk with no substance.",1
Waste of money. What I learned in the first course could is useless information.,1
"Very unclear in the way it was presented and the subject that are being talked about and not very interesting, partly because it was to easy for me.",1
I expected something else.,1
"The content of the videos are just some engineer citing with some brief headline of security, it's lacking of depth and explanation, totally wasting my time !!",1
"Very little participation so very little help to be found on the forums, and from what I can tell, absolutely zero staff participation. After a couple weeks it's looking like a waste of money.",1
"I've not found this course organized pedagogically speaking. The organization, insofar as ""here is a list of stuff I'll be teaching"" makes sense. But a lot of the ""teaching"" is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background. It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening.",1
"When you are late in delivery, they tell you ""everything is fine, do not worry, you have until the last week of the course to complete the activity, get your note and end of the course."" They'll repeat over and over again in every week. My course ended on May 15, but they have not let me present my last activity, May 3 even before the final exam. They have forced me to leave the current session, still unfinished deadlines, missing a single activity after two months of work, and enroll again in the next session, which still nor has begun, delaying all the planning I had made for the entire course and all terms of the following courses.In short, disastrous system to keep deadlines and complete the courses that make it totally useless any planning you have to do to set the course for the months that suit you, which, in my case at least, may at risk which I can complete the full specialization before the deadline. Money thrown away.",1
"It said it could be done on your schedule, but that is not true. I want to withdraw from this stupid course - it sucks.",1
Which practice?,1
"OK, you can learn a few things getting into this course and it's still available for free on the platform so thanks for that!However and most of all, you can sense that this is more of an advertising campaign for AXA IM than an investment course per se... During the 4 modules, you're basically repeated over and over again that Active Management (ie. Investment Managers) tend to overperform and that you should have one manager.There's even the overall 1st part of Module 4 that is dedicated on how to select a manager...There are some great insight related to portfolio allocation but not much explanations. A major point that I would have liked to hear about is how to come up with the risk aversion criteria... Many parts of the course relate to external videos available on Youtube.If you're going to advertise on such a platform as Coursera please don't make it too much about the advertising and more about learning... (for example: Melbourne University Specialization).",1
I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this course for the following reasons:1- bad course design structure2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence3- super fast without providing any intuition4- no fundamental explanation5- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject,1
"No clear explain about which is the right dataset to be downloaded, no support from instructors about that on discussion forum.",1
"This is a course almost without any content. You coul pick any book about game design and you will learn more of game design in the first ten pages. I recommend Level up! by Scott Rogers for begginers like me. You could be fooled by this course if you dont know the principles of design and narrative structure, but if you know it you will not find anything of value here, becouse dont explain almost anything about videogame concepts like gameplay, balace, GAME DESIGN, etc. They explain very basics things in the first course and then they forget everything. The rest of the information are very very basic knowledge about character and world design, without being vinculated through metodologies to the games!, only with empty words of inspiration recorded in useles videos. Sorry the critics, but i followed all the courses and paid the monoey for the certificate, hoping that some week the course could show somethign usefull. Never did. See for books if you want to learn something.",1
"This is the worst course I have ever seen in my life, I'm ain't lying these guys use the terms which they haven't thought and they use it so frequently as if they have thought it, One who were teaching may be industrial experts and have lot's of experience, but one thing to note is:Teaching is an art...",1
"Can't actually be done as a free course, like others on the site; you have to pay just to get a quiz grade.",1
"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments. The AWS final assignment is a very much throw you into the deep end with no real instruction (well at least completely outdated instructions) and will expect you to swim (or more likely for most people, to drown).I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",1
"This course is good to improve the listening skills, but the note taking is really boring, because it is focused in only one method, the Conell Note, This disregards individual differences, and I don´t think this method is the best for me.",1
Assignments not always in line with lecture.Material is above beginner level.,1
Terrible course.... the instructor just read out of the power point. No examples or case studies or insights.very disappointed in the class.,1
"I dont like the tools they used, it seems like a promotion for their company.",1
"Forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lame.Other than that, courser is very boring, introductory, jumps constantly between things and doesn't explain much. Stack overflow and 2 hours would do a better job.",1
"This course was terribly underwhelming. There is no interaction from the Wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study. Grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis. of Any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context. Very disappointed in this offering. After taking the Data Analysis specialization offered through Duke University I know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.",1
"I wouldn't pay $49.00 Dlls. for this course, nor the other courses within this specialization. This one contains quite a lot of errors. There's a lack of domain of the matter by the instructor and some concepts are poorly explain and incorrectly defined. It's quite a shame that this course is in behalf the UMAN's name :(. Hope this course gets upgraded",1
Not learning much and constantly being bombarded with sales tactics. Not impressed.,1
This is more of an introduction to statistics lesson than one in excel... not what I had signed up for,1
"Honestly, I'm very disappointed with this course. The content taught in this course is not in accordance with the assignments. It is like someone taught to be a builder and asked to build the Brooklyn Bridge ... Not fair at all.If you are going to ask to build a bridge, teach me how. If you teach me how to be a builder ask me for a wall, not a bridge.",1
I have a hard time focusing on what he is trying to say. He seems all over the place and doesn't seem to follow a path that I can understand. I'm sure live it's different but when you're taking it online and parts are,1
"Not really enough content to be a course in it's own right, should be additional material as is useful, but definitely not a requirement.",1
"There's no way to get help in this course. I'm stuck on one of the quizzes -- probably just something easy that I've mis-read-- but there's no way to ask questions, so there's no way for me to complete the quiz. This is very frustrating!",1
"As a developer I consider this a very poor course. It can be good for manager and business people to better understand what technologies are available these days, but that it. You can easily look at the syllabus, go to the wikipedia and read the pages on presented subject and you will get the same knowledge. There were no programming assignments, quizes and exams were not challenging at all and some questions were really confusing. I won't recommend it to anyone and it shouldn't be part of this specialization.",1
nothing in common with reality. nothing that can prepare for real interviewuseless loss of time,1
"This course does not live up to the high value that I've come to enjoy and expect at Coursera. The videos are read by the ""teachers"", so the inflections are wrong, making it very hard to follow. The videos are clipped short and cut off the words at the end. The information is given so quickly with terms not explained that a novice will likely not understand parts of it. I found no value here. There are far better tutorials on the web. I can't see how any college or university would respect any certificate from this course.",1
The class is very very basic for the offered price. Not suitable for someone from Computer science background looking to learn Python as this can be done with couple of hours of self study. Not sure why Coursera would make such begginers class mandatory for the specialization.,1
"This course is very difficult to follow, not because the topics are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturer's poor job in explaining and creating a narrative.",1
"Poor, very poor course, worse course structure. Instructor hasn't put any thoughts in how they should strucutre this course.Cover no basics, assumes lots of thing and term this course as beginner for Java where actually there is no Java taught.",1
This course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who has spent any time around business or government negotiations. It really seems as though the instructor either assumes all of her students are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary.,1
"I am disappointed with the course because of its only focus on Apple TV and smartwatch apps. The course structure is a bit messy and the content is quite technical. Don't call it ""App Design"" since it's more App Development!",1
"I feel that I wasted my time and money on this course to be very honest. Should have requested a refund when I could. The professor really doesn't put in the effort like other professors on Coursera. He is literally reading out the content on each slide. The content isn't very enlightening either, it's just facts about mobile technology and their release dates. One can read that up on wikipedia I honestly think this course should be taken off this platform so no one else falls for it as I did. If you're reading this before you enroll, don't do it, don't waste your time and money on this.",1
Not much here,1
"Really I haven't seen a course with slides till now,No one will be interested to take a course like this, with some slides to read from.",1
Not enough support!I,1
i need practical information but this video was full of tables,1
Not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst. Hard to understand what he's trying to say.,1
"most part of this course is a duplicate of the ""R programming"" course.microphone/sound of the teacher quality is very bad.not original, boring, dividing this in ""4 weeks"" is too ridiculously long, this should be done in 1 week to enable users to take more time for the ""R programming"".this course should be free. don't lose too much time on it, it's doable in a day or a weekend and move on to ""R programming"".asking for so much money to see how to install R and github is a shame.feels like this course has been added just to have a round number for the specialization.even the survey in the end asking for feedback starts with a question not adapted to moment it's been asked ""did you get a certificate?"" of course i did not as i've just finish the course and now wait for my peers to review my final submission.",1
"Contrary to what is being billed here, all the concepts here are from the more traditional school of marketing. The way the 4Ps are explained and applied (through barely) related to consumer products that are retailed. Digital marketing has barely made a dent in their revenues.Technology products don't follow this model.Another annoying aspect of this course is that things are not well defined so they can't be applied. ""customer co-creation"" is presented as a ground breaking idea but it is defined so vaguely. The definition states that customer co-creation is any contribution by a customer or otherwise that helps shape the products. What is considered contribution? Is product feedback contribution? If so, this idea is as old as a Bazaar. Or does the customer actually have to do creative work, in the case of Threadless.The big problem with this course is that it does not introduce the student to any new mental frameworks, leave alone anything practical. This course is a prime example of academiaitis - ideas created in ivory towers without any practical input or use.",1
"Use very specific environment that cannot be used in practice in the the Real World.For a much better course, use UC San Diego versions.",1
"Awful course. The lectures IN NO WAY prepare you for the final assignment which is supposed to take two hours. The ""course"" consists of really boring videos of the instructor using Galaxy and in no way teaches you anything about using Galaxy or how it works. The lectures and quizzes are a joke. You can pass the quizzes just by watching the videos. I got to the final assignment and had no clue what to do if you. I know nothing about bioinformatics, or NGS (which is why I took and paid for this stupid course) so I spent WEEKS on the final assignment and I STILL could not finish or pass the course. Whoever allows this course to still exist and waste people's time and take their money should be ASHAMED of themselves. Read the discussion forums and you'll see what I'm talking abut. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",1
Very weak presentation. Must be improved to keep attention.,1
"This course is misleading in a lot of ways. It is not for beginners at all. The quizzes in the course are beyond impossible. The lecture videos give an introduction to some concepts, but you are left on your own to figure everything out. They do not provide the proper tools to enable students to understand or pass. Reading through a lot of the discussion boards, there are two types of students: 1. those like me, who have never programmed in their life, and cannot figure any of this out, and 2. Those who have all sorts of experience and write things that are way advanced for a ""Beginners"" course.Do yourself a favor, and seriously do some research on appropriate programs before signing up for this one. It needs to be structured way better than what it is now.",1
"The first three classes in this certification were excellent; this course was anything but that. There seems to be a significant disconnect between the first three courses (probability, inference, linear regression) and the fourth course (bayesian). I do not have a strong statistics background but I felt the first three classes in the certification challenged me, while providing an adequate level of support and thorough / articulate examples; the pace was perfect. Yet, with the fourth course I believe that either: 1) there needs to be a bridge course that prepares you for the bayesian course, or 2) the material needs to be taught at a slower pace with more specific and well presented examples / frameworks to work from. Although I was able to complete the course, I will now have to find an alternative source to learn from in order to really understand bayesian stats.",1
"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",1
"Too much surface, not enough depth.",1
"I was really, really hoping that this course would be educational. I personally work with an individual with AS and I excepted to have a better insight into some of the things he goes through. So far, however, I have found many of the lectures condescending. As a person with a disability I find it highly offensive when people speak like they're doing the person with whatever kind of disability a favor for even helping them. People with disabilities are just that, people.",1
Misleading course name/title. Was expecting a course on using Excel. Forums were cluttered and not monitored often.,1
I tried giving zero stars. This course is very poor. In particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught. If I had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff I would not have spent money on this course.,1
"Dear Professors/Instructors/TAs/moderators/coders:It is very good for you to start your work in a very early time! BUT it is so rude to send emails/notifications/greetings/reminders to me in a very early/late time (e.g., 7AM, 10PM). During that moment, I was waked up frequently by your emails which do NOT include a big deal.",1
"The assignment code is ambiguous and the assignment is not clear! The lecture is not much helpful than I thought it would be. Overall, I would not recommend this course if you don't need the certificate.",1
I'm pretty much always turned off when a course won't let those who are auditing the course (i.e. not paying) take the assessments. I'm dropping out.,1
"The ""Soul Beliefs"" course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias. If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down, they partially succeeded. Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak.A better title for the course would be ""why there is no soul"". That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda.",1
"Instructor speaks too slow and sometimes hardly audible with my earphones plugged in with 100% sound. Incredibly slow paced. Coffee must!!! Too much of story and history and introduction. Much less material presented for concepts shown. Much of the lecture time is wasted on things which does not matter, for example Djikstra shortest path... I would be more interested to know about the algorithm than a huge lecture on who is Djikstra, and also would like to have some exercise to implement the same and realise. Very unsatisfied with the course. But there is no other courses offered for C++ programming language in English Language. Not worth the time.",1
This class is taught a terrible pace and is very old-school in it's thinking. It was pretty painful to get through actually,1
"This course is a pure advertisement for IBM products. I entered the course expecting to learn about Raspberry pi and Python and got nothing our of it! If you are really looking to learn about IoT, check out a course called "" An introduction to programming IoT"" by University of California, Irvine. I am taking this course right now and already learning a ton! This course, on the other hand, is a total waste of time.",1
"I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really. There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject.",1
Speed is very fast for a basic level student. The data explanation and correlation demonstrated is not clear.,1
"Very boring presentation of the material. I am sorry to say so, but the professor is not a very engaging speaker.",1
Instructor doesn't seem to be passionate about giving the lecture,1
"This course was very boring and very frustrating. Long long slow lectures with lots, and lots, and lots of questions, and no answers. The briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics, but no links to enable those to be followed up. Quizzes on concepts not covered in the material. Conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements. Discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for. Before taking this course I could find only one negative review, which I dismissed as probably being a minority. Having taken the course, I agree with that review wholeheartedly. I did learn a couple of things, despite everything, but I would not recommend this course. Please upgrade it substantially.",1
"The irony of the fact that a course that was meant to teach how to appropriate evaluate adult learners was full of quizzes that were riddled with ""guess what I'm thinking"" short answer questions and multiple choice questions with > or < 1 correct answer was not lost on me. I ended up leaving the course during week three after issues with a quiz that was described in the forums as ""impossible."" It's too bad - the course description was very promising.",1
"Certainly not a beginners course. You needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course. The final assignment asked you to do things you hadn't been taught. As I hadn't done any programming for 20 years, I certainly found this difficult. Fell behind and there isn't really anyone there to help. Almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue. I'm struggling to motivate myself into the second course. I really hope it's better than the first one.",1
The information is not presented well and the math is not always taught.,1
Some exercises need some improvement. Tests were not that helpful and the instruction to the last homework was quite bad (many open questions).,1
"Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better.",1
I struggled so hard! No way near the same level as the other courses.Came from Computer science background and felt that I missed so many terms and concepts that were required for this course,1
Really badly organised. Course lectures are interesting however end of section quizes have no relevance to the material taught. There are no external links or additional relevant material attached to even link the question to the lessons taught.,1
"Disappointed ... very technical course and not so practical for today's world, there is a lot of terms and subjects that you require a good background in statistics analysis to understand well. It is a shame that this take part of the specialization program.",1
"I am very unhappy about the Course Certificate for the following reasons : it doesn't state what subjects have been covered, it doesn't mention the hours of study involved. The certificate has a worthless appearance. In comparison I had a very good MOOC Statement of Accomplishment from the university EPFL which I can send to you if you are interested in making any improvements. jack.fairgrieve@gmail.com",1
"the quality of the lecture is poor - slides are dense and full of bullet points which the professor LITERALLY JUST READS OUT on videos. I did a google search, and found almost all of the analytical charts he presented, readily available on the internet. What exactly is the point in the lecture then? Instead, why don't you compress some valuable learning nuggets into half the course time, instead of hearing you ready through your ocean of bullet points, and needlessly underline (in red) the current bullet point your reading. Seriously, this is one the poorest quality lectures I've ever done!The quality of peer assignments to grade are a joke. Classmates are simply copying bits and pieces of the lecture material to make up the 'market sizing memo'.I seriously doubt the learning value in this class, and the quality of instruction.",1
This is real boring I just learned that,1
"It is very interesting, but we have to face problems with Teradata, I have not been able even to log in, and a lot of students are in the same situation, and the problem persists, even in the duedate of the test.",1
Each week is a very light overview of a topic. There is little to no connection between the topics. The course is not rigorous enough. I felt at the end of the course I didn't learn anything.,1
"The marking scheme for essays is filth ! I was not even informed what the passing mark is before I received my grade ,all the instructions for assignments are absurdly unclear! Also the "" professor "" 's English is terrible.",1
Nothing new and no challenging exercises. It could be more interactive,1
I don't know what is the problem as I study the videos well and when it come to taking quiz i never pass so I watch the videos over and aver again but it always the same resultthe part of other languages I'm not sure what is the point of it I mean does it help in English to know how to say for example hi in other languages plz if anyone passed the course . could u plz help me,1
very bad and not organised,1
This course gives good perspective on innovation process and how to bring idea to life. However it was disappointing to me that content of the course has nothing to do with Art and Culture.,1
It's a very dry course. The material is very limited and the coverage has to be more lively with some some relevant examples.,1
"It is like for kids, I think all courses must mention their target audience. Contents, Videos, talks nothing was value for time.",1
"I couldn't get passed the Starbuck assignment, I don't really understand why the choose such a bad application of digital marketing.",1
Dato tool does not even install properly.. so n´makes no sense to continue with the course. The support team fail to help in installing ... :-(,1
Completely useless. Just a number of boring videos of what you may possibly learn in Data Science Specialization.,1
Maybe I was wrong but I expected more medical course with many practical examples and the course is sth like 'explore your creativity in the field and be prepared'.,1
Terrible course. Assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures. Mentors are not active. Explanations are sketchy and not well paced. Do this course only for the examples in the Jupyter notebook.,1
"Rather uninteresting presentation. I found it hard to become interested in the course or Kierkegaard after having high hopes of truly enjoying it. The best parts of the lectures were when the instructor was taped at venues pertinent to the course. The peer reviewers were not always fair, in my opinion. I'd spend my time elsewhere, personally, especially since this course was something for my own personal edification and not a requirement.",1
I expected something else.,1
The material is not mature yet. Some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work. Questions asked on the forums about it got no answers before the end of the course.,1
"Tutors reading from a teleprompter comes across as robotic, lifeless and boring. We should be told before we do a piece of work that we can only submit it by upgrading, not afterwards!",1
I can't reach the course contents because of new deadline that Coursera has invented,1
"Disappointed with lectures-structured data rather than real life examples-professor is speaking monotonously, without passion-no visualisation on the discussed topic",1
The teacher is boring,1
"A course graded only by your peers ! what's the point ? Well the peers that graded my answers are not qualified to grade my work, useless, wast of time grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.",1
Could have been much better ....should have been a proper video tutorial,1
"only theory no practice. I don't need math at this point as I don't know even how to build simple machine learning program. Programming assignments come with no explanation. It is not possible to finish this course without learning from other sources on the web, materials attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject. I have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course.",1
Scattered lectures that are hard to follow and choppy,1
"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Graded assignments require a lot of self-education.",1
"I'm honestly quite pissed. The material itself is fine but I have had a terrible experience working with the instructors. I don't think I will continue taking these courses.I don't appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help. First of all, I don't know WHY I'm failing the test cases, I just am. Your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first 3. But then, I try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed. Quite frankly, I have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and I've created my own tests and I have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and I still have no clue what to do. I have school, a job, and yet I'm losing all this productivity because I'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that I catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code. All I want is real, concrete feedback.",1
"After about one hour the only things I learnt is to do ""stuff"" in different way (too vague concept) and the basic of photography.",1
Auditing is pretty useless with how this class is updated. I can't get peer reviews so my assignments get zero feedback. Coursera didn't used to be like this.Asked about how to be more involved in class discussions and peer reviews a couple days ago and haven't received feedback.,1
Should state up front that there is no auditing. Unable to continue this course without Upgrading.,1
"Complex concepts (e.g., regression), which cannot be taught in such a short course format (I know from extensive prior training), are taught here in an arcane way. I don't know how students without prior knowledge on these topics (e.g., regression, ROC curve analysis) could possibly understand this when taught this way.Course is also in an 'early draft' mode, with plenty of mistakes in the videos/slides. The course (and specialization) really tarnishes - instead of enhancing - this institution's outside image and reputation.Really a deception; sorry I took this class and specialization, a complete waste of my time and money. The initial presentation was misleading (and I have found online many people sharing the same feeling).",1
Very bad or non-existent support,1
"I think this course is great, I like everything about it, but I can't say the same about the quiz format, it is rigid and non-standardI gave up on the course many times because of thisHow do write Sqrt(5) for instance ? 5x must be 5*x or it is not acceptable.I am sorry, this is pretty bad",1
followed instructions to download twice waste of time both times still kept getting an error never got past this to continue with the course so didn't learn anything other than there is little support out there to resolve the problem i think because the course is not monitored or if it is well then more fool me! it would have been a good opportunity to explore this had it been possible to download Unity oh well those who can do those who can't resume their day to day life packing boxes.,1
"The exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff, then push you off. No guidance. Good luck if you don't already know linear algebra, matrix math, and matlab. I'll be looking elsewhere to learn about Machine Learning. Glad I didn't pay for this course!",1
"not too good ,,because in assignments session they doesnt know what the right ans is, as in first assignment ,the ques is about circumference of circle as in google the exact ans is what they wronged it",1
The instructor rambled on when back on forth on topics and numbers too much and made the videos much longer than they needed to be. Some of the information is badly outdated like the electric vehicle driving range and hybrid vehicles only able to drive a mile with ou,1
"I feel robbed. I did not get any feedback on my work. Only a classmate gave their ok ""yes, there is something written"".I did not follow the course to get a ""certificate"" but to learn and to revceive feedback. If you don't have a special purpose for the certificate - don't pay a cent for this.",1
"The lesson is really boring , and the lecturer just reads the slides. And there is no any interaction on the slides, or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence. Just read it through. I am enough of this kind of lesson.",1
"The course are fantastic but 3 month HARD WORKING to earn a ""cheap"" certificate that looks false :( I cannot present it to my company",1
The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.,1
"I was really disappointed in this ""course"" for several reasons. I did not complete it, because it was really not worth spending time on. The organizer impressed me as only wanting to sell copies of his book on dog behavior and used the course as his vehicle. Then there were games to ""purchase"" online to facilitate teaching my dog cognitive skills. The videos were lacking in creativity. I was really disappointed with this, especially since its a cool topic that could easily be presented in a very exciting way. The artistic level, the videos, slides, etc were something a high school student could pull together. After taking solid courses like ModPo and Positive Psychology, I was amazed at the lack of effort that was put into this.",1
"I have to apologize this course was so out of date. Yes, I learned a few things, but the recommended reading was from 2010 and 2011. One of the assignments was about an app that no longer exists. Had I not already purchased multiple classes I don't think I would continue on. I hope the next classes are more up-to-date.",1
"Not recommended at all. She gets some things right, but really wastes the opportunity to drill the most fundamental and important point about philanthropy: namely, that the most important factor in assessing a non-profit's value is effectiveness, and non-profits vary in their effectiveness by many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a small number of Charity Evaluators and Meta charities have identified those charities which most effectively address the most common values of aspiring philanthropists.I don't recommend this course for anyone. Rather, I would strongly encourage anyone seriously interested Giving to check out Peter Singer's course, ""Effective Altruism"".",1
"Unfortunately, without a doubt, the worst und most uninformative course I've ever taken. Apart from stating the obvious nothing new. A lot of repetition of ""useless"" information. Super disappointed. Can't believe that such a course is offered here and that I really paid for nothing of such quality.",1
The material is very unclear.,1
"The material is very randomized, and the instructor presents it in an overly complex way.",1
"It is a very small introduction to swift, while the last assignment expects you to be rather fluent in programming using swift. A lot of self study using the guides provided by apple and other sources is needed to successfully complete this course.Furthermore the video's indicate a lack of preparedness on part of the instructors as a lot of sentences are cut of halfway , then started a new with a new goal. All of which makes this course very hard to understand. For free it is passable, but had I payed I would sincerely regret itPart 2 is better, but still changing thoughts midway in a sentence",1
"The structure is not clear, with similar ideas coming up several times. Examples can be far-fetched (Britannica for ethical blindness ?). The teachers read the script and sometimes stumble on the words. An idea is explained in 3 minutes when 30s are enough. I am getting bored and very disappointed because it is a very important topics these days. I quit. Thank you anyways",1
This is a very bad course,1
"Not very helpful, very stessfull music and only read definitions, do discussion or explanations to go deeper into the topic.",1
Why dont you open week2 and rest of the weeks ?? Why the hell are you blocking my learning until ???,1
"I an very disappointed that DUKE hits your up for $79 just to grade the fist quiz (which should cost them $0). This is the fist time I have seen an Institution do this. I can understand charging for a certificate, or for a Final project, but not right out of the gate. I hope that the spirit of Coursera is not changing to a ""pay to play"" site. There are other higher rated Universities that take a more noble approach. I wonder if all the reviewers paid $79 day 1 for this class, or did DUKE recently changed their pricing policy after the reviews...",1
Not interesting.To many examples about russian emitents,1
"I have done the course but I didn't get my certificate yet for reasons that I don,t know.",1
Whilst I can see why the idea of reproducible research is important there was't really enough material in this course for the full four weeks - and in fact a lot of the videos repeated the same information.,1
"I wrote some indepth feedback, but par for the course, I can't save it - either here or on the discussion board. Nothing obscene, but certainly some major frustration with format, inconsistencies in scoring and format, information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes, the fact that Coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty, the lack of ANY moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance...and can go on with the technical issues to but I won't!",1
"This course was required by my director, but it is not for those who have no background in law (which was the case for the group of us at CDC who were required to take this). It was very difficult to iuinderstand and I did not think it was a ""beginner's course for no",1
"The course content is okay and covers the basics well enough. However, the assignments are structured for memorization not learning and contribute little to the experience. I decided to cancel my subscription as there are better options on EdX and other Coursera courses.",1
"The other modules that I have done in this specialisation have been great. The lecturers are insightful and the courses have been at the right pace. This particular module was flat, to say the least. I paid €43 to learn a small amount of markdown syntax, and the quizzes and the weeks didn't even match up!",1
The course is essentially just a review of formulas with very little intuition explained to the beginner. It was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts. This course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a student's intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses. A fundamental demonstration of how to use R to work through regression models (starting from square one) should be added so that this becomes a self-contained course. As it currently stands it is a collection of poorly integrated slides and concepts that serve to confuse the student more than educate. Other classes teach this material infinitely better.,1
No content for the first two weeks. Only links to websites.,1
*No Stars*Another boring animal class that I would not recommend. The teachers do seem nice and well educated however it is still too boring and slow for me.,1
"It's a shame that almost all courses are to be paid for nowadays. For one, I am not paying for it, many will follow...",1
"I have always loved the Coursera courses that I have taken, but this one is dramatically below the standard. It is lacking in terms of content, pedagogy, and production. I truly hope that this isn't the direction that Coursera is headed in, as this class seems more like a cheap self-help seminar than an academic course of study.",1
"The given introduction didn't help me to figure out how the grading system will look like. There are no assignments to submit, only online group works, which is not organised well at all. There are too many threads and the it's not at all clear what to write about. Apparently I should write about certain cases, but I couldn't find the content of the case. There is no proper introduction, work overview or anything. Very dissapointing.",1
The whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn. I am not from an IT background but still found it very useful. However the capstone was a bit of disappointment. I believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the Capstone projects for my better understanding. The whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification I believe there should be some professional help too. I even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available. I ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either. The course content for operation analytics and People Analytics were indeed very useful. Thanks.,1
"Nothing to do with IoT, misleading title and waste of time, apart from several incorrections in the novel narration.",1
Very hard for a beginner. Lacks the slow build up I needed. Missing an explanation about a comma cost me about 4 hours. The assignments are brutal which encourages cheating.,1
"Terrible course compared to all others I've seen on Coursera.Content is scarce, quality is low, maybe okay for college graduates, but being in business, it's just too slim.Video quality is also terrible. Don't waste 35$",1
Basically a couple of guys have an unorganized discussion about swift. Little to no organization with poor coordination between lectures and quizzes.. Appears that there is no TA or course staff monitoring discussion boards... I am glad I didn't pay for the class... Disappointed though because I really wanted to learn Swift.,1
Lousy course.....boring teacher,1
Nothing is making sense. None of the videos are related to the quiz. None of the examples are remotely related to the quiz to even give you a suggestion on how to solve them.,1
"I am disappointed in the quality of the lectures in this course. They're too summarized -- too quick-- and they lack the thoroughness required to accurately convey the intuition the student needs to comprehend the lessons taught. When I have to spend a significant number of hours watching lectures on YouTube to compensate for the poor quality lectures offered in ""Understand Financial Markets"", I am left wondering why I enrolled in the specialization. I think Coursera needs to have a conversation with the professors at Geneva University about the need for prerequisites before allowing students to enroll in this specialization.",1
"Material is very high level. No ppt's are given, so all links presented in the video's cannot be viewed.Quizzes are based upon old packages, so incorrect answers are provided.No replies at discussion board from TA""s or instructors.",1
Course Academy and historic,1
"It was the worse experience I have so far on Coursera Platform; the course itself was sloppy and with nearly zero content. The instructors spent too much time telling you what you will learn and talking too slowly as if wanting to fill in the gaps than actually having some worthy material prepared for all the ""pupils"" out there, who gave their time, effort, and commitment. Pity really.",1
"I would like to give this course worse than a 1 star. The course explanations are very poor. The explanations drag on and make no sense. I had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the videos were discussing, which I felt like defeats the purpose. Why am I paying for something when I have to use other sources to better explain. I would never recommend this course to anyone. Listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me. I like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow. Each instructor got worse and worse! The videos were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse! I feel robbed from taking this course. I should have asked for my refund within the first week, but I felt since I was paying, I would stick it out a little longer. You will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject. Very useless course. Hated every week of this course and I wouldn't dare to continue with the full specialization program. It's very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot, but it missed it's mark completely.",1
"The quiz and assignment are poorly designed. Important issues are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture. The assignment focuses on matlab coding, which only emphasizes the coding technique. Do not recommend to audience with",1
Stunning waste of time. There is nothing of substance.,1
"Overall the videos related to the quizzes are to vague and un detailed, I more often than not feel lost.Also this should not be part of the interaction design specialisation, and just be a small part of another course.Not once have I needed R or statistic in my 7 year design career.",1
Teaching behaviourism in 2017 is scandalous.,1
complier error all the time!!!!!!,1
The Professor is very slow and boring.,1
"Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed, even if you submit before deadline. Course content is not substantiated with research. Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned, which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessions.The person responsible for the course should take the following actions:1) Aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions2) Clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed. I estimate that there are 50-100 still pending review, many were submitted almost one year ago.",1
Totally disappointed!,1
The pronunciation of the lectors is more than awful! Their English is quite unsuitable for video lectures! So I quit the course. It is just a torture listening to them!,1
"I've already written a review but it seems to have been removed...This is an awful course, there is very little purpose to it whatsoever, it is basically a module in markdown which will in all honesty not have much application for most learners.In addition, the course is not at all balanced / laid out well, there is a peer assignment in week 1, which you need to have covered week 2's content for.Lastly, the recording quality of some of the lectures is awful, it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for Coursera.In all honesty, this entire specialisation is of awful quality, it is not a data science course, it is a ""here's a few useful things in R"" course, and the instructors should be ashamed that their institution makes money from it.",1
"Outdated and unsupported !The code for the exercises was made for Eclipse ADT and Google dropped support for Eclipse a while ago. The official IDE for Android development is Android Studio now.I could import the project for Lab1 but I'm unable to compile the tests and the program with Android Studio, I get a ton of errors. My post in the forums about this is unanswered for 3 days now.",1
They jump around too much and it is very hard to follow. Often I feel like I missed out on content.,1
Way too much reading material. Not enough video lectures/ explanations. The professor also needs to speak a little slower for people to follow.,1
"Its really hard to communicate with Coursera. I have paid for the course, havent enrolled due to my illness and there is nobody who can help me out with this.Its a very nice project ""Coursera"" but still has too much to make up... what a pity.Martin",1
"Absolutely U-S-E-L-E-S-S, at least in the free version.",1
The instructor is very annoying and he talks way too much about non important stuff.,1
"Where is the actual information ,are some parts missing , are they payed ? useless",1
I think that the simply reading slides doesn't help people understand. The idea is to make this courses as accessible as possible.,1
I feel like it should have been mentioned a lot clearer before starting that this was simply a course in how to use the creators library. These skills are not transferable anywhere else as I would have to pay to use them in future! Would have been a lot more useful as a how to for sci-kit and pandas.,1
All this peer grading nonsense is garbage. If we are gonna pay 63$ a month of something we can at least get the proper grading system included.,1
The assignments and weekly work is by far much more than the hours estimated. Finally I feel as I didn't learn anything.,1
"The material and videos are so poor, and low quality, I am happy to not have bought this course",1
"Worst course I have ever seen on Coursera. Such a shame, as the subject is very exciting, and the 'lectures' in the first couple of weeks are a monotonous jabble.",1
"This course is not well-presented. Lectures are unimaginative, and there isn't enough supporting material or readings.",1
"If I could, I would rate it 0/5 stars.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT pay and enroll this course. And you will be disappointed if you do. There, now you have been warned.This part of the specialization has been put together in a haste, without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching. I'm completely shocked and disappointed.In other words:It is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a MOOC. Shame on you University of Toronto!Yes, harsh words, and here's why:The course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment. Face tracking? That's pretty far from what I expected from this when I paid $284 for the specialization.In total, there is only 25minutes of video lectures. Really? That's it? It's way too little for a capstone project course.Staff does not care about learners's concerns. Zero effort to respond in the discussion forums. It takes days before there is any response at all.The assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague. Why are we doing face tracking when the description talks about location apis and ""putting it all together""?",1
"Great material. Some things I didn't know about disabilities and colleges, however the presentation of the videos that were not of a guest speaker were poorly done. The instructors sounded like robots and you could tell easily that they were just reading from a script.",1
"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a ""shortcut"" package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera.",1
"Although the content is interesting, I would have liked it better had the content and the instructor been a little more engaging.",1
The worst that I have taken so far... please change the teacher or re-do the materials explaining the concepts more!.Or at least give more extra material to understand the concepts better.,1
"This is a lousy course.The subject and material could be interesting; however, the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic's cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you've understood the key points of the lectures!While this course was a timed release (implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week, it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students.This has got to be the worst Coursera course I have taken and I have taken quite a few.",1
"got to pay, but besides that it's more about him talking less learning about anything",1
Lectures are in Hebrew. English subtitles are in Hebrew also. Completely useless unless you understand Hebrew. I am about to drop this class.,1
Not worth your time or money.,1
nothing i can say that made me jump for joy. i fell asleep half the time.,1
"I really wonder why this should be a course at an University. It's just some sort of fact-dump of Android and iOS, which ist current, but will be outdated within four weeks (seriously).So, to keep up with this issue, it's just better to read some blogs about this or type ""ios vs android"" in Google.",1
"This course is quite outdated. I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started. The Spark courses from edX are way better than these. Hopefully ""Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark"" from the ""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.Many of the videos, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over. They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... ""teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh...."". Gosh, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).The Kaggle competition at the end of the course can be fun if you do the hard work, but you don't need to put much of an effort to pass. I know that the submissions I peer reviewed were quite poor, but the grading criteria that we need to follow as reviewers is quite vague and not very thorough. You also run the risk of getting a lesser grade than you deserve because your reviewer is incompetent, which is a bummer... At the moment the course has very few people taking it (the same people I peer reviewed, also reviewed me, which leads to me to believe that maybe only 3 or 4 people were taking this course during the November 2016 iteration).",1
Beware - will make you upgrade to complete quizzes (and pay) - should definitely be much more upfront about this from the beginning.Seems like very poor tactics on their behalf.,1
The professor just read the slides (and most of the slide and content are repetitive.) The content of the entire course can be studied in less than 3 hour (so did the other courses of this Specialization.) It's not a good course and I think it's not worth to purchase these classes.,1
This course is really bad. The instruction is not enough to solve the programming assignment. The almost contents aren't related to communicating data science result.,1
"I have found this a deeply frustrating experience. The main lecturer, Professor Adam Gearey, clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communicator. His lectures are poorly constructed, repetitious and sometimes confusing. He seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture: as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself, for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the High Court rather than the Crown Court, and these errors have not been picked up and corrected. I am forced to wonder whether anybody in the University of London team bothered to quality check these videos. These problems are compounded by the uncorrected subtitles and 'transcripts' of the lectures, obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject. It is also frustrating that when I raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum, I received replies from a volunteer moderator which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible. This moderator made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion, but told me that 'you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him' and that I should 'read the sentence properly': in other words, no criticism, however constructive, can be tolerated. Even some of the questions in the quizzes are carelessly constructed: for example, the 'correct' answer to q8 in the final quiz uses the word 'allowed' (which implies an element of discretion) instead of 'required', which would have properly reflected the provision in question (s.6 HRA 1998 - 'the authority could not have acted differently' ). All in all, the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards I expected from a university with London's reputation.",1
"Good introduction to the galaxy tool. However, the final project was too difficult for what was given in the lectures. I spent 97% of the time I spent on the course doing only the final project. It was too difficult and unfair. I think a way to improve the final project might be to make easier a little bit and give exclusive lectures to help students to do the final project.",1
"I learned eight lines of Java code in four weeks, and we never implemented any of it into a web application (viz, a script that actually runs in a live website). Read a book instead. It's cheaper, takes about the same amount of time, and you learn a lot more. I gave it a star because one was the minimum. It should be zero because it wasted my time.",1
It's better to watch the Youtube videos to understand the concepts.,1
"Unnecessary extra videos, that could and should be joined together. In particular, in lessons 2 and 3 all ""topic introductions"" could be joined with the following ""let's discuss this topic inside a DAW"" video.Awful dynamic range. In some videos voice of lector is very quiet (-20 dB or less) and sound played from the DAW is much louder (around -6 dB). In other videos, the opposite: loud lector and quiet DAW. Change of microphone setup between intro video and ""in the DAW"" video is also very noticeable and distracting.Repeats of repeats over repeats. This is not needed at all. I could repeat everything by myself, just pause video and replay interesting fragment. I don't need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track. Yes, It should be done from time to time, but not each time. These repeats make the lessons unnecessary long, it feels I could have been told the same information in half of time or less.This combines with very slow pace of a lector. I listened all lessons on 1.5 or even 2.0 tempo, just to not fall asleep.Quizzes are strange. Stupid quesion appeared in quiz three: which key combinations we use in the videos? But why do you ever ask this, how this relates to the topic? I use another DAW in another OS, I even don't have a ""command"" key, I could have changed my hot keys, so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me. I was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune, how it sounds and alike, not this particular crap. Trust me, anyone could figure which hot keys to use. I am not just a monkey, I have an ability to explore my software by myself, I don't need to be told how to copy and paste, and even if I need this I just go look in the manual.",1
"If you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series I suggest you look elsewhere. I was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used. Don't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.**My initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the 2nd course of this specialization I have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together.",1
"The lectures are very good, but the course administrators forgot to proof read the quizzes. Evidently some questions have been deleted and the result is complete nonsense. the lectures are worth listening to, and I did that with some interest, but as a course, the administrators have failed.",1
"This course totally reminds me of some courses back in college: unorganized material and the assignments are unrelated to the tutorial. The assignments themselves seem to be very helpful but the tutorials did no help of achieving these assignments.I had a hard time following the instructor despite that I've completed all the certificate for python from University of Michigan. I'm aware of my background of python is still not strong enough so I thought it's probably just me not able to learn it fast enough.But then I watched the tutorial about SQL. As a data architect / ETL developer, SQL is something I'm familiar with and use it everyday and then I realized that the instructor couldn't explain a nested query well. The reason I was able to understand about the SQL part is because I already know.",1
exam questions are designed for raw facts instead of critical thinking and resoning. Sorry maybe its my poor english. Regards.,1
nothing new,1
It is a poor propaganda for religious. It even claims that creationism should be regarded as a viable alternative to evolution!,1
"The class format -- only quizzes during most weeks, no programming work, then ending with a *huge* programming assignment -- is really poor pedagogical technique. If you're going to teach programming, have programming assignments *every* *week*, instead of dropping a massive assignment at the very end of the course.",1
"For an introductory course with no prerequisites, the assignments should cover material that has been introduced in lectures. Non-introductory and advanced courses in R can require students to look outside of lectures for completing relatively complex problems.",1
"There is a lot of fluff in this course and at the same time it assumes that you have knowledge and skills that are not covered in this course or in the previous two (e.g. github). I'm really disappointed in the quality of this course--specifically at how vague many of the instructions were in the quiz questions and the final project-- and that most the time when explanations were asked for on the message board the professors just did some hand waving and said that figuring it out was part of the assignment. That isn't teaching (online or otherwise). And if your instructions aren't clear, you aren't doing the job of an instructor when you pass the buck and try to sell it as ""part of the learning experience."" I hope this fall off in quality isn't reflective of the rest of the courses in the data spec.",1
Horrible class. Shame it's in the series.,1
Staff are incredibly arrogant bordering on aggressive. The very worst of the pontificating profession - and what we long term learners and educators know to be all too common. I couldn't stand it so I stopped. Would never recommend.,1
"Only the most basic of instructions for R, which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources. There are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within. The quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived. Not worth the money!",1
"Completely not what I've expected, too theoretical without examples and explanations..",1
"Need a good foundation with knowledge of calculus(integrals), electrical engineering and wave and acoustics. Not just a course to pick up for fun.",1
homework is badly designed. it covers too little materials,1
Frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course nu-necessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities.,1
"The proffessor only reads the slides and do nothing more. No technical explanation included, only some keyword provided.",1
"Homework, lectures, and the quiz are completely out of sync. Bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else. Things appear on the quiz that aren't in the home work or lecture. This was put together from scraps of another lecture, but in an incoherent fashion. When Caffo tells the viewer that they'll need to use other resources, he wasn't kidding. I dropped this the first time when I kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced, took another stats class, then came back and aced it. I don't mind accelerated learning or using other resources, but there's guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found. This leaves little recourse but to know stats already, or go learn it before taking this course. Otherwise you don't know enough to even go find the pieces you need. Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more. If that's the case, I can't say enough good things about Biostatistical Analysis by Zar but thoroughly, logically categorizing statistical methods with short, clear examples, references to the original research, and building up one concept after another in logical order. The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class. As it is, Caffo's presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling, but there's no indication that it'll match what Khan Academy did regardless of how much work goes in. At best, it's a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts.",1
"In just the first 2 weeks I found several quiz questions that are not correct. Example code in quizzes is not complete. Spacing and indentation are incorrect in quiz samples(I realize this is probably to prevent copy paste testing of code, but you cannot answer is this code correct if you don't know where they wanted indentation to line up). Lecture presentation is not very engaging, almost seems like the female instructor was forced to stand in front of a camera and read note cards. Withdrew early.",1
Not so helpful. This generation already is familiar with everything taught here. Withdrawing the Honor Code Certification is so unethical. Not going to take any courses from Coursera from now on.,1
"This course starts very simply with data clean up (almost too simply!), but then goes DEEP into the weeds of regression and fails to explain how to apply these complex concepts to any real world application. For example, if I build a regression model, how might I use it in my analytics role at work and explain the results to my stakeholders? How do i interpret the results of the regression for making informed business decisions? How do I predict an outcome with a Tree or Neural Network? I found the instructor very hard to follow/understand (thank goodness for the written transcripts). He's clearly extremely intelligent, but fails to relate these concepts to the student in order for the student to take away anything more than ""These complex concepts and tools exist.""",1
Less useful than reading an introductory chapter. Being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field. The minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing.,1
"The title of this course is Paradoxes of War. One of the paradoxes is how little paradox there is in war, after reviewing and reflecting on the lectures and the reading materials.",1
"This is an extremely basic course. Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized. So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.g. elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.",1
I can't have my certirficate and already I pay for it!,1
"Its ok. HTML is not ""Code"" its a Mark-Up Language. When she cant explain sheo covers it up with attitude words or skips quickly.",1
The lecture just reads books.,1
This course does not meet my needs and expectations. The content is very focused on engineering projects. The exercise demands a lot of time to understand the document. It would be better to slice it in many exercises associated with each week.,1
I wish this course was for free with the assignments!,1
"Study material DOES NOT cover tested material appropriately. For those quizzes I took, I ended up doing them by trial and error. Took one of them seven times just changing answers. Quiz 3 is so ambiguous that I am giving up.",1
"It uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure Python programming learning, jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python. I would not recommend this course for beginners in programming.",1
In Lectures rate of speech is really fast and in some presentations are not clear,1
I thought this course would be more fun and interesting but I find it VERY repetitive with the Fundamentals of Graphic Design. If you buy the package it kind of seems like I wasted $79 dollars on a repetitive and monotone professor and course. I would not recommend this course within the specialization.,1
This course was way too basic. The instructor basically just gave us links to existing web content. Very disappointed in the course. It felt like the instructor was lazy to develop a real curriculum.,1
"The entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". There are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. The assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. It's optional. Then the actual assignment is ""Do this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. All you did was write down what they told you to and where. You never actually build anything yourself. You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.The quizzes are also pointless. Every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply. There's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE. The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to. They are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again. I would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it.",1
"As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers! (Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.)I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare. It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners.Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned.The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials. In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code.There is a desperate need for a glossary. The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...). If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same.Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill.As for ""We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each,"" that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch.I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions). And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn. The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call ""The Curse of Knowledge"" -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not.My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else. Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment. I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course.My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization. They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education. (Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.)My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course. Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money! This is especially important if the course has not actually started. This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way!After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project. This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time. So, I decided to end the nightmare, and I'm glad it's over!",1
"Poor visual aids, course content and format.",1
"The peer reviewed assignments are next to useless, as there is no oversight on them. I think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first, before allowing fellow learners the ability to pass/fail students in the course.",1
Not much useful. Limited in interactivity. Dropped out after a week and half,1
not well prepared course,1
"weather its an act of self-interests or not, I don't really care. fact is after viewing few videos into the starting point where the legit content should appear, I decided to stop; it is a waste of my time.he is either not teaching and providing the real solutions or he doesn't really know much; full of trash talk in generality, negativity on points of view, and outdated methodology that is not practical in the 21st century.I have proof to my review.",1
"Horrible, endless rambling, no solutions to the quiz questions (unlike cal 1 course). sucks all the fun out of math, avoid this course, find an alternative where you can learn more with less time spent watching him write out 20 numbers.",1
"Just following a text book, without an added value from the lectures.",1
"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution.The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code.Overall I am very disappointed with this course. There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good.",1
"I am very disappointed with this course I had to wait too long on grading, first time I got not naff points then I had to wait for about few months on grading. I will not take capstone for this course because I suppose I would wait about a few years on grading. This course has to change grading process because has no adequate number of students for peer review.",1
Too general course. Didn't learn much from it.,1
Course did not meet my expectations. I would not have paid the $80 for it knowing what I know now. I also found the lectures to be not very helpful.,1
very boring and uninteresting delivery..,1
This course needs too much C/C++ knowledge and the test are far too code oriented. You have to give textual answers without having enough help for memory calculation.,1
"A very weak course, gives very little knowledge of grammar, doesn't really explain quite a lot of things. If you are a first year primary school student, this course might be helpful, otherwise a complete waste of time.",1
"This course has nothing to do with ""emerging technologies."" The course is essentially a quick history of Android and iOS smartphones that could be learned by browsing Wikipedia.",1
HTML and CSS is good. JS search for another course.,1
bad instructor,1
It has too many bugs.,1
"The course and specialization looks promising but I get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments. Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded.",1
"That's terrible! I can't see any English subtitles added to this course. Besides, tests are not relevant to the content taught in the video.",1
"Really bad course. Badly taught, strange choice of assignments and quiz questions. Unfortunately, I did the free trial and Coursera didn't process my cancellation so that I had to pay for a whole month for this.Complete waste of time AND(!!!) money!",1
boring,1
I could not upload a correct video as I do not have the knowledge to do so but I didnot get to finish the course which I think is unfair. There should be some other ways of uploading the homework. I have given two stars not because the course is not good but because I was unfairly given less marks and as below70% is not passed did not get to complete the course,1
"The course material was interesting, but the TOTAL lack of support forces me to give it only one star. I left the following complaint in the general forum for this course 2 months ago. Neither Coursera, the instructor or any moderator ever responded. Many people were not able to run the software supplied in the course because of bugs, but the solution was left to the student. I have taken good courses on line before, but this is not one of them.It seems that the Dr. Tucker Balch and/or the moderators have totally abandoned this course, but Coursera keeps offering it and collecting money.The neither instructor or nor the moderators have posted on the Meet and Greet Forum.The instructor and/or moderators have ANSWERED NO QUESTIONS posted on ANY forum.The QSTK (software) BUGS have NOT BEEN ADDRESSED by the instructor or the moderators. Only students have answered these forum questions.""Computational Investing Part II is coming shortly."" That is what they said 3 years ago. Further evidence of abandonment.",1

NEEEEEED TO EDIT MY PEER REVIEW FROM OTHERS,1
"Important material, poorly taught.",1
"Seeking out supplemental material is not only helpful, but necessary. This course does not provide a foundation of knowledge for inferential statistics so much as present several equations and functions and describe how one might use them.",1
"If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week). The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all.",1
"Honestly not a very well designed course. I went through the videos and tests for weeks 1 and 2 and found that it's just rushing us through the basics while not really telling us much. Much of it was ""here's an introduction to a tiny detail... You go find out the rest""..",1
unclear and poorly thought out,1
Too many bugs with Coursera. Issues occur with submissions. System indicates submissions were successfully submitted. Then when you log back in it indicates your assignment is over due. Now I can't,1
"The first few weeks are truly beginner/intro course stuff and the entire course is well taught. However, weeks 4-7 ramp up at far too fast of a pace. I spent 8-10 hours every week trying to keep up and it just moved too fast. The instructor was doing things at breakneck speed with little explanation. It gets very discouraging by the end because you simply can't play the material. I think this course is really for people who are re-learning guitar or already have musical backgrounds.",1
"The sequence of the learning movie are not good and some times while teaching the the movie is ended.Besides, rather than educational material this course refer to several website.",1
"The course may be great, but the sound of the video is really terrible, this is a big problem for me and possibly to other users, at the point where I decided to stop watching.Please do something about it !",1
"The first three courses in this Duke series were superbly well done. I have taken numerous courses from Harvard and Johns Hopkins, and none of them compare in quality of execution of the first three Duke courses in this series.And then there was Bayesian Statistics: much of the ""instruction"" in this course was truly awful. The quality of the slides and video and so on was still excellent, but the ""teaching"" was horrible. Vast amounts of totally unexplained jargon and very extensive equations were thrown at the students with the apparent assumption that the course was a review for postdoctoral statistics students. When material is beyond the scope of what perspective students can reasonably be expected to understand, faculty members should be honest enough to just say so rather than pretending to teach the subject matter.I appreciate very much what the Duke faculty achieved in the first three courses, but the treatment of Bayesian statistics that I have just suffered through was shameful.",1
this course was a waste of my time; luckily I found out after wasting only 6 hours on the preview. this course apparently requires a level of probability knowledge I don't,1
Terrible. Nobody seems to monitor the forum. No response to questions posted.I want to rate zero but there is no such option available.,1
"Generic history information, nothing to teach really. completed the tests about ios and android without even watching the videos.",1
"BEWARE. If you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding, this course will be very confusing, totally unpractical, and you'll walk away not feeling like you've really learned how to use R in a real way.I was incredibly disappointed.",1
The lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about Jefferson. There is nothing academic about this course.,1
The course is very superficial in nature and there is no difficulty...,1
They shouldn't compact 14+ videos in one week.,1
"Quizzes were based off of extremely high level overview videos not covering anything specifically or deep diving into anything. When applying the git commands covered, numerous errors arose. Overwhelmingly academic course with very little hands on. This is not for anyone actually looking to work in this field, but for someone looking to be able to talk about this field.",1
Not useful at all if it's audited.,1
"Objective and Professional Evaluation:If I could give this course a zero, I would have done so, but it is not possible. I shall explain my reasons below:1- The teaching method of this course is very lackadaisical and lackluster.2- The ratios are introduced and solved without having a P/L statement or a Balance Sheet on the side to see how the figures are extracted and implemented, which made it more boring.3- Its final 3-part quiz lacks the proper instructions and the redundant instructions already there do not help either. For example, it says Part 3 is answering NPV. However, Part 3 includes six calculation questions unrelated to the project to be submitted in Parts 1 and 2.4- The forms of putting an answer are unclear, although it mentions how to put a percentage and two decimal points.5- Peer assessment take ages and is unnecessary.6- Discussion forums are deserted islands where no professional staff interaction is given.I've stopped continuing this specialization and I strongly recommend others not to waste their time on it.",1
"If I can understand all of these derivatives, why shall I attend your course? It is not helpful course, especially for persons looking for some practical econometrics applications rather than focusing on the mathematics side of it.",1
"A jurassic park image, with material you can read by yourself?",1
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).,1
Very poor Server capacity. Problematic to complete assignments,1
"The concept of the course is excellent--short videos, quizzes, activity. The execution is extremely poor--the short quizzes often do not emphasize the elements focused upon in the video OR ask questions addressed in the next video (not the one just viewed) OR address issues that are not raised at all in this particular course (but issues from other courses in the specialization). One is penalized for being late with assignments and must shift to a new session if one is late. The weekly tests are absolutely ridiculous--they ask questions requiring the application of concepts which were barely covered, concepts which were not reviewed, or which require real world knowledge which cannot be assumed for someone who has no experience in this field.",1
No passion is on his lecture. There is only dryness and ethical superior pride through his theory.. Altruism without love is an empty vanity and well-designed commercial intention for selling his theory.,1
concepts on prospect theory is not explained correctly,1
Goes waaaay too fast to actually learn anything. Not very useful.,1
italian accent is way too strong.,1
"Take this course if you want to get depressed out of ever learning any programming.The structure is this:-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-a gigantic task where you don't actually use half of the material from before, but instead need to use some material from the future module or from just googling things.You never get to understand why what you wrote didn't work and why it should be the way your classmate wrote it.The course makers don't seem to be interested in your feedback.",1
"All lecture, no use of media",1
"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1
"Wow that was a waste of my time.So many broken elements, mistakes etc. Last minute rush job putting this course together.",1
"This course has great videos. I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems. This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400.",1
"Instructor, Dr. Chuck, is terrific. However, assignments are incredibly difficult. You are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course. I spent over 100 hours alone on the assignments. The mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all. Very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments",1
I submitted homework for week 1. I get an email telling me I did not submit. Then week two the course makes references to material not covered in week 1. it looks like a week is missing between week 1 and week 2?,1
This course is based on personal anecdotes and not facts. Many of the examples provided have been proven to be farces and/or practical jokes.,1
"Terrible course: (i) the lecturer seems to be ""all over the place"", briefly touching on several aspects of finance in a superficial way, without much coherence with respect to each week's theme; (ii) the lecturer speaks in a very confusing way, without formulating clear sentences and often divagating from the main topic with minor details that are neither necessarily relevant, nor properly explained; (iii) the few formulas that the lecturer presents are treated as if they have fallen from the sky en bloc, without explaining bit by bit how they are obtained; (iv) the main points of each lecture are not stressed sufficiently enough, leaving one to wonder what the take-home messages are at the end of each lecture.I give the course one star due to the appreciated emphasis that the lecturer places on unorthodox economic approaches, such as behavioural economics, and on the important issue of finance democratisation.",1
many outdated instructionsinexperienced tutors who almost never explain why things are done in a certain way,1
Really bad explanation no code explain they left you on your own i'ts supposed to teach you not to left you undestand nothing they just teach components but the real thing the progaming is undeground no one knows that kinda weird :(,1
"This course was extremely time consuming because a great deal of effort was required to translate it into something I could use. I had a great deal of trouble with following the lecture videos. The demonstrations of the tools were typed on a screen that was too small and the command line tools were executed so quickly that it's hard to see where the screen full of data came from. The lecturer had such poor pronunciation that lectures' transcripts show that the voice recognition software could not understand and transcribe a lot of her words. For example, ""command"" sounded like ""comment"" and likewise was transcribed that way. More seriously, it was hard to hear the difference between ""VCF"" and ""BCF"".",1
"Assignments were uninspired and some questions were weird. Also, this textbook is horrible, and is presented in a very inconvenient format (PDF-only, two book pages per page of PDF so you can't effectively read it on a phone).",1
Poor quality audio. Monotonous lecture style with frequent inaccuracies in delivery (says one thing but actually means another). I found my motivation and performance dropped sharply in contrast to prior lectures in this series.,1
The course material as presented appears to be at least four years old. History has proven many of Professor Shelton's conclusions to be wrong. Having Professor Shelton read his powerpoint slides is a very dull way to convey information. I expected more from Georgia Tech.,1
"This is easily the worst course in the Statistics with R specialization. Contrary to the earlier courses, which were very competently taught by Dr Cetinkaya-Rundel, teaching quality is very poor in this course. Both of the main instructors are unable to explain what's going on. There is vagueness and ambiguity, which is almost impossible for the uninitiated to resolve. All in all, a very frustrating experience. The course would urgently need re-recording. As it stands, it shows a huge disrespect for the student's time and effort.",1
"The actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but, as is common with so many Coursera courses, the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other students. The purposes of these courses is to learn from experts in the field not to grade the work of others. I wish Coursera would really stop professors from pushing their responsibility- grading the work of the students and offering THEIR feedback- onto the students who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question.",1
"This course should be called ""Intro to fundamentals of website design"". You may learn, in the process of a few days, how to create a website, but not ""how to create a website in a weekend"".",1

"A weaker version of ""Fundamentals of Graphic Design"" with way too much overlap. It should not be included in the Specialization.",1
"Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money. The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students. There is no detail at all and no logical progression. I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses. I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material. The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading. The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong. I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment. I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something. I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded. The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors. Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere.",1

"AWFUL monotonous way of talking. I have such a great interest in this topic, but listening to her makes me want to rip my eyeballs out.",1
"I'm sorry, but I have taken many courses on Coursera and this is, without a doubt, the absolute worst. This isn't minimal teaching, it's practically nonexistent. Frankly, buying a book would at least give more guidance than tossing one-minute 'lectures' out there and having students blindly fend for themselves under the guise of ""experimental learning"".Plus, you then have an all or nothing grade system - there is no middle ground, just pass or fail on an assignment that had little to no instruction or examples listed to begin with.I'm truly surprised that Coursera agreed to allow this course as it is. I suggest that the instructor and team see how other instructors at universities are teaching their Coursera courses. Just because something is free, it doesn't give free reign to be lazy. If I had paid for it, I would have asked for a refund. This entire course needs a serious revamp.",1

The course is not updated.,1
"The course was very nice and useful and the explanations were very good!The biggest problem of this course was that it required to be purchased in order to unlock the quizzes and the assignments. I don't know who decided to do this (the organizers of this course or Coursera) but I don't think it was a good idea.I was not interested (and I am sure I am not the only one) in receiving a certificate. I just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledge.I realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money, but you can obtain the needed money from other sources (donations, sponsorships) without affecting those who want to learn. Event that the access to the video was not restricted (thus, many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want), the assignments have their important role in the learning process.I saw that I am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course. I hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this course.To sum up, the information from this course and the manner of providing this, deserves 5 stars. Because of the purchasing issue, I am giving only one star.",1
Very superficial and inconclusive.The course professor focuses more on himself than on the material.,1
"poorly planned, irrelevant to the subject test questions.",1
"Omigod! You're kicking this off in R-studio and teaching the whole course from this interface? Could you at least use a pen with ink that we can read when you're not in R?!This might be the last straw for me in this specialization. Nothing about this subject matter is easily digestible for a designer, and I'm okay with that. (I'm also a web/js developer, so I'm used to intense struggles with really abstract stuff.)What I can't get over is that this is part of an interaction design specialization that teaches design concepts, but whose instructors almost never practice those concepts in their pedagogy. ""Do as I say, not as I do"" seems to be the prevailing MO. The whole effort seems totally half-baked, and nowhere more so than in this course.I might not be so harsh if there weren't such great examples of well designed pedagogy elsewhere in Coursera, and for material that's at least as dry as statistics.",1
Too much emphasis on taking tests versus actually programming.,1
Got as far as lesson six. Took test and received 78%. Have been trying without success to retake the test. There does not seem to be anywhere to try and find out how to fix this.???????????????????????,1
Very poorly structured. Explanation and examples were not very helpful. should revamp the course content and video lectures (specially the steganography part).,1
Really not good. I am trying to find out how to un enroll,1
"Total disappointment. This was only clipping through a tool, not a real capstone project.",1
Very boring presentation of the material,1
"You can't do the assignments unless you pay the subscription. The founding idea of MOOCs was to make education more accesible. How do you test your knowledge if you can't submit assignments? I understand paying for a certificate, but I don't want the certificate.",1
Very bad explanation too boring lectures,1
I found some slides to be inaccurate which makes the material difficult to learn. Also I found the instructor's presentation style to be too abstract. I think a more practical style would be more suitable.,1
"thanks for your effort to make videos, but this is the first time find a class that i can not submit my answer to check if it is correct or not before my account is upgraded. Disappoint to Coursera and Duke.",1
After almost a year I am still waiting to receive my grade of 90%+ for c,1
"gets way too in-depth with the math behind regression, to the point that it deters from the learning process. was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting regression, not the inner workings of the algorithms.assignments got overly complex with confusing instructions. there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students' python capabilities are. vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learning.will continue in the specialization, but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like this.very disappointed.",1
"It needs project based exams, not quizzes. These project exams should be a combination of automated programming tasks, like the kind you find on HackerRank or Codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the readability of each others code. As it currently stands, this course is a joke.",1
"Might be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series. Very disappointing. Refunded after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4. I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.Too many trivially short and low information density videos. Handwavy mathematics. I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purports real-world value. Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: ""So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I can't think of right now. But of course there's lots of interesting examples. So go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."" Really? How about: ""Cut! Take two.""Many poor design choices for the presentation. Too much time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slides.As of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses.",1
It's useless and lacking enthusiasm.,1
"this course is definitely NOT for beginners. you MUST have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math. I had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course. This course also does not teach you everything about excel, let alone master it. you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes. thats it. Good luck figuring those out.",1
"I am dropping the course.Suggestions1) One person talk to the audience...rather than 2 or 3 talking to each other2) Volume and pic quality poor3) Its going too slowly.....just not enough ""meat"" to get me engaged...esp if u compare to the course by Paul Hegarty Stanford",1
"Honestly, for the price paid, the value given is quite low. I expected to have more hands-on working with the Hadoop ecosystem rather than this course's focus on background that really does not help one to become productive.",1
Learned more about image processing than Swift.,1
"The entire course lacks a ""flow"". It looks like concepts that are taught are picked at random and stuffed into the course. The quizzes really do not complement the material taught. The instructor wants the students to focus on specific wordings of his lecture rather than the concepts, in order to pass the quizzes.",1
"[I am speaking from my personal experience about this course. I don't mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and I am not doubting the credentials of instructors. It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying. However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course. This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all. The teaching method did not quite please me. It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen. Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016).I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges. They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots. They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures. They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter.This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for. Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying).I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear. It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video. I would rather read a book on this subject.I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.",1
"Very bad course. The content can barely be applied outside US, you don't know from which perspective it's explained (for sales or purchasing people), the videos are bad quality, the teacher is babbling, no extra resources, no interaction with the audience outside the assessments.",1
Too much version specific details.Instructor was reading slides vs explaining the technologies ( telling a story )The Quiz part cant be more lame,1
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.,1
"the peer grading system is poor, considering that they are learning just like us.the grading should be done automatically or by a professional .",1
This is far too rudimentary to be something produced by a university,1
"3 introduction videos each week, and tons of links for reading?Do not want.The worst course I ever took.Not enough Video material with good explanations. All we got - links to articles which we can found ourselves without any help.",1
Dearth of any specific / practical tools.,1
"It is not a recommended course, when they explain something they assume that we are expert and we know all what they are talking about, they need to have statistics experts which is not mentioned in course prerequisite.================I recommend to review the material and to review the purpose of this course",1
"Few explanations, no feedback after doing things wrong.",1
"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1
"This is my first course in coursera.Cons:Information redundancy, unnecessary required reading.Extend some information that only need few hours to study to a 6 weeks courses.Pros:There are some useful basic concepts & frames",1
Disappointed by the course content ( except for the 4th week).The course content is US specific which has no relevance for international students. How am I bothered about Obama care or other american statutes?!!,1
"I don't mean to be harsh, but this course is increibly boring and sluggish. The reading material is heavy, the lecturers speak so slowly and dispassionately that it's impossible to engage with the subject.I'm sure that there is really good content here, but I couldn't find it.",1
Instructor is clearly reading off of cards or a prompter that doesn't face the camera so he's constantly not looking at you which is frustrating. The feeling of each lesson being so scripted takes away from the feeling of a professor teaching material with which he is comfortable. Comparing this to UC San Diego course videos is like night and day and really makes you realize the importance of quality production/natural flow of teaching.,1
not a good course,1
"Executive Summary: Do not spend time on this course if you have minimal common sense and have read at least one article on Data Science.I finished the 11 week course ""Machine Learning - Stanford University - by Andrew Ng"" 2 months ago, which was such a great course! It kept me busy for about 20 days (at about 4-6 hours per day) and I learned so much!This course ""A Crash Course in Data Science - Johns Hopkins University"" , Part of a 5-course series, the Executive Data Science Specialization, provided just some superficial obvious information, took me only 3 hours to complete and even this time I would could wasted time.Finally coursera now starts to make courses smaller and smaller and them adding multiple of them up to ""Specialization"", so that at the end you have to pay much more to get a certain amount of information and course time. With this course they seem to have streched it to a new extreme. The price for the certificate for this superficial short mini course has reached the same price ($ 44) as what I payed for the extensive great Machine Learning course from Stanford University by Andrew Ng !",1
The material is extremely fragmented and it seems like that the instructor is just throwing information at you without caring if you are absorbing any of it at all. I got a headache and lost my motivation to learn the subject!,1
Too much introduction,1
Very bad Because you need 3 persons to evaluate you every week and often this persons is not educated or gives a score zero for all . So having to re-course or leaving without convincing reason,1
"poor course, saturated, with an instructer that uses big words and does not explain many difficult ideas, and take for granted that the leaner knows a lot of probability and statistics.",1
The material used for this course is so old that makes me feel I'm taking a course in the 90's. The narration is very dull and therefore hard to follow. Really disappointing.,1
Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer raqting stuff which I despise. And there seems to be no way to un-enroll.,1
"Nothing but badly put together videos and recommendations for readings. The only terrible course on Coursera I've come across, and I've done a few dozen of them.",1
The worst Coursera course I have taken. Total waste of time. The lectures are boring and have no real content. The supplementary materials are good though.,1
Boring,1
"I drop at the beginning of the Javascript, before Javascript, everything is good, after Javascript, ""What are they talking about""?",1
"A lot of powerpoint, nothing else.",1
"huge waste of time, they will give you very little information and what is expected for you to be able to do with that information is astronomical, you will never learn any of the details of how computing works, how functions work, the mechanism behind these computations, or anything. To give you an example, you will first watch a horribly made video on boolean logic, alter going to youtube to get a better explanation of 'And', 'or' , and 'not', you'll see an example done with If, else, and elif, then be asked to do homework problems using and, or, not. This huge gap between the information given, and the information you are expected to know to solve the problems they give you is too large, I found differential equations easier than this",1
"Very confusing course, unclear example, too theoretical (very limited relevancy to business questions)Also, presentation format could be improved (tables are not intuitive to read/understand)",1
I thought it was free. I might was well go to Google to learn Android development.,1
Too much material to get done in time frame given for full-time working parent.,1
"Videos and materials are fine, but insufficient for the quizzes, which are apparently very difficult even for PhDs in the field.",1
Thoroughly disappointed to see this course based on,1
Crippleware if you don't,1
This course doesn't worth the price. It just split a semester long course into eight chapters.,1
very low length to content ratio; basic content,1
We spent several months waiting for this capstone to appear. The instructors dissapeared and nobody knew if this one was going finally to happen or what.,1
"It is not well done as the previous courses. The quizzes usually do not concern the topic of the lessons or better, the lessons do not help in anyway to solve the problems.",1
This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.,1
This was the worst course I have taken with ASU on Coursera. Feedback was minimal and the system had many technical issues. Videos didn't start properly and there was no help or feedback from the instructors or the peers. I have wasted a lot of time resubmitting my assignments due to technical issues. Waste of my time.,1
Last week was incredibly difficult.,1
"This capstone project was a huge disappointment to me. The course caption stated that this would be where we would use Location, Design and Usability, and Persistence and Settings to build a high quality app. Also stated is that ""you’ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch."" Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teacher's specification. That text now seems to have been removed.Anyway, none of these promises were kept. Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features. Unfortunately this framework isn't very competent, so there's only so much you can do with it. Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review. How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three. There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app. For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students.",1
"The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement, progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation, says absolutely nothing about climate science. At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting. Will share these observations widely. We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can. When I was taking this course, my city is going through severe flooding and the country is in yellow alert stage due to abnormal thunder storms. You should be ashamed of yourself for pushing this garbage.",1
"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something.",1
"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.",1
"Very scattered and long lessons. Very difficult to learn something that is not ""textual"". Examination is based on literal terms (e.g: what year was XX reform enacted""). Not the type of knowledge I thought I would get",1
"Not a fan of this course. Reasons:1) The subject material is presented in a dry manner (too much talking and jargon) - I find it repetitive and boring. I have to play it at least 1.75x in order to get through the material and try and stay engaged but I still have a hard time paying attention. Seriously, so boring!2) There is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays (peer reviews)This course can benefit from:1) Clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations, as well as cutting out the repetitiveness (and the assault of the jargonaut)2) A better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words (jargon)",1
"The information was interesting but sort of long. In fact, I started this so long ago that I don't remember most of what was said, only that it was long. I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better. I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers. I have a huge problem with the peer review process. It is of no value and should be banned. Be that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is NO ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE COURSE!! There is not one posting from course staff in the forums. There has been no response to any of the so called, ""comment on this assignment"" messages I've been leaving since JULY. There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago. It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course. If no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down. If you just want the information, watch the videos but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course. I've wasted too much time on this. I'm done.",1
waste of time and money,1
too many grading errors.,1
Academical with close to no real life value.,1
The course doesn't prepare you for the final project.,1
"The material is very poorly explained. Pre-coded stuff isn't good either, as it's very hard to comprehend, even with the professor's explanations, which also don't seem to be aimed at beginners.",1
"First, the assignments always had poor instructions. It wasn't until grading time you would find out what the criteria are. (After your assignment is submitted)Secondly, there was no documentation/help for the fact the Windows needs a webserver to run content in this section. (Many versions of Windows can't do this) Discovered/resolved over many hours, when course content would not work.The actual course content was sparse/not much to it other than ""Bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap."" After how good the first course was/how much ground it covered, this course was frustrating, poorly documented, and a disappointment.",1
I wish I had paid closer attention to the refund policy. The production quality and content did not meet my expectations.,1
"Unfortunately, this specific course lacks in-depth information and problems and exercises in order to get an individual to explore the wide subject, that is, statistics.",1
"First of all I expected something deeper. First of all this courser is less understandable than ""The Swift Programming Language"" free book from Apple. Before I join the course I have read a few chapters and from my point of view book explains material much much better. The second point – it looks like tutors invent examples during the lesson (on the fly), this is bring a mess. And last thing about this course that tutors commit an gross error during lecture. Please have a look at ""Advanced Swift"" lecture, I am talking about closures. The teacher said that closure captures the copy of outside variable, but this is completely wrong! Closures capture the variable itself, not the variable value",1
"Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear. Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning.",1
I agree!,1
The course was very shallow as if teaching english literature,1
No ancillary reading material or text to help along with the assignments lead me to fail the course.,1
Very poor course... You can pass it in a one day even if you never program Python.,1
"Avoid this course like the plague. Terribly taught, no support, problems only vaguely related to the course material, and designed to force you to buy the manual for the course. The next classes in the specialization get even worse, with the student forums full of students who can't get any help though the grueling process of installing Oracle, Pentaho, etc. on a personal laptop. I was fortunate to have experience with the tools, would have never managed to finish the course just based on the terribly taught material.",1
"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short. It was too basic and slow paced. The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals. And it's certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class. Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that while providing more content, and making the content relevant.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.I'm not sure about the value of the videos titled ""Office Hours."" They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this video in Paris."" They're really nothing more than that. In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to talk with me too."" After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"" ""What was the point?"" And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""another waste of time.""",1
"This course is not about Excel or MYSQL. This is only about Probability distribution, binary classification etc. So, if you're interested in learning some Math, this is a great course for you. But certainly not for learning some basic Excel and MYSQL. I am very disappointed and have lost all my money for nothing. I did not learn what I had initially thought I will. I feel cheated, I have lost both time and money at the same time.",1
"I was led to believe that I would be learning the fundamentals of graphic design, which to me means learning how to use Photoshop, InDesign, etc. This is more about learning how to create art in general, not exactly what I'm looking for.",1
bad instructor,1
"Databases very difficult to work with, and badly programmed.",1
It was too bad to not permit the students to perform the quizzes! Only if we pay for them! I thought the payment was for the certificate!,1
"From my perspective, the individual courses that made up the ""Capstone"" (people, customer, accounting, and operations analytics) were both educative and interactive. These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.However, the final ""Capstone"" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about. After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan. The entire ""Capstone"" was driven by hypotheticals, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses. An educated individual could easily complete this ""Capstone"", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses. The ""Capstone"" provided a few articles and videos related to the issue (Yahoo Ad Blocker) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content. I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the Ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business. However, the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions. This ""Capstone"" hardly related to the previous four courses, and it is a scam that this course cost $99.",1
Very confusing subject which could have been better presented.,1
"The jump from the lecture material to the assignments was way too much. In order to complete the assignments, one needs to spend lots of time learning things not covered in the course.",1
"Disappointing. Just brushed the surface of most of the topics, felt a bit too much like an ad for PWC or story telling about client engagements. Content was lacking",1
"I think this course if poorly organized. The instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy, but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless. I, for one, need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanations.I paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises, which I also think it's a minus.All in all it didn't ""ENHANCE"" my career prospects, mostly because nothing useful was taught here. Wouldn't recommend anyone to pay for it.",1
too mechanistic. not much creative modules.,1
Very basic and superficial course. Apologies each time derivatives need to be used.,1
My expectations were different,1
It was not w,1
"I expected much more. The course material is really weak, did not improve my knowledge about Cyber Security. I am very disappointed, also cos I payed 30 dollars to a certificate. I do not recommend this course",1
"Not aligned to PMI. Should be ideally directed towards helping prepare for recognized certifications like PMP, Prince2 etc.",1
The slides are very difficult to follow. It could be better designed,1
"This course didn't talk too much about data management and visualization, which made me feel quite disappointed. And you couldn't feel you could practiced what you learned in the course in the assignment. Most part of the assignment just focused on making some comments.",1
"im in week 4 , cant master data analysis in Excel",1
"There was little of actual teaching going on in this course, the pace was too rushed for beginners and peer-reviewing was managed so poorly it was unhelpful.",1
"I understand it is a technical subject but going slide after slide reading the material without any clear explanation, is not learning is just reciting.It would have been better to try and put only half of the facts (we can always search for specific flag) and explain more about use cases.There has to be a better way to pass the materials.",1
It's a course which is designed to preview the other courses. It could easily be eliminated,1
Quizzes and assignments cannot be submitted if course is audited.,1
"This course is a total disappointment in comparison with all the other courses from this specialization.The quality of the course is very poor:- reading links are outdated and not available;- assignments are superficial;- tests consist of questions which do not make you think but make you memorize unnecessary numbers;- lectures are presented poorly. They are read from the screen and you feel that attitude. Very often they include videos from reading.The course feels like an outdated or a class for mentally defective: read about it, then we'll repeat the same in the lectures, then you'll pass the test with the same kind of questions, then we'll ask you to make an assignment, answering the question that has already been discussed three times once again. Do not bother to think, just repeat, because that's what necessary.I struggled to finish this course only because of the whole specialization and a great job which has been done by all the other professors.",1
"This has to be the poorest educational experience Ive ever had. Virtually nothing is explained. The instructor says time & time again that she's not going to bother to explain in detail and that we should go out & explore all these free resources if we want to learn. SO WHY DID I PAY FOR THIS CLASS? Honestly, save your money. This is nothing but a rip-off and I am shocked that an institution like U of M would allow such a sloppy, lazy product to be out there under its brand.To make matters worse, we are instructed time & time again to go out onto the discussion board and ask for help when she doesn't want to bother explaining a concept.1. Everyone else taking this class is confused too - how could they possibly be of any help to me?2. The staff who comes onto the boards are just about as rude & unhelpful as any I've ever seen. They literally say ""well, did you WATCH the lecture?"" Ummm- yes I did & it directed me to come here for help.I feel duped. This is a scam and I can only say I am sorry I paid my money for this. If you really want to learn CSS, get yourself a good book on the subject and/or utilize the free material out on the internet. This will absolutely waste hours of your time and way too much of your money for what they are providing.",1
It is tottaly unacceptable to have to pay to pass quizz !!!I cancel my participation,1
":The course capstone was very disappointing. it has nothing to do with business and financial modeling, it is nothing more than a very questionable portfolio construction exercise on optimized weights and parameters. Not only such a portfolio is pretty unrealistic, but it has nothing to do with business modeling!",1
"Instructor seems uninterested or bored. Sometimes he only reads the slides without adding anything else to the content. Others, he goes quickly through a slide without any time to digest the information. Overall, intro level concepts are ok, but specifics about creation or handling of tools is left without deeper explanation",1
"Don't know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation. Besides, it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel",1
"Outdated, unintelligibly exercises, terrible lectures.",1
"The false comparison between religion and soul beliefs cloud the validity of the course. Maybe the intent was to only show the worst case ""Soul Beliefs"" then shoot them down. However, at least to me, the instructor seemed to extrapolate ""some beliefs"" to ""all beliefs"".",1
Too basic and too focused on 'farmers market' thinking.,1
"Overall I was disappointed with this course. In the end I don't think it was any better than any of the free online tutorials out there. The instructor spoke so quickly in the videos he was nearly incomprehensible. The explanations were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than ""type this... now type this."". I'm well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself, but if I pay for a course I expect an explanation of how things work under the hood. I was looking forward to taking the entire Ruby On Rails specialization, now I'm not so sure.",1
"I would not recommend this specialization to anyone. The first assignment is just a first review of the final project, but it is almost impossible to pass, because the questions are not organized in a manner of constructive feedback.",1
Without any discussion forum and at least a mentor this course has nothing new to offer than a You Tube video. There are some inconsistency in the materials as well. Alluring student by the name of UCI and giving the students the worst is hypocrisy.,1
"Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site! I found that the lecturers sometimes used random terminology without ever explaining it (for example, ""tags"" is another word for sequencing reads, but this is only ever used in RNA-seq methodology, and then only rarely). Also, the final peer reviewed project isn't explained very well and uses tools and methods that aren't even within the scope of the module. Mostly just a waste of time.",1
"I was expecting to solve problems using more open-sourced package. Unfortunately, I feel this series of courses are more of an advertisement for the instructor's software company.",1
Way to technical,1
"I think this course has a lot of value, but when I started these course I was unaware I would need a few hundred more dollars and did not budget for such things.",1
Typically aimed at the US lifestyle,1
"This was an extremely elementary and thus disappointing course. While the importance of ""Usability"" was rightly emphasized, the representation in terms of examples, case studies, etc. was simplistic. I appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of HCI design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems. However, the solutions were presented as if: 1.) there are always ""correct"" interface/usability choices; 2.) the ""correct"" choice is all that's needed for the system to be optimally functional; and 3.) there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system (that can't be resolved with correcting the usability).It is irresponsible to suggest, for example, that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guide/nudge the user to create a secure password. Wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course. There is nothing wrong with studying old, seminal research, even in this age of ""Internet time,"" but I wish I wasn't left wondering what, if any, developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took place.As for tension between usability and security, it absolutely exists. For instance, PGP encryption is a reliable way to secure information, yet making it usable remains a challenge. This is not even mentioned in the entire course. In fact, this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look. I wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate security.Lastly, for those designing an HCI for security, it is important to understand threat models. This concept is also missing from the course.===I reviewed this course (above) immediately after I finished it. I am now in the 3rd week of Software Security, the 2nd course in the Cybersecurity specialization, and am realizing that 2 stars was a generous assessment. Based on the prerequisites of the Software Security course, the Usable Security course, in its current form, is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experience/knowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization. As I explained above, the course relies heavily on decade-old research but does not cover any developments since. For instance, the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published. Another example is the instructor's eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use. The usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate.",1
I suggest to include more and clearer examples to solve problems.,1
"Does very little to actually help you learn JAVA. Explains nothing about why the language works as it does.. Also it insists on you using their libraries and programming environments. You spend perhaps 20% of your time actually practicing coding, and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again. Such a waste",1
"They push the University of Maryland way too much, the book and the videos have much of the same content. The book that you buy is written by the professor who runs the course which I do not agree with. The book could be more direct in how it gives you the lessons.",1
"While I learned quite a bit from the course, I found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be. Mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course, course content was broken and/or missing, and the level of background in both calculus/probability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning. In general, the holistic experience of this course was disappointing and frankly, I would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment.",1
Severe lack of support (zero) from the professor or TAs. Some wrong solutions were provided for assigments but were never addressed or acknowledged that it will be fixed. Some assignment files are not Mac friendly or is just not viewable by all students (I can't tell). Materials are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretations and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practices. To think that I paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment AND I have to do the grading BUT I do not receive support? This is ridiculous. I will have to think three times before I pay for a Coursera course in the future. Never again. I will not recommend this to others.,1
I feel like the lectures were short summaries - not actual college level lectures. I really don't feel I learned anything.,1
"Pretty bad as far as I am conerned. I spent two days clicking back and forth and listening to a lot of talk that taught me nothing. Sorry about that, but there are better courses on the Internet than this one.",1
"Honestly i only finished week 1. I was sorely disappointed that the quizzes were locked. I wasn't aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quizzes as other courses offer this option. From what I gather from week 1 the course topics seems really good. I think it would be great if you consider letting persons who audit take the quizzes otherwise what's the use - I mean i could always go on youtube and watch videos on the same topics, the difference with coursera courses is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quizzes and assignment. I hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz. My issue above is the reason why I gave the course a 1 out of 5.",1
This course has been dumbed down so much that no moderately intelligent person should be subjected to it. Coursera really needs to rethink its approach to teaching. I can only express my sympathy for those were seduced into actually paying for this course.,1
"The course content is very poorly explained. The quiz questions don't really test what was taught in the lectures, and the assignments are just copying and pasting things. I feel like I still have a very poor understanding of what was supposedly covered in the course. I cannot generalise or apply the 'learned' information or skills to other topics or researches because I didn't actually understand the core concepts or how to use the programs.",1
"the quality of this course is very low, and the content are not interesting and useful at all.",1
The course is ok but the certification procedure is a mess!No statement of accomplishment and you have to retake all the assignments if you want the certificate and had not been verified ....,1
"Not a fan of this course. Reasons:1) The subject material is presented in a dry manner (too much talking and jargon) - I find it repetitive and boring. I have to play it at least 1.75x in order to get through the material and try and stay engaged but I still have a hard time paying attention. Seriously, so boring!2) There is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays (peer reviews)This course can benefit from:1) Clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations, as well as cutting out the repetitiveness (and the assault of the jargonaut)2) A better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words (jargon)",1
"Sadly, this course is at the high school level at the most. Very disappointing to see it listet here as a university course.",1
Unsufficient information for the programming assignments.,1
Not So help full about Smartphone. Now aday everyone knows What is there in Smartphone.,1
"In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research. The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one).I do not recommend this course or the specialization.",1
Lecture presentation is very very robotic. It's hard to follow the lecture without proper diagrams or examples.,1
"Very general, and knowledge you could easily acquire from the web. The only difference is the presentation of the information is stretched over an hour worth of video. The most useful part of this course however is the walk-through examples provided.",1
Too much covered.,1
The videos doesn't tell anything related to the test. How can I know the answers? Am I going to search them on the internet? Then what the meaning to learn this course?,1
Week 4 does not give enough explanation or extra resources and makes it unable to complete the exercises.,1
"Definitely they can do a much better job, despite there're many improvements compared to the first course. However, the introduction is lack of logic, and I still find myself lacking of systematic command of the material towards the end of this session. Kind of disappointed.",1
"Actually, I am quite disappointed by this course. The language is so slow that it is terribly difficult to make sense of each sentence.The content barely scratches the surface and there is neither a forum, nor an exchange with other learners. I miss interactivity and I am glad that I decided to preview the course and not pay for it as it definitely is not worth the money.",1
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,1
"Poor quality and heavily outdated content. Video quizzes were broken more often than not. Module Quizzes questions and answers were vague and poorly constructed resulting in choosing incorrect answers.Reading material was of poor quality with many ""industry professionals"" not being professional enough to perform a simple spelling and grammar check.",1
A poor end to a poor Coursera specializations.,1
"I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python. The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",1
"The lectures are a very brief overview of topics, with nothing actually taught. The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages. This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn, Coursera, and everyone involved. It's clear that the instructors don't care about student's actually learning anything. Compare this to the ""Underactuated Robotics"" course on EdX.",1
"Content very light, near of empty course.",1
Poorly designed course which tests people on things that are not taught.,1
Bad content and instructor. no logistic in place. if you are planning to pay to get certificate. I would suggest look else where. my $279 are stuck in here and they don't reply to forum posts.,1
I'm not a conversational learner. I like to learn via the puzzle method.,1
This course states that it is for people with no knowledge in SAS. I had to go online elsewhere to learn SAS before completing this course. There are free SAS tutorials on the SAS webpage - I highly recommend completing them before trying this course.,1
"Simple & Clear , Handsome teacher!",1
"As a person who actually studied physics and knows a little about data science, I am literally baffled the way information presented and lectures speak. Really don't recommend this cource at all. because Week 1 materals is a imcomprehenisble mess full of incorrect explanation and vague definitions.",1
"1) Not worth the money and time. The reason I say this is because the same concepts are reviewed and explained in lot more fun, creative, and interactive manner at other free of cost resources like Khan academy, youTube channels, etc2) Who is the audience? I don't think instructor has any idea of target audience. Are these meant for novice or advanced learners ?3) Why so serious? My philosophy is that if I want to appear in video, i better learn to cheer up. Seriously i mean after dealing with rush hour traffic and psychopath boss, I don't want to see a unhappy serious looking face throughout a course. Not good for my heart!Sorry if it is a mean (not statistic mean!) or anything but I have come here investing my money and time (out of my family time) . And I am not happy with this course.The only reason I have to complete this course is because of the requirement in specialization degree. I won't mind getting my refund back on this course.",1
"After 97% of the work completed, I have to admit that this course is NOT GOOD. The instructor is not actually the professor himself, and they do lots of mistakes in the videos. You do not learn anything that helpful, and perhaps the actual Swift documentation is way more clearer than this course is.",1
"The whole course based on some proprietary software. In general, it seems that the main goal of the course is promote that software.",1
"The only option I had was to watch videos, I could not submit quizzes, which I completed, unless I paid.What's even the point of having this course as part of Coursera?Very disappointed. Shame on the University of Maryland, College Park. Will stay away from this school.",1
"The course is as much about computer programming as it is about statistics. The statistics I can do with pen and paper; the programming, I found very, very unhelpful and confusing. Eventually, I gave up on the course.",1
"This course was very disappointing and much of the content in the tests and course did not show up in the course project. I felt like the course project was far more advanced than all the other detail. In addition, there was minimal to NO detail on instruction. VERY poor development here and I would not recommend it to anyone. All you need to do is look at all the threads of complaints. I am looking forward to the next Python course and h",1
"Very poor .........Never expected this from COURSERA. The person is just reading the slides, there is no learning action taking place",1

"Very low level , im sorry but this cant be even considered a good intro to HTML,CSS im going to stop wasting my time watching this.no chllange in the assignments or questions , + more of an overview of the basics then the basics ..",1
The Assignment questions are unclear due to which a lot of time has to be invested.,1
"after watching so many videos like ""how i got started on seo"" ""how to find a job as seo"" ""how to answer in an interview for SEO jobs"" I've realized this course really needs to focus on what people wants to hear. We want to learn SEO not how someone got started on seo!",1
"Not really useful as course, but only as introduction to other materials... feels more like an ad than a real course",1
I really did want to take this course in a specialization mode. However I sampled some of the course videos in the different courses making this specialization and decided against it.In the course videos we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and power-point slides with a flat voice in the background reading the slides. In my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this MOOC considering one has to pay for the specialization. There were also no discussion forums of any kind available. More work should be put into the making of the lecture videos by the school to give it a realistic classroom experience.Unfortunately I dropped out of the MOOC because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me.,1
no basics being taught! straight away code snippets are pasted.,1
"I attempted to take this course because I really wanted to learn more about the US Constitution and how it applies to my daily life. I made it to week three before I could no longer keep listening to Professor Amar drone on and turn a 10 minute lecture into a 25 minute lecture with filler words, tangents and lack of structure. Professor Amar is very knowledgeable about the Constitution and I don't doubt his credentials or accomplishments. However, with out an outline, slides, notes, structure... something... anything... this class is just a talking head that is painfully hard to pay attention to. If you're an auditory learner and prefer the old school, pretentious, Ivy League lecture hall format this is the class for you.",1
There is a gap between the instruction level and the difficulty of quizzes and final projects.,1
The jump to javascript is too great for beginners. Fundamental concepts of programming severely need more time spent on but are in fact glossed over too quickly.,1
The course is a wonderfulBut the idea of a peer and the final assignment a very badYou need to wait ... for several days and a waste of your time in order to be assessed by other peopleThese people may be incompetent and give you a zero for no reasonAnd lost your effort and your time,1
"I managed to complete this course, but that was because of my four years of ""MOOC-level"" ""programming experience"" and duckduckgo (~google), not because of the course material. Videos are dull readings of the pdfs, with many ""ummmm""s and annoying lip-clicks. Examples are useless, explanations are often vague or even incomplete. The assignments are relatively hard in that you don't get all the necessary info from the course, sometimes even R's own manpages aren't enough. (Which is a shame, as you'd expect a course to teach you how to use the tools you will need for the assignments.)If you have no programming experience, stay away from this course!Otherwise, if you want to learn R, look for other resources, and save yourself some time and money.",1
"Major issues with the tests not accepting Chinese or pinyin text which they failed to respond to, despite multiple complaints.",1
There is too much talk about climate change.,1
The peer reviewed assignments in this course are discriminatory towards people with learning disabilities. Coursera is unwilling to provide any accommodation to relieve this discrimination.,1
"Only for those who are new to everything involving computers. If you know how to turn your own computer off and on, look for a more advanced course than this.",1
"It is not what I was expecting to learn from this course. The course syllabus seems very good but the actual lectures are not good. I would not recommend this course to any one. I don't think we can call this as introduction of HRM because it doesn't give us any knowledge related with HRM. The only new term to me is the high-road vs. low-road, the rest is the common sense to me.",1
A waste of time. One long advertisement for the instructor's book.,1
absolutely one of the worst courses... I am deleting it from my list.no slides make it harder to follow.,1
Not really useful ~ I would like to email in a PDF file of comments,1
Very American perspective.,1
I was somewhat disappointed with the content of this course. It seems shallow and disintegrated to me. Its difficult to say that this course provides some practical knowledge.,1
This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.,1
its boring,1
"Not worth the money. The material is weak ,and the peer-grading process is very casual.",1
"The weekly lectures/assignments did little to prepare for the final assignment. They were short and high level without any coding to back them up.It is possible to blaze through the first four weeks in a couple hours.....and then spend weeks on the final assignment because you will need to learn most of it on your own by looking through api documentation.To the instructors: If you want to see what a good ""intro to language"" course looks like, checkout:https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1",1
Course is very high level and teacher inspiring. As I highlighted already it took me 8 hours with a professional to install Pentaho... for what? to explain pivot tables totals. that is very unecessary. Also from Europe virtual machine use is just killing my computer and I end up spending more time crashing and restarting my pc than working on the course. (and I am surrounded by IT professionals in my company for reference). This is sadly a big let down for an excellent course theory wise.,1
Do not take this course unless you have previous C# coding experience. It is most definitely not for beginners.,1
Needs to pay for submit assignments,1
Can't finish even week 1 if you don't pay,1
"Was very frustrated with this course. Does not have a strong emphasis on Excel skills and the statistics models provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained. Quizzes were interesting, but time-consuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lectures.",1
"13 weeks long? This is basically his class syllabus transferred to a MOOC! The first video was a ridiculous waste of my time. The videography was totally unprofessional. Shaky camera, this long walk and football kicking with a brain on the football field??? The audio is horrible... use a mic. I signed up for a neuro course, not an advertisement of the campus. This guy needed an Instructional Designer to help him condense and build this course into something digestible. This is MOOC, not a college course. I am horribly disappointed at the quality. I needed an overview of the main components of Neuro Medical Science.",1
"This course was a extremely introductory course in excel. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially at the cost of $95. Aside from getting yourself thinking about using Excel and some minor lessons learned, I found it to be a complete waste of time.",1

Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money!,1
This is a totally theoretical course. This actually does not help to build a quadcopter from the scratch. It should have been mentioned in the introduction. I am opting out. The lectures did not seem appropriate for the people without proper background. Not satisfied.,1
Course is not good at all. The instructor assumes that you have a good genomic background.,1
"this was thefirst course i payed for and unfortunately the worst expierience.lack of content beyond the stuff in the available simple swift tutorials andfrom an eduucational pint of view afwully if at all preparedits as shame that i cannot give this ""course"" ZERO stars which it deserves!i should have checked the very negative feedback of the former participants before bying iti will be much MUCH more alert regarding content on coursera from now on",1

Absolutely useless course,1
very basic course. I would only recommend this if you are just starting your PhD program and you have no idea how the writing process works,1
"Of all the courses I have ever taken in my BA, MA, PhD, and MBA coursework, this was the worse. This is a tragically BAD course. No learning outcomes discussed, and the ""teaching"" is sort of mumbling while underlining and reading slides that are WAY TOO complicated and crowded. Just awful. Mistakes in quizzes and exams, frequent misspellings, low effort. One ""instructor"" Ms Mayer simply reads the slides, line by line. THAT is not teaching. Please learn how to teach and interact with your students. U of Minn should be ashamed of this course, and provide some training on how to run a distance learning course to its instructors. As it is, the course is disappointing on every level. To top it off, the instructor has the nerve to show off his boat and tell us how rich he is.... Blech. Poor taste.",1
Professor is really bad. Had to google most of the topics to understand them better. Not at all up to the usual Coursera standards. My sympathies to the people who have paid for this course.,1
Unclear assignments unfit for an international participant base.,1
I though the class focused too much on enumerating various names of technologies rather than describing them in depth.,1
"I am disappointed, from a place like Stanford I was expecting a real course in nutrition.This course doesn't teach anything. It's a mere half an hour a week of advice we should all already know, if we are interested in nutrition.I am quitting this course, unfortunately it's a waste of time.",1
"Very little content on offer other than some short clips and mildly interesting readings.

too easy,1

Very slow paced and boring. The instructor is not good at teaching.,1

shame you have to pay for this course although the content is good,1

This course disappointed me. I expected to receive knowledge about negotiation. But it's more advertisement for the book. I did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasn't in the course. I assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz. That's not why i registered on coursera.,1
"You have to pay to upload the assigments , this does not pas in other courses ...",1

one of the worst course ever,1
"I've already written a review for part 1 and I have the same opinion about this one. The course is rather poor and not challenging. Only general information about relevant topics that as well read on wikipedia. No exercises, no code assignments. A lot of this content was repeated from first two parts of this specialization.",1
Bad teacher. extremely disappointing !,1
Having to pay before you take the course is really disappointing. Not many students to interact with because of this. Course was very basic also. Not worth the money. Coursera offers many quality courses which are much better than this one.,1
"Sloppy, unorganized, and poorly presented. Try the similar class on EdX and YouTube for a much better and clear explanation and presentation.",1
"For me, this course was disappointing. Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low. It might be freshman level, but certainly not more. There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all.",1
"I do not intend this to be mean, but I could not listen to Richard Waterman. I am British and I understand that Richard was born in the UK but spent a great many years in the US. If he had a BritiI really struggled to listen to him as his accent crosses the Atlantic several times a sentence. I found I couldn't listen to WHAT he was saying because I was so distracted by HOW he was saying it. I am sorry, there is probably nothing that he can do about it and the course looked very interesting but I simply could not bring myself to continue.",1
Very disappointed at the lack of notes and course material. I hope part 5/5 improves.,1
Boring,1
Not a very informative course. A few hours' worth of reading up specs that I can also find on Wikipedia.,1
I did not find that this course added anything to what I already learned. Seems mainly a re-hash of prior material slimly disguising marketing pitch of other Northwestern courses.,1
need a sub. can't not understand what he is saying,1
Too much peer and dealing with others--not making me happy at all,1
i cannot spend $4000 per year package just to learn this course. sorry i am off...,1
I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week. Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard. Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand. Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment. Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn. Thank you.,1
"Too much introduction, not much actual useful stuff. Too much mathematically without well illustrated examples.",1
"boring lecturer, monotone, passionless reading of even more boring powerpoint slides and images, and absolutely no intelligent discussion going on in this course, I have learned more from reading the book ""the epigenetics revolution "" by nessa carey, a book written for laypersons, than I have from this course taught by university professors. don't waste your time",1
"Very through introduction course, very helpful for those who are preparing for PMP exam .",1
"The lectures and Swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow, but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult. The assignments ask for techniques that aren't focused on or even covered in the lectures. The tips offered by Al Warren in the Discussion forum make the assignments possible to do. Since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments, I think Al Warren's tips should be incorporated as part of the core course. This course needs more time to be covered in depth - it's a lot of ground to cover in just one month,",1
"very little useful information, more like PR for PWC",1
Bad content and instructor. no logistic in place. if you are planning to pay to get certificate. I would suggest look else where. my $279 are stuck in here and they don't reply to forum posts.,1
"not exciting, instructor too stiff and looked like reading a paper",1
It was too basic for me.,1
"A shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization. It is boring and full of obvious-psicology things like ""passwords need to be secure but easy to remember"". The instructor, at least, seems to have zero knowledge about software development. Everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two.",1
"What makes this course useful are the exercises so unless you are paying, don't bother, and it's not really worth paying for as it's just a synopsis of stuff you easily find on youtube.",1
"The course material is interesting (3/5) but the assignments rely heavily on reviewing the work of other students which severely detracts from the course. If I wished to grade other people's coursework, I would have pursued a career in academia instead of becoming a research scientist.",1
Perfect guided course. The only handicap to me is the accent of the speaking English. I hardly understand what they are saying without subtitles.Thx for your all precious effort.,1
"The pedagogy in this course is truly horrible. It is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples - in the beginning of each lecture would be super - motivating each technique. This is kind of a dealbreaker. Furthermore the material is REALLY dry and theoretical, lacking pragmatic problem solving. IMO way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds. Andrew Ng of Stanford University, with his course ""Machine Learning"" is a great example of how it can and should be done.Suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice. This last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course. One more thing, the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions, often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials. There are also technical bugs and missing images in the quizes. Suffice to say this is a real dealbreaker.",1
I thought it was going to be good. Did the first week videos and Lectures. But I feel cheated because it will not let me take the quiz to move on without paying for the course. No where did I ever see anything that said ahead you had to pay -- if you didn't want a certificate or to do the whole specialization. Coursera used to be a platform I used and recommended. No more.,1
"Disappointing, thought it would be more involved, perhaps with a real presentation graded by other participants in the course. Was interesting to watch the videos, but it was a 10 minute job. The other parts were OK, but after the Capstone I would hesitate to recommend the course.",1
"Practical tips are few, and neuroscience is not the title of the course, but is widely discussed. The title implies ""Tools for learning"" but I didn't get anything useful out of this course.",1
Way too elementary.,1
After 2 great courses this one is really disappointing!,1
A waste of time.,1
The instructor does a very poor job of explaining the material.,1
Poorly designed and explained. You do not really gain much knowledge from this course.I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course. There are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices.,1
"Totally unimpressed. Video lectures are terrible. Explanations are at best incomplete, usually confusing, sometimes incoherent. Instructor never gives an overview of the architecture/data flow/structure of Active Record or Action Pack, instead describes the syntax of a handful of functions. As a result you only get the most superficial understanding of the material. The graded assignments are just a regurgitation of the lectures and so don't require you to take a deeper dive into the material. In fact, in many cases the answers to the graded assignments are listed in the assignment immediately following the question.",1
"The course poorly understands the scientific method, and its main effort is to wield unconvincing critiques of science so as to elevate the status of religion in general and Creationism in particular. The last set of lectures is also just badly executed, a confusing meandering talk that amounts to nothing. The course did have a few bright points, like the second series of lectures explaining varieties of naturalism, but overall the course was just bad. Avoid this course, you can learn much more from other sources.",1
"A very high-level introduction, but the analytical part is totally missing",1
not worth your time,1
"I have been quite disappointed by this class. There were no suggested readings in addition to the quite basic videos. But the worst were the quizzs. 90% of the answers to the multiple-choice questions were the top option!! I could have pass the tests without having listen to the videos. Were those tests or jokes? You should do this class only if you know absolutely nothing about economics, because this is the most basic class.",1
This course was so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization.,1
Material is to basic for an entire course.,1
"In terms of content the course is superficial and weak, it's also too much focused on promote Cruyff event and institute.",1
"This course requires that you already are a manager or are in a position very similar to a manager. More importantly, this course is filled with ""neuro-babble"". The fact that the hoax (by now debunked) of the ""positivity ratio"" and the ""attractors of happiness"" are still in the course and presented as fact is a big red flag. Not recommended.",1
Instructor is not clear and too fast!,1
"Irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy. Having taken first ""Business Metrics for Data Driven Companies"" I had high hopes that it would be on the same level.Well, I was wrong. It was extremely messy, jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there was a general lack of motivation from professor Egger's part.Apart from week 1 that had some necessary basic knowledge of Excel, all of the next weeks' lessons were fast paced beyond a beginner's comprehension. By week 5 I had lost the motivation to go on and was only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesI would not recommend it, unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theories used in this lesson.",1
ONly in chinese. Not English subtitles.,1
"Perhaps this class would be good for a non - native english speaker. I went through the first, maybe, five videos. From what I could tell, I learned all of the stuff in this class by the age of 10. If this class is for people who english is a second language, it should be more obviose.",1
"It is very very bad that only students assess the assignments. Lots of students can't count sentences, can't see and generally are very negligent in evaluating the work of others. No teachers involve the process. No appelation possibility, no forum for discussions!",1
the cost,1
very boring lectures. expected a lot more from something like PWC. Doesn't worth it at all. Didn't learn anything new.,1
You can't do assignments using the lecture materials. Need A LOT of time to finish this course.,1
"Didn't think that this is the best course for people who want to learn about Digital Marketing. The learning process is very slow and sometimes I felt that more could be learnt by just reading a number of books or articles on this topic.There is no dialogue with the professor (or anyone who has more experience or knowledge, the assignments are checked by people who are also taking this course. Though one would expect to learn from the assignments and mistakes he or she makes during it. Instead some people who have ideas, maybe even wrong ones, about this specific area of knowledge, judge your work (I could be also wrong about those things and have to grade somebody's work, which is a bit confusing).Besides, the assignments are not very interesting or challenging. I wouldn't recommend passing this course.",1
"I have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course - and one spread over 4 weeks. It is extremely basic, extremely general and extremely high level. It should be compressed to 1-2 hours and added as an _optional prerequisite_ to other courses in this specialization. I personally feel cheated out of my 29 USD.0.1 star.",1
Not the best course for beginners. Too much theory and no implementation. Also the assignments were impossible for a beginner.,1
Interesting to say the leastWhy cant i access my certificate. I paid and successfully passed,1
"A lazy reviewer gave me the score of 0 and left me this comment: ""I am not able to give any score, I tried very hard to understand the matter but it was difficult for me. I have to score it just for me to check the other student's work. Please don't consider my scoring here."" I studied hard and received this poor evauation. I screamed for help many times but no one replied to my request. The quality of the course is superb and my experience is completely ruined by a shitty score which does not reflect my work.",1
I think the course is really missing some key parts.,1
"doesn't have to be that complicated with command prompt actions from the beginning of the course, that make the motivation drop very fast.",1
The course is so weak. No enough illustration for the content of the course. It's too short and not prepared very well.,1
"lecture too focus on the theory that not very useful on business world. The BI tool ""microStrategy"" used in the homework is too slow and crash from time to time.",1
Nothing good in this course,1
it is very basic course just giving the introduction to a layman.,1
"Very very introductory. This course explores the Buddhist theory of suffering and liberation by comparing it to evolutionary psychological theories.It is not a deep course on Buddhism - it lacks any substantive discussion of differences between Buddhist schools, of the difficulty of reconstructing the ""historical"" Buddha (a problem as difficult as reconstructing the ""historical Christ""), of the fact that Buddhism as popularized in the West is actually quite different from any of the Asian forms of Buddhism, etc.Also, evolutionary psychology is controversial in its own right - one criticism of it is that it creates ""just-so"" stories about the origins of mental processes that are impossible to verify (or falsify). These objections are well known, but are not confronted in the course.A scholarly much sounder and deeper course is the one on Tibetan Buddhism from University of Virginia. It suffers from truly appalling presentation (the video lectures are some of the most boring I have ever watched), but the diversity of angles from which Buddhism is examined, and the depth of content are really outstanding.",1
"The course does not warrant the price, it has way too little information. Very dissatisfied.",1
"The material on graph analytics was of introductory level. A string of interesting ideas, with unclear explanations. The lesson on GraphX was basically a copy-paste introduction to it's abilities without actually teaching how to use it. The transcripts are full of mistakes. Someone not proficient in English or hard of hearing would be confused by them. It was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer. The best part was the explanation of Neo4j - and it was at an introductory level. A disappointment.",1
"I feel this course was severely misrepresented. This clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement. And the ""4-6 hours"" of expected student involvement is ridiculous. A beginner (NO programming experience) should expect to spend 15 to 20 hours on the first week alone and at least 10 hours for each of the remaining weeks.I have over 25 years of programming experience in Assembly language, Visual Basic, C and C++. I am clearly NOT at the beginner level yet I spent more than 11 hours on the first week, mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course. Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment. If anyone spent less than 6 hours on week 1, then that was NOT the first time they took this class.I also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignments/quizzes. Having to type ""-1*1+11"" instead of ""-i+11"" (and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces!!) for instance.Bottom line, I would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to Learn Java for Android Programming unless you already know Java and just want some intro on Android development with Android Studio. And if you are indeed at the beginner level, do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in Computer Science.",1
This is just because of the unclarity of the final assignment.,1
"Although I have passion with film, the quizzes seems to have lots of technical problems. I dropped out right on the first module",1
"First time I gave 1 star. Reason, lecturers are terrible. This deserves a report, if there was adequate reporting system on Coursera. I had a feeling like I was watching professors from school for disabled, and not an university. . . Course material is actually decent, but extremely badly presented. Sadly, I enrolled into second course as well, and hoping that one will be better, so I wont have to go through refund hell.",1
This is a joke right?5 minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effective?!you guys are ridiculous!,1
"Very poor course, especially when it gets to the last weeks, there are no enough instructions to help you in the exam. it is all about money transaction, I am sorry to say that.",1
"Old fashioned Econometrics course, still using the ideas of fixed regressors (rather than the more sensible conditional models approach), emphasizing prediction instead of causal interpretation, etc.",1
This is not a course - this is a 90 minutes lecture.The idea is greate. But this lecture is only start. Its very brief and not profound.This more advices and not scientifically oriented.,1
"While the content is very helpful and Gary does his best to make people confident to improvise in Jazz music, this course has imho two major flaws:The biggest one: assignments given and results accepted do not fit together. E.g. in week 1 learners are supposed to describe in their own words how a piece of music does sound like. But the accepted answers are totally different from such a description. Instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted. This leads to studends copying these answers into their assignments without them learning anything.The other flaw is that Gary is very brief in his explanations. Even intermediate musicians seem to struggle with content just because some explanations are not exact or vague.",1
It most be more effective,1
"Content is very weak, sounds that are used very annoying...",1
"Very simple, very slow. For someone with programming experience it is a drug, for someone new to programing (I am thinking my son) not very captivating.",1
I don't see how the assignments would make me a more creative person. Some of the content was new and interesting but overall I din't think it was a good use of my time.,1
Examples have to be more clear. i cant seem to get anything correct because of computers,1
"I do not want to rate this course at this stage but I would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text book.For students who do not have a copy of the text book, providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank, ridiculous. I would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.How exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but I would suggest that another downloadable PDF document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.I look forward to a response.Regards, Trevor Farley",1
too hard to follow,1
We tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming. Python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio (nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his life-time idol at a trade-show or watch the Intel versus AMD melt-down commercials over their lunch break).,1
The course modules are too long and at times what the speaker wants to share gets confusing,1
"Very basic, the 'hands on' exercises are not very hands on and do not actually add much value",1
It gives a quick background on Galaxy and its softwares. Content is appropriate but does not prepare you for even the final assignment or real genomic problems.,1
"Very poor material and instruction videos, with no logical flow or process.",1
Good course but not good from coursera to not give honor certificate like it used to give.edx still gives..very disappointed with coursera.,1
Concentrated on image manipulation which would be ok if you wanted to build visual websites for a living. If you want to code anything like business applications (like I did) I wouldn't do this course.Because pixel manipulation wasn't something I was interested in (in the JavaScript section) at all I found the course really boring but it was too late to pull out.,1
"Answers to week 2 are wrong, no forum to discuss it, submitted a case over a month ago - still no reply.",1
"content is not good, too scattered content, cannot find focus.assignments are meaningless.",1
"Honestly, this course was a waste of time. The professor seems to have gathered some information about the version history of iOS and android platforms, thrown it onto some slides, and then reads from those slides. There is no discussion of the context of those technologies.",1
During lessons you don`t receive enough information to be able to pass the exams,1
Not a very good course layout,1
"Too much marketing BS, practically zero valuable information, 5 minute videos (targeted at tinder audience probably?)",1
Could've learnt this on youtube - really not very good. Dr. Egger's courses are rigorous and full of math. This is just a bunch of pretty pictures. Shouldn't be included in this specialization.,1
"This course's content is useful but honestly the final project is ridiculous because it is peer reviewed and the project is not very straightforward. Everyone gets different answers and without an answer key, no one knows what is right and wrong making it is almost impossible to pass. This needs to change.",1
Totally just marketing materials! Don't waste your time with this school at all! You cannot learn a program in a couple of minutes!,1
Need to record the sessions again with more confidence and less errors,1
The intro video just really put me off. sorry!,1
"Watch one or 2 lectures before you join the course, if you felt okay then go ahead, otherwise don't waste your time and money, something wrong in the course structure...",1
"Peer reviewed assignments are a joke. Assignment was ""Not Verified"" which is not possible seeing how before you submit you have to verify assignment.",1
"The course uses a clunky presentation software. Worse than Power Point. Some sections only have one slide and it takes longer to access the slide than it does to read it. There is talk about a book, but I didn't find one within the course. I didn't get past the second section. I figured if the rest of the course was the same, I'd be better off teaching myself with a text book.",1
"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you. If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples). I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk. I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly. Actual quiz question and correct answer: Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired? Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!?While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding. The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top. If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.I'm just hugely disappointed. This course is best suited to perhaps a health department; not to someone seeking college level information about a topic that matters to their children's lives.",1
"The course doesn't allow access to the quizzes unless you pay for it. I consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material. Also, not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless.",1
"If one has taken the Algorithms 1 and 2 course by Profs. Sedgewick and Wayne, this course will be a disappointment and waste of time.",1
Not recommended.,1
"in the beginning of the course i thought i'll get a good experience as usual on coursera, but i was wrong ...a lot of things >> to be introduced in next courseconfusing data types & working with things i don't know about it.you've said that, anyone with basics of programming could pass this course and after 6 months i couldn't.please be sure about the prerequisites next time.",1
"I was very upset by the end of this course. The documentation was terrible. I ended up spending way to much on AWS even though I managed it the best I could Terminating instances. In general, I think this course would have been more fulfilling if the documentation was appropriate.",1
Very simplistic concepts and tactics which are already known to most of us who have been working for a while. It might be useful for somebody who is just starting to work.,1
I waited a long time for this class to start but now that it is here I find it impossible summon enough will to pay attention to the lectures. As a retired teacher I have more of an ability to stick to a class than many but life is too short to wait for this class to perk up. The professors seem very knowledgable but their teaching methodology leaves a lot to be desired.,1
"The course is misrepresented as infographics for all. It is really infographics for journalists WITH experience in Adobe Illustrator. There is no chance that anyone walking into the course with zero experience in AI can pass. No chance, period!The final project grading is unfair & ridiculous. The scoring is ""not good"", ""good"", ""excellent"". Here's the thing... scoring ""good"" equals a fail in the project and, therefore, a fail in the course. Your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors ""excellent"" examples. Not realistic at all.I would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world. Under no circumstances would we use journalistic-style infographics in the business world. Having worked for multiple Fortune 500's, this style would NEVER fly in the business world. I wish I had known before I signed up. I would never have wasted the hours, energy or money.",1
"You know when u see a bunch of good reviews of a restaurant and then go there and the food is terrible, the place is awful and the waiters are the worst?Well, same here:. class structure is messy. communication skills are poor.. i know this is not a design course but the examples shown in html are so bad u think u are watching a course from 2002.. the teacher says ""frustrating"" some many times, and uses so much negative word towards coding and html... maybe she hopes not desencoraje students by empathy but end up doing the exact opposite.i would not recommend this course, not to newbies, not to oldies, not to anyone searching to have a good learning experience.Finishing this course was painfull and i only did it because i promised myself not to abandond it.",1
"Very poor. Assignments consist of transcription of formulae given in lectures, and then manually searching the parameter space for solutions.",1
"Quite confused during the majority of this course, especially after how clear the first course was. Was able to follow instructions but did not fully understand why I was doing anything. Not enough foundation given. The final project came out of no where. We did not learn nearly enough in the course to be able to tackle that. The majority of steps that needed to be taken were not taught in class or if they were, they were glossed over. I was floored by how the class went form simple to extremely complicated with no transition phase.",1
"The material is interesting and new, on that part the instructor is doing a good job.What is really VERY annoying about this course is the fact that in case you have questions/problems relating anything of the course material and you (as said by the instructor) post them to the discussion forums, there is COMPLETELY NO REPLY neither from the instructor, nor from the Coursera.There were obvious mistakes in one of the quizzes and lots of students were posting and discussing this in the forums (as this was actually preventing students from passing the course), but there was no answer whatsoever.I find this very unprofessional, especially because of the fact that this was a paid course. I do not know (and I also do not care) who is responsible for this - Coursera or the instructors, but this is something that should not be present in any of the courses on Coursera.I liked the first course very much, but the mentioned part of the second course was so annoying that I really would not recommend taking this course to new students.Sorry.",1
Not for beginners as promised. You need strong statistical skills to understand it.,1
Instructors are not to be found.,1
"The course is very cheap. However, training material has poor quality.",1
Patronising and very poor in content.,1
"The professors sound like a group of first-year students presenting a group project, literally reading notes off of a powerpoint slide. The professors also can't speak English, so instead of explaining things in depth, they have to very, very slowly read basic phrases (to explain complex subject matter) off of what's basically a teleprompter.",1
the tutorials are outdated. I could not install all the software needed to complete the course nor do I understand what they are used for... too bad. looks like a great course,1
"all video lectures feel like they are just read from a paper and it takes a lot of effort to follow and engage. It is the 4th course I'm taking to get ma digital marketing specialisation and is far off the poorest. The slides don't make much sense and a lot of times I have to research stuff again on other websites to actually get the point. The quiz questions are sometimes not related to the topic. It seems like, the professor does not know enough about the subject to speak freely and engaging about the topics. I'm quite disappointed about this course and can not recommend it. I think the course should be worked over. A great example of how to do it right is Aric Rindfleischs lecture, which was engaging, challenging and very well structured",1
"Personal difficulty in understanding accents, my own lack of ability.",1
"What's the point of online education if one can only access the assignments if him has purchased the course? With no access to assignments, how could one evaluating his efficient of study?",1
"Very badly linked with other websites that provide the actual content. This is more like a click-bait setup than the actual course. I'm not sure why it's even offered on Coursera, other than to make money on a more popular website using the content hosted by less popular one. Very bad experience.",1
It seems the instructor Jack Wu didn't prepare the course material.,1
I can't pass because you don't allow me submit my assignment and asked me to subscribe although this course is paid !!!,1
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
"This course is sorely out of date and in need of a refresh. Using 2012 statistics to describe the state of global terrorism today may be an interesting history lesson, but only serves to show how much more dangerous previously safe regions are today.",1
"That person should not teach. Nobody. The person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course has really little information, but lots of empty talking.",1
Videos aren't of good quality and the tools aren't concrete enough to be useful. There is not enough material. I hope they will improve it because the subject is interesting.,1
A very simplistic and chaotic course. Explanations are all over the place.BlueJ is probably the worst IDE I have ever seen and I have been a programmer for about 8 years.There are far better courses. I would not recommend this course at all.,1
"So close but yet so far ...Course concepts are interesting and the programming assignments are fun but the presentation can be greatly improved.Criticisms include:(i) The course isn't self contained. Physical concepts like 'resultant moment', 'inertial and body-fixed frame' and 'torque' are used without definition. Mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should be.(ii) Lectures are very mathematical but proofs, intuition and good problem sets are all missing. Listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time. Check out John Cochrane's Asset Pricing 1 and 2 or Tim Roughgarden's Algo 1 and 2 for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivations.(iii) Way too much powerpoint! Speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration. I find hand written derivations, even when the handwriting is a little sloppy, much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track. Hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content. Check out Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated material.(iv) The programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material, specifically, the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller. No systematic approach was ever described for performing this task.",1
This course doesn't teach much beyond how to use Galaxy tools.,1
"Didn't like the course though did only one week. In the first week you are supposed to write a research proposal. Though there is a lot of talk on what research is, no actual advice is given on how to write a sound research statement. What's more, with no knowledge on how to do it, you are supposed to assess the works of your peers. I doubt that inexperienced in research beginners will provide valuable feedback - at least I would never do it if I hadn't been quite experienced in that. The second week is devoted to the discussion of the importance of literature review. Isn't that obvious?",1
too hard for a beginner,1
"A giant and complete waste of time. $79, and 1 month of work and it's all Javascript, no java. Worse yet, you are required to work in BlueJ, (google it) with custom Javascript functions that you are not allowed to view or use outside the course. So, none of the code you write in this course will ever be able to be used anywhere else. (The functions probably are in a minified file, but the students were not given access to that file.) A complete waste of time. I would give it ZERO stars but can't submit this rating without giving it one star.",1
Not recommend. Very basic and videos are only 2 - 3 minutes.,1
"I've taken 4-5 courses on Coursera before and always found the quality top notch. Sorry to say but this particular course doesn't even begin to compare. I'm struggling to even get through the first week of videos. I find it unstructured and rather poorly presented. The important concepts that should be explained are being skimmed over but binary terms and concepts are delved into detail. The first two or three videos have an immense amount of repetition: same sentence/content repeated 2-3 times in a different manner. Coursera and the University should seriously consider re-doing this particular course. If I had paid for this, I would've been very unhappy.",1
uses and ancient version of python,1
"This Course is a total scam. In doubt? Sign up for the free version and go watch the videos. Each video is only 1-2 minutes long, so you can watch all 7 weeks in half an hour ( speed 1.5). O, I forgot they also include a link to a 4 years old TED talk, FUn but not really relevant.This course is a disgrace to Coursera. It ought to be removed.",1
i had technical problems with both coursers's online system and also with the 3rd party online coding tool,1
"Some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense, there´s where I wonder if the American people are so unliterate on food issues. The quality of the visual material is also variable, I am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course; another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content.",1
"Content and quizz are not aligned.Mentors answer to 0% of the forum posts.Poor student community.Do not pay for this course, just follow the swirl and/or get some tuto about regressions.",1
There's no point in auditing the course since you don't get access to the answers,1
This course is the worst one in this specialization. The notations are ambiguous and the quizzes are poorly designed.,1
"With all due respect to the lecturer (its obvious that he is intelligent and an expert on the subject), I found this lesson not easy to participate because of inordinate learning curve and fast accent.",1
"Sadly, this course is NOT an Introduction to Swift Programming. As a beginner I found this course was not structured and I was confused about the correct steps to take in order to start programming in Swift. No doubt that these guys are knowledgable but they do not plan the course or teach in a linear fashion. Furthermore the sound and video quality is poor and I have decided to quit this course after the first week and a half.",1
Mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep,1
"Minimal video efforts, not enough content, and long readings. Definetly not a good course to get a verified certificate",1
As a Java programmer with some 18 years industry experience I quickly got lost on this course. It might not be the course - it could be me! It might be that I am too long in the tooth as an OO programmer that I cannot cope with the transition to functional programming.I found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me. But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water. There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like.As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory. And I struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for real-world Scala programming either. I just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types!!! I could write a wrapper for Int in Java in 2 minutes. Doing this abstract Scala exercise would take me all day and I still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it! Whatever happened to maintainability principles ?I have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week 3 I might as well be doing a course in advanced Arabic. I cannot continue this course now because I cannot complete the exercises. I am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of Scala or the course or both. I would be reticent to take a job with Scala.,1
Not the expected quality,1
Not at all what I expected--big disappointment,1
"I dropped out of this course twice is coz i found it absolutely dead. It says positive psychology but it really look so much constraint to even watch the first 3 videos without falling asleep. This is probably the worse course I've studied on coursera. I have studied at least 7 courses on Coursera- of which I loved Social Psychology and Criminal, and I even paid for the certificates. This course literally killed me.... The worst EVER I've come across",1
"I am running Firefox v50 on Ubuntu Linux v16.04. I was unable to watch any of the lecture videos due to the page reloading every 2 - 10 seconds. I tried moving to a different video with the same results. I don't know if this is UC Davis-specific or whether Coursera has changed significantly since the last time I took a class, but this course is totally unusable.I would have left this review with Coursera rather than as a course review, but Coursera doesn't make contact information easy to locate.",1
Professor just re-iterated text and readings. Lectures were poor and provided no insights,1
Much less technical than I had anticipated. Much more policy-driven. Disappointing.,1
"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",1
Th first three classes are very 'thin' in content and the assignments are easy. The fourth class is basically optional and it has TONS of content. What's the point?,1
"Some materials are useful but the teacher has no idea of teaching techniques and good presentation. Very bad choice for the University of Irvin, California to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor. She is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more. Her presentations have no meaning. She does not appear in the video lectures. She can not introduce animated elements. The materials she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant. The most of the materials have only percentages, and small details on history. A course of poor quality.",1
"poorly constructed, too simplistic and too slow",1
"If you are a real beginner like me (having zero or little programming knowledge) and your time is limited, I think this course (or the specialisation) is not suitable for you. The assignments and quizzes are very time consuming. One week I spent literally 30+ hours writing and debugging codes for just one quiz.",1
This capstone is unavailable most part of the year. I paid in advance for the complete Digital Marketing Specialisation which is a 1 year subscription thinking I can complete the course anytime I want (that is how they advertise it). I finished all the theory well within the 2 months into my enrolment. When I came to the capstone project it was unavailable and for almost 3-4 months. When I contacted coursera.org they had no clue when it is going to start. I am a working professional and my schedule gets very busy when I am on projects. And ever since then whenever the capstone is available my schedule has been very busy. I have completed 2 Assignments in capstone and 4 to go and the 1 year subscription is over. Coursera.org says I have to pay for it again to continue which I am never willing to. There is no courtesy to a student/customer who has paid for the course. I have paid in full but I don't have the Digital Marketing Specialisation Certificate. This platform is more about money than education.,1
"This course offered many interesting ideas about flipping school classrooms, but offered no suggestions about the practical methods to do so. As a teacher, I need to have realistic suggestions about the technology necessary to flip my math class, not a series of testimonials about how great it's going to be once my class is flipped.",1
Way too basic for the price - almost no content - this is just setup - I resent paying for setup instructions.,1
"I've spent a bit of time going through the Specialisation (paid for one course here) and other courses online that offer Machine Learning with Python. I looked at books too. I've come to the conclusion that it's unforgivable to teach it using graphlab (that you have to pay for after free licence expiry) when everyone else teaches scikit learn (sklearn) for good reason.The tools used on this course are also not very good.Everyone else teaches using text editors - for a good reason, you learn how to code properly.The lessons are also dry and there are far too many of them.",1
There was no engagement between the course instructors and students at all. It felt like students were running the whole show and discussion forums.,1
Very hard to follow. Needs to clarify more on it's work.,1
"This is a really weak, and not very smart course compared to the other two in this specialisation (strategy formulation & strategy implementation)",1
It's not worth the price.,1
"This is the worst course online I've done so far. I would not recommend it to anyone as it stands, regardless of the student's background, this course is just poor and lacking.The premise of this course is a promising one, the topic is still in its infancy and seems very interesting. Having said that, this is about everything positive that I can say about this course.For starters, the videos seem good at first, but later it becomes very superficial and monotone. The content is many times just rushed through and it's visible that the lecturers at several occasions have difficulty even to read their own slides!However, the worst part of the course are the quizzes. There are 24 graded quizzes in total, to pass the course you need to pass all 24 of them! To make matters worse, the minimum passing marks for each quiz is 80%, that wouldn't have been such an issue if most quizzes had 5 or more questions, which is not the case, most of the quizzes have 4 or less questions. This is such an unreasonable requirement, if you miss only one question in a quiz with 3 questions there's already no chance to pass the course!The content of each quiz is also very troublesome, we are essentially being graded for trivia, a considerable number of the questions are very superficially related to not related at all to the subject of each lecture. Instead of using the questions to delve deeper into the topic at hand, they only create confusion with futilities. A little example, the topic of a subject was about the mechanical properties of using multiple templates and a question in its quiz was about an electric circuit that is never shown in the question itself, only briefly shown in the lecture video for about 10s, minimal information is given without any explanation of what they mean and we are asked to enter a formula as the answer for which also almost no information is given about which notation we should use for the formula itself.There are other cases where there are multiple choice questions which have incorrect answers accepted by the grader. In one instance, two of the options available are contradictory to each other, however the accepted answer was the one involving both. In another instance, there was more than one solution available to an answer, however the grader accepted only one and there was no information in the question itself to narrow down the possible answers to the desired one.Finally, there is no active community by the TA and professors, I have never had a single answer form a TA or professor, only sporadical replies from a mentor, who has no authority to fix any issue by him or herself.All these issues just point to how poorly this course was designed. It had such high hopes, but they fell short flat. In doing this course, I found myself reverse engineering most of the questions just to try to find an accepted answer and try to understand what it meant. The imposed 8-hour period between attempts at the quizzes only hindered my progress. I was focused and engaged in studying for each quiz, however, after 3 failed attempts I had an imposed break period that makes little sense. In the end, this course only made me feel like the very object of my learning: a robot.I am really disappointed with this course.",1
Too many speakers. Not very well-coordinated or organized. Very wordy and diffuse. Where is the gist of what they are saying in so many words?,1
"Incorrect references, subtitles that do not follow the video. Questions in the questionnaires that have not been studied and which one does not even know where to find references. The worst course of this certificate.",1
Linking programming language to hardware sucks. Do not waste time on this course.,1
"The Worst Course EVER on Coursera:It is important to realize at the outset that I am a very avid learner and always give everything a chance to be completely tried out before giving a judgement, and unfortunately, this course is by far, the only bad course I've encountered on Coursera for the following reasons:1- The professor wastes a whole week's module on explaining something trivial like the interest rate and compound interest rate without naming the necessary terminology that is commonly used.2- To make things worse, he has a condescending perspective on students and wastes so much time glorifying himself in an upsetting manner that patronizes learners.3- His demeanour is unprofessional and quite disturbing when he gives mentions at the end of the week that 'I can feel you. I can feel each one of you now' to the degree that even the camera-person filming him cuts his nonsense out.4- After putting up with all his boring nonsense that I already know, despite being a linguist not a finance person, I gave him a chance and started doing his first 10-question Quiz, which was completely isolated from reality and unrelated to his course material or teaching.5- All questions were boring and calculation-intensive, and I still gave him and a chance and went through the whole boring set of 10 questions just to tell me that it needs upgrading for such a banal and facile course.Now, I have an idea about the level of Teaching at Michigan University and I will recommend all my friends not to attend such a university due to the previously-mentioned reasons.A complete waste of space.",1
non-rich course!,1
"This course is a discreditation to coursera, and it's low standards are appalling. From a purely certificate based perspective, the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes. They are short, and can easily be googled, or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply CRTL+F for keyboards. There is zero need to watch the lectures ( at least for the first 2 weeks).The lectures are terrible themselves. The English is beyond horrible, and I don't understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they can't speak. It is purely reading off the slides in any case, word for word. I learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a 20 minutes lecture from a separate course, ""Computational Neuroscience"" than the entire first week here.If you actually want to learn neuroscience, check out HardvardX's intro course.",1
Need English Version Please,1
"The course is very interesting but there is a problem with the quizzes, it doesn't accept correct questions. If needed I can provide a screen shot of the problem in one of the quizzes. Hope that all this will be fixed and I'll be able to take the course again.",1
Too simple to be realistic,1
"Not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background. I prefer to use R to do the modeling things, while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools.",1
This is not a course - each session is 4 mins or less...,1
the videos are too longassignments are difficultand dr asfahani is not like dr larryi loved dr larry much moredr asfahani is not interesting in his presentations at all,1
"too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders",1
Get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research. For being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the videos of the course are not a great help.,1
"After the excellent first course in the specialisation, this was quite a disappointment.I realise that the subject matter in this course will inevitably involve abstract concepts and subjective opinions, but I didn't really 'get' the way that Casey was presenting the subject given that there were quizzes and assignments to follow.That's not to say that the videos aren't interesting. But, given their rambling style, they would be much more useful as reference material rather than driving the course, in my opinion.Many of the questions in the quizzes felt like they'd been added simply to make them up to the correct number. Some were so loose that you could write any answer and I'm sure you'd get a mark!Also, I'd say not to even start this course unless you have a clear idea for a game. The assignments require you to produce design documents that are tedious, going on impossible, to write without some firm rooted idea to start from.Maybe if you really want to be a game designer then this will be the course for you. If you are doing the course out of curiosity, for fun, or to learn how to control Unity, I'd give it a miss.",1
Bad sound quality,1
"Shame on you University of Houston SystemI did the first three lessons, which are less than average, then went on to quiz 1, after completion, a window appeared to ask me for money to get my results! This information should have been provided when I enrolled! I find that very mis leading.",1
This course did not motivate me at all. Videos where mainly repetitive and the questions seemed to be there to serve no purpose.,1
Not for the basic student looking for information. Very detailed,1
I'm getting coursera verification prompts too often. This doesn't happen in any of the other courses I've taken/I'm taking,1
Not holding my interest. Sorry!,1
This course was uninspiring,1
"The teachers doesn't seem to enjoy beeing there.......... The all seem like ''The faster we do this, the sooner it will be finished....''",1
"Except the fact that it was taught well, I believe that pressuring people work with a specific program to pass a course is not helpful. I believe that instead of learning how to handle PRO TOOLS from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instruments, measuring the studio space, monitors and much more helpful things than advertise and make AVID richer.FriendlyAll the best",1
The instructor just rambles on and on... there is no structure to the lectures.,1
"The course is very bad and feels thrown together at the last minute. Learning A* and Dijkstra's algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to ""discovery"" techniques not even mentioned in the course material. In addition, you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments. You must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides. Meaning that beginners will NOT pass this course. The automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail. This is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but, the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for. This is really atrocious. Although the TA's do occasionally provide answers to questions. The total amount of time TA's spend answering questions is just really poor. Don't expect even well asked questions to be answered at all. In addition, the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together. You will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as to what went wrong. Sadly, enough all of these issues have caught up with me and I was unable to pass assignment 2 part 2. Even, though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases. The grader is merciless. Perhaps, in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and I can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader. At this time I don't feel like my money was well spent on these courses. I don't think I would like to risk another 50 dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization. That is very disappointing as I really am passionate about learning robotics and looked forward to the other courses as well.",1
"Poor presentation skills (mostly reading slides)Unclear and inconsistent in what pre-requisite knowledge is needed for the course (in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic, but then later he assumes you know hardware languages, fpga design, etc.).Was a waste of time, shame on Coursera that pre-requisite knowledge was removed from the site.",1
"If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt.The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll ""build applications"" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper. However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities. If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of. Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.",1
Just boring lectures.After 30 minutes I was finish with the course.The course is very superficial. The instructor also speaks to fast. Sounds like she just read a text trough.,1
"Bad logic.Class content poorly related to the exams. No exercise for practice. When any, clearly unrelevant. The first 4 weeks, it is hard to impossible to succeed through the exam. Run all videos set first, then consider digging into practice.I took a book and learned more form it than this video.",1
make the other ones free,1
"I don't recommend this course. The lectures barely touch on the topics being taught, you are expected to go learn on your own. I learned more from the free Khan academy than from this course. It would have been worth more buying good literature on algorithms.",1
"Not very informative content, some parts are interesting but not worth the money.The worst thing is, all assignments are writting work that are evaluated by colleagues, meaning, it is purely objective, to the extent that one question asks if my uploaded file is in a readable format, example pdf, txt...etc and two out of three marking my pdf file as not!!! and not even leaving a comment why they are giving that bad score on obvious things!",1
"Again a course that comes with very simple (and not always good prepared) video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary, with no further help given",1
"I took up to week 2 and, so far, this course assumes statistics knowledge. I expected it would provide a background on the rather than just run a code and show the results.",1
"Bad video quality, errors in tasks and descriptions, no clear path through the course.",1
"Very short and just a basic overview on how to install a few tools that most of them I already had installed. All this course content could be packed into an introductory lesson instead of having to pay for it. I abandoned the specialisation because of this, I know it's a big business but at least you need to offer some value for the money",1
Badly taught,1
Week 3 application assignment is buggy. If you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect. You must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for. It's a badly designed assignment that wastes students' time and creates a lot of frustration. Would not recommend the course because of it.,1
"Easiest accounting common sense. If you ever took acct , this will be a wasting of time.",1
Unable to start the course. The page re-loads again and again in an endless loop!,1
This course had almost no lectures. It was almost all done in downloadable PDF's that were rarely discussed in the lectures. I never learned why anything happened.,1
First course by David Rossiter set the bar very high. This is like going through a manual or series of instructions. Would like 2 courses to be taken by David and 2 by Jogesh...Else the style becomes very monotonous. The course by David was awesome. This is not as good,1
"Lightweight and marginally informative. While it is clearly aimed at a lay audience, a deeper presentation of the scientific foundations of the disorder is sorely needed. If you're interested in the etiology of autism, you'll need to look elsewhere.",1
"The videos lag behind, and the readings the first one of the first week, the link was broken",1
"This course is useless and perhaps even harmful.The professors would have done much better if they had taught the class in their native Chinese language and then got a really good translator to make subtitles in English.I tried turning off the sound and just watching the presentation while reading the subtitles, but even this was so badly done in terms of language and presentation, that although I desperately wanted to take a course in advanced neurobiology, I felt that this course could actually destroy my love for the subject or teach me things that are incorrect because of language mistakes.If you are not a native speaker of English then by all means steer even further clear as you will learn some very bad English habits and pronunciation.I'm sure the profs' English ability is fine for collaborating with other professionals who already know the material, but teaching in English was a big mistake.Again, I highly suggest they re-do the entire thing in Chinese and get really good translations and subtitles made and then I think it could be an awesome course. Now, as is, it would be truly foolish to take this course.",1
This course doesn't offer much of a learning curve. I would rather suggest taking Data Visualization Using Tableau by Duke University.,1
"It is really basic course, I expected much more even if this is offered only for $29.. (the cheapest course in the specialisation)",1
"The course gives some ideas about time management. However, it takes more time utilising these methods of planning, checking the plans, planning extra work and risks than actually do the work.It is impossible to multitask, let's go back to monotask.",1
"I'm sorry but the presentations were very poor and unprepared.The first quiz focused on rather unimportant and stuff which was NOT PRESENTED in videos, like keyboard shortcuts etc.Do not recommend.",1
"This is part 2 in the robotics specialization. The course content is way too short and basic for the price. There are about 77 minutes of lecture in total, i.e. less than 20 minutes per week. The first week covers BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, something part of most undergrad programs. The rest of the material is ok but very basic. The programming assignments are ""implement Dijkstra"" in week 1, ""implement Dijkstra on a Torus"" (and ""do triangles intersect?"") in week 2, a very simple for loop in week 3, and ""implement gradient descent"" in week 4. I could complete the course by looking at it on-and-off over one weekend.The material that is presented is presented well, but there's not enough of it.For reference, part 1 of the robotics specialization had over twice as much lecture content (by time) and then lots of supplementary material in addition to that, quizzes that required some thinking, and more relevant and at least slightly harder programming assignments.",1
Prof is simply reading from slides. No value-added,1
"This is way too esoteric. The content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it. This needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples. I'm also not sure why, if auditing, we can't submit and see how we're doing on the learning. I have no way to evaluate if I'm picking up the concepts or not, which is a struggle. Overall, I would not recommend this course for R beginners. I would look elsewhere.",1
"Poorly designed assignment on data modeling did little to expand my knowledge on the topic. Which is a shame since the individual lectures were well done and very interesting. The ""Pink Flamingo"" peer-peer-reveiwed exercise needs to go.",1
The course is not very useful due to its lacking of practical examples and assignments.,1
Actually I feel like i'm reading the instruction manual without knowing useful skills,1
Way to easy,1
"I wouldn't give a star for this course; materials are prosaic (wordy); professors have not designed a truly high-tech course with automated grading; they want peers to grade each other - I don't like this euphemism, which is equivalent to the blind leading the blind; I do not want to spend my energy correcting other peoples' programming assignments; I want to spend the time thinking about programming and working on my own programs - the concept of collaboration is false - everyone wants to develop their own stuff not share with others so the premise of the course is inaccurate; also, the course has many long-winded texts of little use to the student; this is a course more about indoctrination in a legacy system than it is a course to liberate the mind through computers; while the content is interesting I am completely turned off by the amount of time I have to devote to commenting on other peoples' stuff - I am not a teacher - that is the teacher's job not my job - also, I do not like the condescension and clownishness of the profs in this course - I do not need to be entertained and all the talk about Monty Python, one of the corniest programs on TV trivializes the material - a no-nonsense, MIT type course is preferable - this is a course that I would avoid from the logistical perspective, although I will follow the material side of the course because it has substantial content and that includes the specialization - hello teachers in the course - automate the grading and remove all of the peer evaluations and start offering authentic instruction, not lazy instruction of students teaching students - the approach is typical of all legacy-oriented courses - the same goes for the Severance course at the University of Michigan - if the Rice course is supposed to instill interest in Rice University, this offering turns me away from Rice because one realizes that Rice is too legacy-oriented in its approach, same old, same old.",1
"I have met with nothing but frustration with this course. Though the lectures are understandable, but the readings are comparable but unrelated to the material in the lectures. I also had no kind of communication with instructors, TAs, or other student for help. It is ridiculous that there is NO feedback forums, and this seems to be the only course that handles it that way. If this an institutional decision to not have feedback, it seems that these instructors and/or the University of California, Irvine do not care to help students. I would not recommend this to anyone!",1
Far too academic. Nothing of substance but lists. I'm not here for monotonous lectures.,1
"Way to basics, just to much explication but nothing actually to implement or to do.",1
Difficult to follow with no live coding.,1
The course is very short and more advanced courses are not free.,1
cheap !!! just money involved in each subsectionswhich r the most interesting parts,1
"I really like the lectures of this course. But on the other hand this programming assignments are...I am not able to see why using such a complicated main code template is useful to understand the principals of the finite element method. I spend 5 hours for trying to install all the libraries and finding the correct header files of deal.II and this visualization thing which is needed in the write_output.h file). Because otherwise you will not be able to compile the code. This is not the first time I did installation of complicated code in unix and I know by heart this can be cumbersome sometimes.But why doing this for a simple programming assignment. I started this course because I want to learn about finite element method and not how to install deal.II software. But exactly installing is what the first assignment is about it is not about coding what will be only a small fraction of the whole assignment then.And the next thing is there is not only one person facing this troubles there are quite a lot if you look in the discussion forums.On the other hand if there would be sufficient help given for the installation it would be fine, but it is not.The only help which is given are sending some links which is nice. But links I can also watch by myself.So I really liked this course and found it interesting ( or I still find it interesting ), but I don't see what learn effect I should have from messing around with those deal.II libraries.",1
It´s a requirement to put down a payment to take the quiz,1
"$38 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software. This course takes only 20 minutes to complete. It is also obsessed with command line interfaces. There's a reason that they were left behind in the 80s. It does cover GUI software like Rstudio, which is ignored for the rest of the course. How about something on the desktop Github version? https://desktop.github.com/ So much easier to use.",1
"It's very simple presentation for the topic. I believe that coursera is a Professional site for learners. So , I don't think people who visit this site don't know these basic rules. I mean what is to, CC, subject or stuff like these. I thought, the course give us more specific materials that we able to use when we write an email, for example, inside of the mail what rules we have to consider or what words or Word structures we should use.",1
"Very difficult to apply the knowledge without some support material with the content, e.g. PPT slides.",1
For people who don't know programming at all only.,1
"Videos are poorly edited (too much blank space, the bullet points are not clearly visible, there is no narrative or discursive structure, the diagrams are not clear, and the interviews are raw and unedited). Sessions are too long and include too much irrelevant information. The little useful information there is, is not structured clearly and thus it's harder to learn. The material for the first 3 weeks resemble more to someone talking about ""the good ol' days"" rather than a properly thought-out history class. I had to leave the course as I found it to be a waste of my time, and I am glad I decided not to pay for a certificate for it. My expectations were a lot higher for a University course.",1
Poorly prepared course. Lectutets do not have enough qualified to teach others. It's a shame to pay for this money. I do not expect this from the university of Toronto.,1

I did not find the lectures at all informative and the readings were not targeted enough to understand what items required focus and what information was more background. I did not find the course especially helpful.,1
"the only reason to take this course is because the certification will look good on your resume. don't expect to learn anything new if you are already in IT or related field. i passed the tests without going over the material. there is a shortage of original content, although their graphics and effects department did a good job, and mostly they expect you to read outside resources.audit the course for free to get familiar with the content but only pay if you need the certification for professional reasons.",1
poor quality and even worse presentation by the teacher,1
Instead of These Classes Spiritual Classes will be good ...,1
"Originally, I rated this course 3-stars. However, I have since decided it is worth 1-star after taking the next course in the series, Bootstrap. I thought that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material to make this course good. After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order. However, it takes thinking, planning, and dedication. I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhaul. After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignments that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school.The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe. Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course. While there are supplementary readings, Coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page Wiki style coverage of a topic.",1
Too much theory less practical things.,1
"After the first week, the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums. The capstone project itself was disappointing, I learned much more from doing my own app in class #3.I took the Coursera Android specialization, which was eons better than this. I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone. I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto.",1
very boring and didn't learn anything i didn't already know. this was more like watching an anti drug propaganda film that I couldn't finish it.,1
"In my opinion, most of this information should be free and available as a pre-req. for other classes (installing R Studio).It was cheap, but in general, I thought I was going to be more out of this course than I did.",1
The slides are unclear and very very ugly and old style.The assignment is very specific to Linux based machine.Only one programming assignment.More theory than practices.The QCMs don't really help understand. They are just about remembering values.I woudn't recommande this course since it is more like a book then it is like a course.,1
"The lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical. Pretty good. Everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create. Not so great, I think. It is not free (you get a one year licence) and hides all the action from the user. I don't like that the course then makes me feel that I must rely on a specific product to solve problems.",1
very redundant and lacks diversity,1
They taught NOTHING!,1
"I learned next to nothing from this course; the professor just rambles on and on jumping schizophrenically from aspect of aspect. One moment he's talking about physics, and in the same sentence he's suddenly talking about whether the game should have a crafting system. Some of the information even seems out of touch.He doesn't state any information with certainty because he always tends to add ""or not!"" or ""...maybe!"" after sentences, leaving you to wonder if there's anything left to take away from the lessons. The entire course could be condensed down into a ""list of questions to think about while designing your game world"" - it really doesn't contain anything more than that.Sometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things (such as ""your game could have invisible walls!""), whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going in-depth to any of them.Speaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficiency with the English language and the subtitles are often incorrect.On the plus side, you will learn what a ""ha-ha"" is.",1
"I paid the course and the course seem to be no longer supported, I tried without success to switch session , in summary : You paid and don't get to follow the course, incredible :-( ....... !",1
Extremely boring teacher,1
"Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations. Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required. Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context.",1
"Not even sure it worth one star, all due respect.",1
Needs to pay for submit assignments,1
I don't need the teacher to read Aristotle for me. Reading is not Teaching.,1
"ridiculous , unscientific 'self-helpie"", far below of even talk-show standards. It gives bad reputation to any business school that endorses such ""course"".""",1
Bad quality slides and presentation. not possible to use headphone since it was on mono not stereo. Interesting topic but not well executed to fit online learning,1
"Material is really interesting and helpful, but a lot of bugs in video productions.",1
"very hard for beginners, very boring for others. also missleading concepts",1
So academic... Interview with students has no value and no point.,1
Sways between incorrect definitions and buzz words to word dense academic papers. Lacks clarity to the point of bringing the providers expertise in to question (only those who understand a concept and have relevant experience have a hope of explaining it) . Calls in to question the motive of the course and coursera - this seems more like marketing or pre-sales than it does education.,1
"Mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around. The ""Agile"" buzzword in its best and most ""religious"" form.",1
"Completely lost. This is not meant for rank beginners. Data Camp's free R course has been much more helpful for me than this. It doesn't have the same level of detail as this, but at least I'm not watching an instructor gloss over concepts or ideas that are completely foreign to me as someone completely new to programming.",1
low-level content for people with no teaching background,1
"The videos were very tedious and convoluted, in addition to being outdated. Almost all of the methods were deprecated by the time I was taking this course. I wouldn't recommend this course at all.",1
very dissapointing to not be able to make the quizzes and the assigments without paying it,1
Rudimentary HR / new supervisor level information. Not specific to Data Science either.,1
"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1
Complete waste of time. I could learn the interview skls anywhere.,1
"For such a terrible course to then change payment terms without my authorisation. Take $64 from my account without telling me clearly amongst all the other junk mail. Coursera have a lot to answer for, and this specialisation is not even worth wasting your time if it was free.Taught without purpose; meaningless instructions given to copy without regard of the bigger picture.",1
"While the lectures were a little slow about providing information, they were entertaining.But I feel very mislead about the costs. The lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but, in the end, only the first course in the series is free. Then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go on.I would not have continued with the first course if I'd known that was all there was going to be.",1
material was good but it doesn't tell you to pay for the course until you take the quiz,1
Poorly constracted course!,1
This is a joke.,1
Inaccuracies and low level of engagement.,1
"Nice form, shallow content. Simply too simple. Beware: upgrade / fee required for last two exams.",1
"Quizzes kept requiring information that was oddly specific (needing an exact decimal number without multiple choice options), which would have been okay except that it was not covered in the lectures. Ended up dropping course because there is no way to get through the quizzes if the information is not covered.",1
Too short to get any depth of information. Too expensive for the content provided.,1
"Content is very condensed - but fine.However, you need to pay to do the quizzes and even the peer assessment - something where you are contributing by reviewing other participants work. Charging me for supporting other participants and supporting a 'learning community mindset' seems ridiculous to me.",1
Very US centered and assignment not well connected to the lecture,1
It's format needs a good narrator not based on stupid commercials.,1
"Poorly organized course. The lectures seemed to jump around from one point to another. In some cases, way too much detail; in others, not nearly enough.The subtitles have so many errors that they are virtually useless.",1
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
"Half of the links to external readings and videos did not work, which is the reason I did not complete the course. It made taking the quizzes fairly impossible unless I wanted to spend my time googling the answers.",1
"Poorly designed, executed and instructed. Too much is left off the materials.",1
bad coarse unclear one,1
Very bad course.,1
The least comprehensive course I ever took. It needs very good prerequisite about computer vision. And the demostration was very poor.,1
"This course, was really bad structured, was often the discrepancy between the information provided in the videos and the questions in the Quiz. Also a lot of time the system was very picky to take an answer like correct, just because the format used, for example e!=E in one equation, and because this was necessary a lot of guessing in order to find how the system take the answer by correct.But really the worst was the discrepancy between the video and the quiz, because my impression is that the videos were cut to fix in the time, but they were cut a lot, missing important information to be used in the quiz.",1
"This review is for Coursera. Why you want me to click 2 times to submit a review? On home screen when i click on stars to review, new window opens.. This is not a great UX.. Please reduce no of clicks that a user has to make to submit the reviews.",1
"It very short and brief. I was thinking it will also emphasise and help us to grow our communication skills for the 21st century communication, but it's just a brief explanation of some changes and nothing more.",1
"This course tells you to use a timer while studying without the TV on and to avoid procrastination. It also stresses review while learning. This isn't anything new. The course discusses diffuse and focused modes. Diffuse modes are described as being as important as focused modes. Running, day dreaming and sleep can help enter diffuse modes and integrate focused learning. Save you time and skip this course.",1
till week 2 i think there is no useful information till now,1
Not worth wasting your time over: they state that which is blatantly obvious and provide little insight into human factors of security.,1
"Worst course I took on Coursera so far! It was my first course I actually paid for and it turned out to be the least useful one. The small number of exercises and videos does not justify the high price of the course. It might have been ok if they had included the iOS parts also, but charging 70 EUR for the first part alone is grossly overpriced.",1
"It says 'advanced writing' but it is advanced for college students, not advanced overall. I found it extremely basic.",1
"This is not a start, at the end of the course, you still can't use python. And even the tools don't work properly.",1
"The code teacher used is out of maintenance, students have to spend a lot of unnecessary time fix it. Even I have purchase it and finished week 1-3, I still chose to drop out. Not great learning experience. :(",1
"Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics. The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data. There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone. I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help. I'm sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course, but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience.",1
worst course of the specialization.,1
too easy,1
"Course contained unbelievable amount of silly busywork that has no place being implemented in MATLAB, while forbidding the use of most useful built in functions. At no point during the course was any of the MATLAB's strengths -- like easy solving of linear systems or vectorized operations, even suggested upon.Furthermore, the course has unhealthy interest in dates and calendars - again of course disabling all the built in tools.",1
"NOTHING like described, NOT EASY for non native english speakers as describedextremely misleading..",1
"They don't give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments, unless they could offer addicional material.",1
"teacher talks much too slowly, and uses many complex terms when they are not needed",1
"Only shows a bit of javascript, css, and html snippets. If you expect to learn from this course, dont bother they mostly refer you to w3schools.com. They assume everyone knows how to code in html, javascript and css. At one point in the course the teacher says, if you don't know: Google, Yahoo,etc., but if you are going to have to google 99% of things, it's pointless taking this course.",1
"just begun, but so far so good. I will update the stars as the weeks progress!!",1
"This course is good but instructor is very bad..... Not providing good course lectures and materials... The lecture is very fast and not covering all the things being asked in the assignment... I am leaving this course due to this.. I have successfully done other python courses, because there, the instructor was very good and his teaching style was awesome...I have wasted lot of my times enrolling in this particular course... Though the course conception is good, instructor and course materials are not up to the mark....",1
They say that if you don't have anything good to say it's better not to say anything at all.,1
A little devoid of depth.,1
Please get a more enthusiastic prof,1
The certificate doesn't show hours per week and the topics we did during the course. I paid for an empty paper.,1
"Extremely badly organized, messy, and technical",1
I would not recommend this course. It was very poorly planned and seemed thrown together.,1
I dont recommend this course to anyone.The course content is not up-to-the mark.,1
I am just not feeling this course. I have done up to week five and still am not hooked. Sorry!,1
No translations available despite what subtitles and transcripts say.,1
"It does allow the purchase of a specific course within the specialization, the student has to subscribe to the all specialization even if they are only interested in one course only. Secondly the owner of this course should have allowed at the assignment to be submitted, because some people purchase a course only right after they have completed it.",1
"I want to bring it to Coursera's attention that this specialization on Conflict Management is poor quality, poor value and hardly any content. Week 1 is only a welcome lecture!! It is a 3-4 week course stretched out to 3 months so that students can be charged money $$$.It should not be a paid specialization. It does not meet Coursera's high standards. Can you please forward this review to the right person?",1
"Course material was interesting but very rudimentary, the courses biggest challenge was understanding its spoken English. I do not recommend this course.",1
"This requires a high level understanding of maths (highest high school level) especially SI, and exponents. It is not suitable for people with no background in maths or physics",1
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
Teacher is boring. just learned programming from kahn academy and the teacher was excited to teach. this guy though.....PUT A LITTLE EFFORT IN!,1
"Course title is misleading. It is actually a course on Managing Agile Software development, not Product management.There is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market. Market is not mentioned in this course at all.What requirements and schedule, guys??? Current product management is all about hypotheses, A/B testing, customer development, experiments, lean UX, etc.You completely missing the point.Still, this course can be a good one for those who want to start Managing agile software development.",1
"It is a great effort to try to explain writing an academic paper. I appreciate it. And unfortunately, these guys have an awful English accent. It is almost impossible to understand. Moreover, their sentences are so long and complicated that makes it impossible to get it. Nice try but it doesn't work :(Best regards,Dr. Furkan",1
"There's no support from the staff. The staff is completely absent in the recent discussion forums, it seems they have abandoned the course few months ago.You have your assignments evaluated by only one peer, and that doesn't protect your final grade from wrong evaluations.",1
"Could have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches. Only 3 panning approaches discussed in 4 weeks, thus disappointing.",1
The course cost too much for the gain of knowledge. Feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course.,1
"autograder will not accept my valid code that contains all valid elements, will not make the deadline so will not bother continuing.",1
Not professional at all!,1
"This course is a rare example of how it`s not done. Presentation is unstructured.Seems to be a student project where his professor ""helps"" along to check certain topics the student has to include to get a good grade.",1
"Very poor lecture, I barely learn anything about excel from this course. The course title is quite mis-leading",1
NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself. I would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation! Through all the courses I worked hard only to reach NLP capstone? this doesn't feel right! Please fix it!,1
"First, the instructor assumes that the students know so much background knowledge when the students are expecting to learn these stuff in the course. I also feel that this course teaches students to memorize steps needed to accomplish certain operations in Galaxy without explaining why it occurs.",1
"The technical support of this course is just terrible: just like many many other students (see the Discussion forums), I have experienced serious difficulties to access the databases platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignments. I can only echo the innumerable complains from my co-students about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course; many of us are very unhappy about this, especially as they have paid for this course ... and what is Coursera doing about it, by the way?My advice: beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization, and search for alternative options (there are many, not only on Coursera but also on EdX and others ...)!!!",1
"This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.",1
"To difficult to enjoy, unfortunately.",1
"Course content: some Swift specific topics are shortly covered in the videos. Overall, the teaching material is very short. In the first week, students basically learn how to start Xcode. Week four contains a 15 minutes video on image processing, that's basically it for the week.Follow-up readings for week two just provide a link to Apple's iOS Developer site. That's clearly not enough for a course. Students can google for tutorials by themselves.Project: The projects mentions classes, which are not covered in the course. It was then also my impression from the peer reviews, that some students without prior knowledge were just lost.There are many great tutorials on the web which offer more insights and give students a much more fundamental knowledge than this course.",1
"Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful, when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn't place any emphasis into it. So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all. Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like ""Eat3D"" and many others out there, which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here! It needs to be deeper and more robust if this course wants to stand out, right now is not.",1
Use of Duke own specialised librarie ~ not the best way of learning progamming for the real world.,1
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.,1
Starting it now.,1
The accents of the instructors make it difficult to understand the material,1
"I'm dropping out of a specialisation I paid for because the quality of the materials is really low, and the presentation is very similar. I don't want to discourage the presenters, but this is not the level I expected.",1
The course is almost about nothing. It seems to me that the teacher didn't make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse. After 8 weeks of Arduino-related courses I've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters of Arduino Starter Kit book.,1
"Very little of use in this course. A lot of academic mumbo jumbo that is totally useless when confronted with the infinite investment opportunities. The student is presented with a number of time consuming/wasting formulas to apply to the decision process.If one ACTUALLY used those formulas, one would still be waiting to buy the first stock.A question from the Week 4 test will demonstrate just how useless this course is:The Situation: ""You invested to maximize your wealth over a one year period. You are eagerly anticipating the returns after the first month.""The Question: ""What part of your brain is being activated?""What's Wrong with this?First of all, who invests in order to make it big in one year. You are trading if that is your goal.Second: who gives a flying fig about what part of the brain is engaged? What am I supposed to do with the answer? How does this, in the least, help me make better investment decisions.I'm done. I was going to take all the courses in this specialization. No more. Waste of time and money.",1
No instructor participates in discussion. No one ever passes the programming assignment because it won't accept any answer.,1
"Poorly designed videos, too long and confused",1
Have to say: this course is not useful,1
I'm sorely disappointed. I learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that I didn't get a good feel for Tableau. I paid $20 elsewhere (UDEMY) and I'm learning a SHIT TON about Tableau through them. Tableau has great free resources too that are better than what I paid $80 for on Coursera. This class is a joke and not worth $80. As a UCD Alumni I'm embarrassed my school's name is on this.,1
"One way (approach) to 'teaching' data shows only that you know data but haven't designed multiple ways of teaching it. No, feedback from instructors, directly, makes it hard to obtain conceptual understandings. ie, as soon as you become lost with the one-way taught week, no way to grasp the following weeks. There could be a higher rate of success AND enjoyment of learning, if more thought were put into 'How to teach' the material. Been playing music for over 30 years and am failing from week 4 on. This shouldn't be as confusing as Coursera has made it. Disappointed and DISCOURAGED!",1
"No guidelines for peer review assessments, technical issues, very clunky website.",1
Primitive and useless,1
I expected more coding examples.,1
"In my opinion:The topics reviewed were too haphazardly selected.The citations for quoted research were hard to impossible to find,The course focused disproportionately on the lecturer's commercial ventures.",1
"In my opinion this is not a course. The contents are a short interview cut up over 4 weeks, fluffed with a myriad of vendor-biased PDFs. The 90s classroom style video editing is annoying to boot.",1
"I thought this course would teach art appreciation,but seems geared towards Teachers.",1
"Quizzes don't match what's been taught in the video lectures. Very poorly-designed questions, where there is more than one correct answer.",1
"too fast paced, not suited for absolute beginners. first week takes alone about 3 weeks to complete and master",1
"Too many animal mistreatment clips were shown, also some gross misstatements of biological-scientific truths and widely held facts. Humans cannot change the genome of any living creature, DOGS are WOLVES and always will be. We have domesticated and bred for certain personality traits and characteristics. Done with your course.",1
"I'm unimpressed with the quality of the material and uninspired by the professor's video presentations. Out of the dozen or more courses here that I have taken, this one ranks at the bottom. I'm not going to disenroll at this time, but I have lost interest without even progressing beyond the first week. Maybe if I get inspired later, I will try again.",1
"I found the content and the presenters much less engaging than in ""Developing Innovative Ideas for New Companies: The First Step in Entrepreneurship"". The exams were so easy that I could pass them at 100% without watching most of the videos. I really don't have the feeling that I learned much that would help me in getting ""From Idea to Marketplace"". Overall disappointing for a paid course.",1
"The course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons. In the test of Lesson 7 we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer. This is never mentioned in the course.The question does not have a unique yes/no solution. It depends on the context, in particular on the audience of the analysis and report. If I'm talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful, on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusing.How are we supposed to know this?This is just one example, but all the courses of the EDS specialisation had these issues. I don't know if it is a language barrier or what but I feel that I didn't have a chance to study more to get a better score. You either happen to have the same idea of the teacher or you don't, and this is not professional.",1
The high video production values of this course fail to hide the abysmal lack of content. With approximately 4 mins per week of video charging $49 for this course is a disgrace. Potential students should save their money and read the relevant Wikipedia pages.,1
Professor needs to emphasize on basics before going advance.,1
Very poorly organised material and illustration,1
"I would give this course 0 stars if possible.I am amazed that anyone rated this course better than 1 or 2 stars!The lectures are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignments.The assignments are poorly written and demand too much Ruby expertise for a course meant for Ruby novices. I spent over 15 hrs trying to complete week 2's assignment and still could not finish. I became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed I decided to quit. Coursera should not allow there to be courses that evoke such frustration and emotion. John Hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization series.Foolishly, I paid for the entire specialization up front and Coursera refuses to refund me for the remaining two courses. (which I have not even taken)",1
"Videos proceed way too fast for complete beginners and things are explained without enough underlying basics. Plus there is not really enough chance for repetitions in the videos. Tonal explanations are good, except for the green line where you are not told how to choose what part of that tone to pronounce every time. Overall, it could be a great course but falls short because the videos proceed way too fast and without enough repetitions or even practice exercises to be able to remember the phrases afterwards.",1
"Few content, bad quality, many mistakes in the material, no programming assignments, poor support.Definitely not worth the money.",1
"The course is very disappointing and useless. The two lecturers are not explaining anything properly, they are just showing slides and handing out links.The only useful part of the course is Module 4, which is outside the scope of the course and taught by guest lecturers.I would not spend time on this course and instead find another source for learning WordPress.",1
I felt more like I was part of some experiment to see how long I could tolerate boredom than that I was in class where someone was trying to share knowledge with me. Needless to say I did not make it to the end which is sad because I was genuinely interested in the content. The instructor's delivery was absolutely monotone and he did not seem to emphasize the key points in any way so I found it very difficult to retain any information or to even stay awake at times.,1
"I was so excited for this course, but IT failed miserably. I am a complete newbie, I didn't know one thing about IoT before engaging in this course. I gave it one star due to actually learning a small something IN SPITE of the fact the prof is extremely inarticulate. The course is extremely short and vague. There was no care in detail or discussion or presentation. There's no forum to ask questions or to even start or engage in a discussion.",1
"i dont know why, but it's so frustrating that i have problem with this course. i can't start every quiz in week 4.",1
"If I could give this course a lower score, I would. It was not helpful at all. I ended up having to take another course so I could actually complete my website.",1
"Not explained well, had to take another statistical inference course. Not worth the money.",1
The quiz do not relate to the lectures....a lot of thinks need to be explore in documents outside of the course and the knowledge of the student has to be higher. Not a course for not engineering background.,1
I was very disappointed because in order for me to move to the next module I have to pay to unlock some of the course materials. Coursera is changing. I understand that in order to maintain such a big structure is expensive; however it wasn't clear to me from the beginning that I have to pay to unlock the 2nd module courses.,1
I'm not able to submit my assignments,1
In compare with first course of this specialization study materials are too few. Some lectures not longer then 2 !!!! minutes. The whole time of lectures 10-15 minutes,1
"The most boring course i have ever done in my life... Soporific course, Content interesting, but professor is just reading slides, with reading mistakes every 2-3 words. I would not recommend this course at all.",1
Outdated,1
She is fluent just like reading the scripts.,1
"Are you a struggling programmer? Someone who doesn't know how to install software via command line? Not experienced with GitHub? If any of those describe you then this is not the course for you. The professors seem to create an environment where if you are too new to anything, then you should take a different course(even though every module has ""introduction to .."" in the title). Does Coursera offer introductory courses to Ruby or Ruby on Rails other than this ""introduction"" course? No.",1
My laptop was not sufficiently fast to run Oracle VM (I'm using Ubuntu) and there where no other instructions for how to install the Oracle dbms,1
Terrible. A waste of time and money. I recommend doing Statistics with R from Duke instead. This one should be taken off coursera.,1
"I'm sorry to say this Course is really boring, poor in resources and I'm sorry to say this but it's the worse Coursera Course I've attended .",1
This is probably one of the worst courses I've taken in Coursera.Just an enumeration of what's on each version of the operative systems and few more information.,1
"I felt that the delivery was not effective. The pacing and tone of the speech was challenging for me to listen to. There were unnatural pauses within sentences, causing the lectures to drag out longer than necessary and it was difficult to connect the thoughts of a sentence together because of the unnatural pauses. The result of this was that it it required an inordinate amount of effort to understand each sentence and to put together the sentences into meaning.",1
too,1
"I´m quite disappointed in this course. First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples. With some changes that course will fly high :)",1
its a fail,1
This was a giant advertisement and got tiresome very quickly.,1
"So far this is the poorest course in DS specialiation. Coins and dices all the time, Brian reads to the camera. It is just like reading a book, a very boring one. Examples from real life could boost interest.",1
High on opinion and low on scholarship.,1
The course lacks of explanation and it's very difficult to follow. It seems that the instructor just reads the slides without reasoning and explanation. Suggested reading materials are needed.,1
"Margaret Meloni was constantly looking down to read directly from a poorly-rehearsed script while trying to stumble through phrasing and lecture points. Considering this is a course about communication, this was very disappointing. The quizzes were vague and either didn't have clear correct answers or didn't feel applicable to the module to which it was assigned. After reviewing the material, I had to complete the quizzes by trial-and-error since the answers were not reflected in the lectures.",1
"I was enrolled in the full specialisation and things went great for the 2 first courses i did, which were mostly peer-review-based (logistics & sourcing).With this one i gave up feeling really unassisted and unable to get answers to my feedback requests. no feedback is provided when you ask something in the forums, ever.When you flag a milestone because of technical issues you won't be ever answered (even when you upload screenshots as proof).The practical exercises with spreadsheets are poorly explained and even contradicted, especially as far as cutting and/or rounding integers are concerned. this is something that can prove 'costly' when doing the quizzes I failed all the questions of all the quizzes for all the attempts I tried. I'm not sure if this is coursera's fault or rutgers' but i don't think i will take ever another course (paying) here in coursera with these kind of calculation quizzes, it's a waste of time.I can't imagine how a mathematical or programming course must be with this poor approach of assessing the results. I suppose I will be censored if I explicitly mention similar sites to coursera but these kind of tests and quizzes are much more better addressed.In a nutshell, I subscribed to the full specialisation paying 45 EUR per month, the first month I was able to certificate myself with the 2 first I did ( logistics & sourcing), this second month (planning & operations) that has just started I gave up, so my final outcome is 2 certificates for 45 EUR each one.Tolerable but you'll never get me here again.",1
No need for videos if all the teacher does is reading his slides.,1
"I'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.I wish I had read course reviews prior to beginning. First assignment was tough... but do-able. Second assignment seems straight forward, but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be FAR BEYOND anything touched on in lectures.I'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scam.",1
This course is a sequence of sales pitches by Hlavac's relations. The continuous invitation to purchase a course where companies advertise their products is a shame and lacks in depth material. Followed the whole course in the hope it would get better but unfortunately got more irritated than educated.,1
"This class presents very elementary information in the video lectures, then it requires knowledge far beyond what is taught in the course to finish the final project.",1
"Errors and glitches in the first two quizes that aren't fixed ('Don't worry, be happy, it's just a formating error, ignore the literal text displayed and just use your imagination to interpret what we thought we meant to say') have left me too unimpressed to spend more time wondering if I need to debug my code or debug their quizes.There are many other resources for learning python out there, and some of them take pedagogy seriously. Not, it seems, this one.",1
"Very boring, not engaging at all. uses the phrase ""you know"" and ""um"" too much",1
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,1
"Very horrible and boring course, poorly designed and the teachers can't even speak properly.",1
Lesson 1 - no longer available via PCLesson 1 no longer exist to do via PC on internet.Sugggested . It has been removed. Cannot go ahead without having the Lesson 1 information.,1
The course could be completed in a matter of a few hours. Super basic stuff. Waste of money.,1
"In my opinion this course does not teach you to 'speak English professionally', but it teaches you to 'learn how to speak English'. I was looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional emails and have professional phone conversations, like which words I should use, what common sentences are or how to build up professional sentences. I am a bit disappointed and think this course was a waste of time for me. This is really meant for people that are learning to speak English and don't know how to pronounce words or how to respond to people in a really easy way.",1
Useful as a necessary step towards finishing the specialization only.,1
Description of assignment questions is not clear. The expected answer from the questions are confusing.,1
"I am afraid this is going to be a rather negative review. Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst. For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time. Put it simply, the presenter can't teach, at least not the MOOCs. There were no structure. The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually ""code"", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller. Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map. I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad. It's really not hard to find better material to learn Ruby/Rails, even just slightly better, even YouTube videos. I am frustrated at myself for putting in the effort (really try) and wasted days. I am leaving this course and unlikely to sign up any MOOC from the same team again.",1
"Course assignment requires knowledge that is not discussed in the course. Various inconsistencies throughout the course. Week 4's material is not really helpful and I had a feeling that the instructior just wanted to ""wrap up"" the course and didn't really care if the material is appropriate. Poorly written quizzes.",1
Two days later and still no available.,1
"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",1
it has to be reviewed,1
It is a little sad that the materials taught were not matching test materials well in the quiz.,1
To lock assignments for money is disgusting.,1
Coursera lost my thoughtful 2-star review so I am replacing it with this. I learned a lot through my own efforts and through the efforts of students who bothered to post in the forums. The one mentor disappeared half-way through the course.,1
Poor English. Unfair assignments ((,1
This is mostly a sales pitch for the professor's book (you're required to purchase the book for the class).,1
"It's not a university standard course. It's more like introduction to introduction DIY Swift. The videos are chaotic and lack explications, examples, exercises and practical assignments. Much better intro to Swift can be found on many youtube channels or just on swift documentation website.",1
Another approach but mathematical demonstration is probably possible.Coursera offer technologies to avoid classroom demos on whiteboard.,1
There were key definitions and concepts that were stated wrong in this course. Please read the student forum for details.,1
Terrible englishQuite diffuse contentNo reading texts,1
"If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt.The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll ""build applications"" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper. However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities. If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of. Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.",1
"No teaching. Just a guy talking. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.",1
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).,1
"This is the second of the series, and I had high hopes for this one after the first one was a disappointment.While the material was on the sparse side, the level of the course was more as advertised. The Matlab assignments were not too difficult, but were relevant enough to the material to be acceptable. Some of the assignment simulations/animations were not working, but I was able to submit the results and get full credit. I was ready to give 2 or 3 stars in this review.Unfortunately, on the last assignment, the sample code and scripts was buggy (even towards the end of the course after it had been pointed out to the staff), and inconsistently written.The final project submit script would not work and it was a trial and error troubleshooting to understand why. Some on the discussion boards were able to submit, but other couldn't. Although my assignment would run as I understand the project should, I could not even submit it. Judging from the discussion boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.Again, the University of Pennsylvania has missed the mark with this class and the robotics series. It is regretful that I must again leave a one star review.I realize this is the first time this course was offered, so there are some issues that need to be worked out. I suggest for the remainder of the classes in the series, the creators should do a pilot run first before releasing to Coursera.",1
"I DON'T recommend this course AT ALL. This college doesn't spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos (less than 10mins in total per a week) and external references (which someone else wrote). The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other. I haven't learn anything from this course. It's just a waste of time and money. Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses/specializations provided by other universities though,",1
"Worst course ever. I stopped partway through. Too many links to outside stuff. Tests/quizes were not based on what was presented in the lessons. Test design is horrible, too many negative questions. Glances over the good true information about nutrition to tell us about free range farms, farmers markets, etc., which most people do not have access to or can not afford.Giving it 1 star is being nicePeople who sponsored it should get their money back.",1
not very dynamic,1
"In fact, this is an inconsistent attempt of re-implementing previous FRP course from the same authors. FRP course had many issues about homework/lectures being poorly related, this one is even worse. This is very frustrating, as a topic itself is one of the most interesting ones in today's software engineering.",1
"The course starts with a short introduction on the topic of usability and user experience. A good idea, but not very well presented.Next is an intro to bootstrap. OK, but not deep enough for a course called ""Responsive Web Design"".The last two weeks cover JavaScript. Or more precisely: they cover a few JavaScript libraries.To sum it up, the course could really use a revision. There are too many mistakes in the examples and sometimes, the instructors look a bit unprepared and confused.",1
Very short not good It doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship,1
"Lost in details. Professionals(btw I hold a MSc degree in Computer Engineering) cannot get anything from this. What is the point of writing frequency.pl where there is a hist() function in R? If the instructor is trying to teach us how to program in any language, then I can assure you the data science class is not the right place. I recommend the instructor check ESSEC Business School for analytics subject to better comprehend the Coursera and its goals.",1
"It's too short, I think it should be a part of a course and not a course itself.It is a repetition of concepts and examples from other courses by john hopkins univ.",1
I found it very hard to understand the lecturers and what they were saying.,1
Really disappointed you have to pay to be able to do the quizzes. I thought the whole point of Coursera is to enhance our skills for free and chose to pay for a certificate if we wanted to.,1
"Unfortunately, this is a poorly designed course. It seems like it is strictly scripted, the instructor looks like she's reading the material. It's very boring to watch. And as a student with a business background, I learned zero things related to PR or research. Everything discussed through this course is nothing beyond definitions and general business knowledge. She keeps hinting on discussing the topics further in different section (Which didn't happen) this leaves me confused on why not discussing its details now?! Discussing SWOT analysis is a strategic concern, and as a PR related course we should see more related to marketing and communication techniques as a result of the search. But guess what? its not there... This course Is not worth the money.",1
"This course seems to have interesting content and presentation, but the quiz concerns the materials not covered in lectures or readings (be it required or supplementary). This is totally confusing.",1
"If you have higher education, and studied derivatives and matrices, this course is a quick review and test of your skills. If you never studied course subjects, you would hardly be able to learn them through this course. I completed it as a part of specialization, that's the only reason.",1
Don`t put your irrelevant politics in games,1
Poor. Very boring and dull presentation. Hardly anything is explained very clearly. It would be far more profitable to simply study an appropriate textbook or online course notes.,1
A simple list of programs that needed to be installed would cover 90% of the course content. Some of this content is also repeated in other courses in the sequence. If you have any technical skills this entire course is extremely tedious.,1
"Very basic for the cost it represents, it doesn't really provide information beyond what one could find on a simple review on the first page of Google.",1
"I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little. The title of this course should have been ""An Introduction to Just a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."" And there are so few philosophers covered. However, the biggest problem was instructorAlasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged. He showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes. It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the ""why"" of everything! A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there.",1
"This was by far the worst course in the series.There is a lot of good content in this course that needs to be shared, but I just felt the delivery failed in a lot of ways.Here are some issues1) Often, concepts are thrown out but aren't explained clearly. Speaker glosses over them without giving concrete examples2) The structure of the course is poorly configured. On several occasions, inline quizzes test you on concepts that haven't been introduced until later in the video, forcing you to guess at answers. Also, the assignment portion of the course asks you to submit a word or pdf with images, but it wasn't configured to allow uploads. You could only submit text in a text box. I realized I wasn't the only person with the issue when I graded assignments from others who had trouble submitting their assignment. In some cases, I believe students failed that portion of the course because they could not figure out how to submit. I have some IT background and was able to share my homework through my shared drive fortunately.3) The speaker should re-record his lecture. It was obvious (or at least seemed as if) he was reading a teleprompter. There were many awkward pauses between sentences that made it hard to listen to. Often times, the audio presentation were inconsistent with the words in the slide, making it confusing because I didn't know which I should be following.",1
Awful teacher and explanation and material,1
I am dropping this course. don't e-mail any more for this course. How do I unroll in this course.,1
"No forum, what are you thinking!",1
"The video lectures are not adequate, too much self-study effort is needed to have a good understanding of the subject. The time allocated for this topic is not enough.",1
"This is a nice effort, and it obvious how hard everyone has worked. There are too many presumptions presented as 'facts', though, and too much certainty about research issues that lots of debate is still going around. So, good work, but unless the course is supposed to attract only ignorants and people that haven't been in contact with 'science', some of the instructors act a bit 'I know it all' and that is how it is, although no-one does yet. Sorry to discover this spirit in here.",1
It's a 2 week course that's not particularly difficult or creative with the assessments.,1
"The videos are fine. But, It's SIMPLY TERRIBLE to force people to pay to be able to do the quizzes. There was no such a thing in the first two courses (by the way, I gave high rates for both). It is OK to pay for the verified certificate, however, disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money, because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate, and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available. This whole Specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guys are in urgent need of money, rather benefiting the community. Remember there are tons of free resources on the internet, and this only undermines your strengths. You will lose tons of potential fans. Stop being seemingly arrogant.",1
"The course, and indeed the whole specialization, was advertised as not requiring the Graphlab Create toolkit. This is untrue, as the final programming assignment does require it. The general dependence on SFrame is understandable since it is open source, but requiring any interaction with a licensed product (even if temporary and research licenses are available) greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course.",1
"Course is overwhelming. How can you put a 30 minute video for a class? Can you divide it or make it simpler? Tutor is not explaning, he only reads; he reads sort of teleprompter and that's it. Boring. Very disappointed. And this is not my first course in Coursera. I feel I'm about to quit, and this is the second week...",1
"Decent course content, but fairly basic. However, the peer graded evaluations are subjective and take too long to get feedback and progress in coursework. I will not be taking another course that uses this loose of a peer evaluation.",1
"Not a class for the beginning programmer. The lectures do not line up with the assignments, and if you don't have programming experience, you could easily spend 10-20 hours/week figuring out how to finish the assignments.",1
"Rather theoretical introduction to the basics of an interesting subject. Regretfully examples and assignments are frequently overly complex in areas which are unrelated to the subject. In addition, people who work with software development should expect to look further if they aim to add to their toolbox.",1
Very hard to understand,1
"Given this is the third (or fourth) iteration of this course, it's telling that the errors from the original release remain in the videos and quizzes. There are other, higher-quality Data Science MOOCs available.",1
The educator is really wants to be boring. The questions doesn't reflect the material. Why am I learning so much about a dog or who is whose relative in a bioelectricity course?,1
Not at all what I expeted,1
"bad useless garbage,this is the most bad online course i've take,just waste time",1
"The course is too boring, I am not sure if it is because of the language or the lectures.",1
Horribly designed and developed. Jack Wu may be an expert but he does not know how to teach others.,1
"This is a good course for deciding if you want to pursue a more advanced degree in Cryptography, Computer Science, or Mathematics, but As part of a Cyber Security specialization, your paying customers are most likely working professional engineers or programmers, interested in practical applications of cryptography that they can use in order to create secure systems and services. This is a mathematics course and your paying customers are not going to use the knowledge from this course in their jobs. This is not an indictment of the instructor, but of the content itself. It is the wrong content for your target customer.",1
"I've done quite a few online courses over the past few years, and I consider this is without doubt the poorest. The lectures do not comprehensively provide the information needed to complete the assignments. I think this is not just my opinion either as posts in the course forum suggest other participants have the same view. The stated module completion times are wildly optimistic. I only managed to complete the course by substantial independent research. Consequently, I would not recommend this course.",1
"I think the intention behind including this course was probably well meaning. I think it was a punishing course to get through for those of us who had no background in statistics, scientific studies, or programming. While I was able to fail my way forward through it, it was completely overwhelming, and overly painful. I really think the expectation should be set before students sign on to the specialization, as was I wonder how many students gave up on the whole Interaction Specialization after this course. Prof. Wobbrock was great, but I think there was a lot of vocabulary assumed to be known to us that just wasn't. I felt like I had been dropped down on Mars.",1
"The distributions were not well explained, it could have been handled in a much better way!",1
"The instructor is VERY bad at presenting. SO dry and monotonic. Omg, I really want to learn all this but can't stand him talking.",1
"*No Stars*Okay.... this class is very pointless. It is super boring and gives me little information. He says that you do not need to buy his book or visit his suggested website, however that is all he talks about.At least the tests are not focused on that, its mostly on vague points he explains. I would not recommend this class.",1
Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,1
"The instructors rushed through the Javascript part. Unlike the previous sections, this section assumes that one knows Java and its syntax beforehand.",1
Very broad instruction but very picky quizzes. Spent more time frustrated with trick questions on quizzes than actually learning something.,1
The theory explained and the exercises are not at the same level.,1
Assignments do not match up well with the lessons and the lessons are BAD. They are not educational.,1
"I do not recommend this course. It did not fill my expectations. I am not able to create application for mobile phone after finishing it.First 4 modules were somehow useful but since module 5 onward it is just waste of time, I did not learn anything useful, I did not learn how to code. Advices for sources were very shallow and it was not shown how to work with them. I could gain same information with basic search engine request.The teacher is nice and willing to give information to students. But unfortunatelly he did not prepare for recordings of videos. His speeches lacked structure and focus. Very often he was lost in talking and he often re-explained (in detail) staff which was already explained in previous videos. This caused that videos were too long considering the amount of knowledge that was provided to students and watching them was waste of time.The course was shallow, information did not go deep. Students participation was not supported (nor required) after 1 module.",1
"More practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge. Concepts seem abstract outside of any programming practice. Additionally, flow of lectures seems scattered at times: concepts are introduced then not expounded upon. This creates a distracted learning path that makes it difficult to follow the lessons. (From a beginner programmer's view).",1
to much math,1
"This course starts off interesting and then just gets absurd. A huge chunk of the genetic part has activities where you have to translate large genetic sequences by hand. If you don't have access to a printer, trying to break up genetic codes into 3-letter codons and translating them is an exercise in frustration. Plus the sequences are not even easily formatted for printing as they are all images so you can't even just copy them into an editor and break up the sequences.This was only the second course I dropped on Cousera.",1
The assignments had nothing to do with the lectures. The teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories. The class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.,1
Too hard to listen his English,1
This course was nothing like true Tibetan Buddhism which is my religion ! please consider canceling it immediatly or having me or a real lama as the teacher,1
The instructor looks nerves when he talking.,1
"The URLs for the course's required readings are presented as non-clickable text in the course lecture videos. There is no list of URLs for the readings available which I could find, and to take this course students are required to copy dozens of long, cumbersome web addresses from the videos.",1
This class was really lacking. The content was skimpy and the assignments overly simple and rote.,1
need to pay to submit quiz.,1
"you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems, or it will be marked wrongthe course is ""as is"" meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content, so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum. get use to this: ""A moderator deleted your post in Calculus One because of spam""""Review our forum Code of Conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions"", but i and others are only posting problem areas, thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post, there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at. real smart. i asked to have my grade adjusted, but they deleted that post also",1
"Course itself is a 4 star, pretty good. The service from Coursera a one star. An assignment was submitted by the deadline but was never reviewed. Course closed and they say I have to enroll in the next course. What a huge pain. Wont take Coursera classes again for certificate.",1
"Very disappointing. Poorly written quizes and presentations. The level of the course is far too basic to be of value, but is required for the specialization. Why not offer an option to test out of basic introduction courses?",1
The teachers have a strong Spanish accent and they fail in what they try to teach: improving.,1
Basically this course was an excellent promotion of PwC as a consultant. A well crafted introduction of buzz-words with very little substance (Unlike the following courses on Excel and presentations),1
"What a lazy excuse of a course. Why would you call it a course? Just call it ""Start Writing"" and put it on a blog. No guidance, no tips, no effort whatsoever. Without any guidelines, how does review from a fellow novice help? It's like blind leading the blind.I'll go with the minimalist style of this course and use just one word to describe it: Rubbish.",1
too slow,1
"I'm giving just a single star. I started this course with high hopes, bailed after the third quiz as I wasn't learning anything except how to pass the quiz. Sorry, but this was a major letdown to myself and two other colleagues who all signed up to take it together. We all bailed.",1
a little boring. I spent lots of time on learning on an useless language rather than learning the spirit of functional programming. I suppose to use C/C++\python or other normal programming language as the lesson language.,1
"The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive. There are many examples in it, but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process.The high level process proposed is good, but it is into the details where the processes fails, and there are no detailed examples here.By far, the worst thing related to this course is the peer review. they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined. I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money.",1
It was too advanced for me,1
We are expected to complete a quiz for which we can submit responses only when we purchase the course. What Bullshit!!,1
"The course started a month late, when it finally started it was boring. I can' believe i paid for the certificate. Despite paying for it i'm not going to bother completing it.",1
"Videos way too short, annoying music/animations, lots of stereotypes (floating 0's and 1's, really?).This doesn't seem like a serious course provided by a university.",1
"since there is a lot of math involved, there should be some carefully written readings. (not only slides or phd thesis)",1
this is terrible,1
"When it comes down to it, there's simply not the support to assist a student that has a really hard problem, ""hacker mentality"" seems to equate to ""figure it out on your own cuz nobody's going to help you"". If things do not work perfectly for you then you are likely never to be able to finish because your ""peers"" don't know any better either. The way this class is set up makes me angry every time I have to deal with it. I would probably be just as well served doing just the swirl() exercises. I would quit if I hadn't paid all the way through in advance. I can't believe this is the type of school John Hopkins is to produce a course of this quality, but I guess I have to.",1
"To be honest, there are no techniques here that cannot be found in many other places. The only difference is that they explain the science behind the techniques, which in terms of practical application is not very useful at all.",1
"too easy, little content, can pass course easily without watching any of the videos",1
Confusing. No help. Poorly presented.,1
"This course is not suitable for beginners at all, everything basic is skipped. Highly not recommended",1
"Videos are poorly narrated and are marginally effective: vocabulary + key concepts only. The ""swirl"" exercises are woefully inadequate to prepare students for the quizzes. Foundational tasks (i.e. establishing a valid connection to the sample data) are conspicuously absent from the guided exercises; leaving too many students to seek help from message boards and google. Lastly, the ""professors"" are completely unreachable: they may as well be dead. After 30 years in the IT industry, I found this course to be profoundly aggravating and a complete waste of my time - I have abandoned this course and bought a ""Teach Yourself"" book instead.",1
Not what expected ...,1
"the course delivery is regrettably boring. The 90-second breaks don't work very well. The lecturer is not trying to be engaging or at least pleasant to listen to. I hope he lectures this way in the attempt of being clear. However, it comes across as being very monotonous and boring. I had a strong motivation to follow the course, but honestly had to drop without completing the second lecture. A missed opportunity.",1
"Too many things I already know and which are quite obvious, when you have some little computer science knowledge, less practical information; the explanations for installing Cloudera etc are insufficient!!!",1
"This review does not reflect the course content. The new Coursera UI makes it impossible to download transcripts or slides of the videos. Without these features, following the lectures is significantly more difficult, and I can't rate this course any higher than 1 star. I would rate it zero stars if that was possible.",1
"Lots of good information, but the presentation is very bad. Not only are the professors clearly struggling with the English (and the material, calling anatomical planes ""plates"" and confounding sulci with fissures, etc), but some of the recording/video editing decisions make it less engaging and more difficult to follow. For example, the size of the images is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen, even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do so.Overall, I do not recommend this course.",1
"If you are planning to learn R, then go and buy a book. This course is a complete scam. At least don't pay any money. The reasons;1.) They advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week. That's a lie, you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little R programming.2.) The quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons. They teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes.3.) The instructor has no idea how to teach. May be he is trying to prove something. I couldn't really understand his motives. If you really want to teach that's simple. You do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes, or tell us to read a certain material. He didn't do any of them which means he either doesn't know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam.4.) And I don't really understand what coursera is doing by the way? What kind of a business model is this. I was planning to enroll many specializations but now I am not going to do it. So think about how much they are loosing. Where is the quality assurance. Just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe them?MY ADVICE TO YOU: DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS SPECIALIZATION. AND FOR ANY OTHER COURSE READ THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST (WHICH WAS MY MISTAKE).",1
I would not recommend this course because the video lessons are quite poor. The teacher mostly reads notes from his iPad without a proper presentation or some kind of text.,1
I have submitted all my solution long back but the last submission which was suppose to been by mentor is pending from one and the half months.,1
not all apps wok on my devices so I was unable to do assignment. Apple Annie was difficult,1
"I would not recommend this course for a few reasons:1. There are no course notes accompanying the video lectures. Transcripts of the lectures in unformatted text files and a glossary are available for download. I really can’t figure why the instructor doesn’t provide an outline of what key concepts he wants us to learn from each lecture. Also, I’m surprised that Coursera doesn't require a basic set of learning tools for a paid class, such as lecture notes or an outline. This might be a good class for you if learn well from videos.2. The quizzes contain ambiguously written questions for no good reason.3. Two weeks in and there is little substance. For example, week 2 includes a few Skype videos of the professor interviewing former students from a Duke Master’s program. They seemed like very intelligent and nice people but the content of the videos offered little value (i.e., nothing new) to someone already working in corporate IT.",1
The course is almost about nothing. It seems to me that the teacher didn't make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse. After 8 weeks of Arduino-related courses I've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters of Arduino Starter Kit book.,1
To lock a quiz for payment is mean.,1
The Final Exam was way too difficult compared with the knowledge provided by the lessons.,1
"I was looking forward to starting this course, but so far, checking through the delivery of the first 4 weeks, I can't see spending time voluntarily following this. There is no doubt a lot of work put into this, but it is painful to take part, so no thanks for me.",1
Unfortunatelly I did not get anything from this course. The course was based on a few obvious tips you get from any self-help or management book.,1
Instructor was boring,1
I cannot complete the course due to installations problem of the software required even if I have all the requirements needed on my laptop.,1
"The class recording could have been made simple. Lots of notations, and would definitely be difficult for people without prior econometrics background.",1
"I think for somebody who has no prior knowledge in this course will find it difficult to understand. I have taken some introductory courses in swift programming and were much more elaborating than this; for instance, the part ""i think"" in week 4 were Jack Wu explains closures, functions, enums, structs... in less than 10min, i studied that in around 5 hours atleast in other visual tutorials online. in the last lecture on image processing, the instructor gave 16minutes tutorial on manipulating image pixels and then gave a link to a website to explain everything about ImageProcessing, a much heavier topic than working with pixels, and even it was not in Swift but Objective-C which i have no knowledge in that language and it wasnt stated in the course that it was a prerequisite.final assignment is quite vague on the requirements needed by the instructor. would have prefered to have more interaction with the instructors on the assignment atleast. Im not the only one complaining about this issue, you can check the discussion in the course. I guess im fortunate that i have already studied those courses from external sources before i started here.one of the instructors speaks quite fast with alot of anxiety making it quite difficult to understand without repeating the video.",1
Repeats the same information over and over,1
"Feels underwritten by the DEA, and aimed at perhaps high school students? Very slow pace; info could've been distilled into less than half the lectures (I completed the '7 weeks' in 3 days). Doesn't really distinguish between users without serious problems & addicts (which I believe amplifies gateway effects & experimentation once people meet users who aren't brain damaged or addicts). Creates an exaggerated and arbitrary distinction between prescribed drugs as all good and recreational as all bad, and dismisses any possible benefits of substances that are not legal, noting only that medical marijuana has been helpful for HIV patients, which is certainly an understatement. Components are also helpful for cancer patients, anxiety, and more. Perhaps break this into studies of common drugs, how they work, & effects and separately, the mechanisms of addiction and treatment. However, I appreciated the 'reduce harm' policy economics.",1
No good without the missing course and capstone projects,1
"This course is actual for Mac machine, all instruction are for Mac only. I use Windows so it unuseful for me.",1
Too theoretical.,1
"The worst course I've ever taken.Bad sound quality, dead discussion forums, not possible to understand material without external (not mentioned in the course) sources.",1
"Advertised as an easy course, week 1 is simple but quickly becomes far too difficult by week 2... Too late for your refund.",1
"As others have said, the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials. However, the capstone project was a waste of time. Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me. In addition, the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1/3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all. This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses. I expected a lot more from a Wharton-led course - very disappointing.",1
"Sadly, I found the presentation poor: not at all fluent, and under-prepared - sometimes what was said was different from what was written (which was correct), potentially causing confusion. Also, some results were given without justifying them, for instance the concept of simplest number was stated but not proper",1
makes it very confusing. I was looking to make a business websites.,1
"Very theoretical, lack of clear structure and arguments, sadly, one of the weakest courses I've seen on Coursera.",1
Very elementary coursework. Quizzes were too simple while I expected some challenging questions that'll make you think. Please improve the assignment quality.,1
"I found this course to be very basic. I appreciate that Marketing requires a broad interaction, but a course designed to take 4 weeks (with 2~3 weeks of actual content) is too much. I need to learn about cost-per-click, impressions, ROI on ad spend - that sort of thing. I don't see how 3D printing is relevant to the majority of people in marketing today.",1
The teachers there do not do what they teach: they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression. I was disappointed.,1
"You really need prior coding experience to understand the training. I also was very disappointed in the teaching. We have an incredible opportunity to improve education, and I feel that this course is merely an extension of current learning techniques. It was extremely difficult for me to fully participate without paying. I was using this course to make a specific android app to control my wheelchair. I act as an analyst for my programmer husband. So I fully understand code architecture, but absolutely hate coding by hand. This course glossed over coding however it is far more code intensive then I was led to believe.",1
"Extremely basic intro, not valuable if you have any understanding of the the space",1
"Horrible. The tests make very little sense, use elements not described in the course and is generally very confusing.",1
Professor is very knowledgable but he is fast... Even before i can understand the first line. he is on the fourth line. i find Hard to keep up with him. I am dropping this course.,1
"Very confusing lectures, he says you don´t have to have a basic level of excel to do the course but I didn´t find that true. Struggled through all of the lecture videos and the quizzes seemed to come out of left field.",1
Bloody coursei am very much angry with this course,1
"Extremely repetitive with little to no visual interest. Needs to be cut down to about one tenth the presentation time. There are no visual representations, no exercises and no interactivity.This is the most repetitive MOOC I have ever taken and I've taken a great many.",1
Bad videos. Reading material should be summarised,1
"Not very well organized course to teach the essential principles of negotiation. The course material moves incongruently between legal and business negotiation tactics, which would make it difficult for any untrained future negotiator to understand the art of negotiation and ADR for business and law.",1
"The lectures are insufficient, the homework instructions are incorrect, the autograder is terrible.",1
"This course is badly structured, with proposed tasks not being well oriented, and videos where teachers are constantly doubting and making mistakes. Not really happy with it.",1
"This course ""talks"" about a really important subject. - that is probably one of its key benefits.I got really passionate and worked hard on the theme, and after completing I felt that It did not gave or matched the expectations on the course name/subject .Benefits:1)Important theme ( within business context) discussed with good videos and references2)Historical perspective on Creativity is sound3)Prof. Shlomo Maital is a warm, highly informed and passionate person about the subject.4)The course in week 2 and 3 makes you think on your one key creativity processesAnd it almost stops there since the purpose of the course gets flawed by the lack of requirements in the peer review, supporting materials and forum ""health"" that is why the course talks does fail in training/ teaching.Key points to not advice this course - at least in the paid version - see until n.51) Lack of support materials2) Support based on the ZIZOZI book to be bought outside of the course cost3)Reading of the ZIZOZI book in the context of the course ( with some answers to the quizzes being in the book and not in the course material)4) Dive into very interesting methods made only superficially ( Da Vinci Method, IDEO pex) with needs to be explained further.5) Complete or near complete lack of requirements for the classification of the peer review, making it very flawed ( see the definition of scalability per example and how to rank it)6) Forum use and reply almost near nullnessI do expect this course to be revised deeply in its execution. ( See per example Agile from Darden to benchmark).",1
The material was way to dry. Could not get interested in this class,1
This course mostly about how to use plotting libraries in R.,1
Poor lectures by one of the instructors makes it hard to listen.,1
"I would not refer anyone to this course. Although the content is well done, the tech piece of the course is sooooooo frustrating. At one point during the course I kept rating and rating my peersʻ assignments and the system would not accept it. I later found out there was some kind of tech issue. There was NO communication from Coursera whatsoever regarding this--no email, nothing to me or the class as a whole. So, we just had to keep checking and submitting ratings to see if it would finally be accepted. I find this bizarre, to say the least. Now, I am in the third course and the SAME thing is happening! I work full time, have a second job, go to school, raise two boys as a single parent and time is of the essence for me! I do not have time to waste! I keep wasting my time with tech issues. That is so disturbing. Somehow or another we should be kept abreast of tech platform problems. This is crazy.",1
"I've just wasted 2 hours going through repetitions of what I'll learn, but not actually learning anything. Why is it called free, if I can't submit answers to quizzes unless I upgrade first!I now have an adverse reaction towards that course that it doesn't really have much content to it, and I'm not the least eager to upgrade. Thank you very much!",1
"The professor teaches by reading the slides and does not even bother to explain the concepts. The course contents might be interesting, but now I'm dropping this course because they are not explaining any concepts but are just giving facts to memorize.",1
Provided nothing of value or relevance to the previous courses. Additionally there was essentially no input from Wharton instructors.,1
Poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming. To shame!,1
TOO MUCH Peer rating too little hard information,1
Not worth it,1
amateurish presentation. and there is some technical issue with the content. the video gets stuck a lot and the problem is not my internet.,1
"Unfortunately, as often happens, what is ""simple"" and basic for one is not that for another. This course presumes a comfortableness with coding that I simply do not possess as a teacher of high school science. Please try and develop a true introductory course that normal, non-programmers can access. Thanks!",1
Very boring. Not many real life advices. Mstly theory,1
"I'm really sorry to give this rating, but I have no choice. The course was horrendously boring, and so far removed from the interesting and interactive work that we had done in the previous sections of the Specialisation. This is such an unfortunate course to have as a requirement to complete the Specialisation, and especially the final hurdle to get into the Capstone. Moreover it was the longest of all the courses. Thus the least interesting and also the longest - makes little sense!As I said, I'm sorry to give this rating, but it needs to be said. The teacher seems like a great guy. And I'm sure he's killing it teaching statistics and R Studio at Uni, but using R studio to such a standard just doesn't seem like the everyday work an HCI designer would do. A statistician or data specialist yes, but a UI designer?Perhaps you could make the course higher level, avoid the indepth R Studio, and make it 3-4 weeks like all of the other courses.",1
Too many mistakes in the math. I dropped after a week,1
Poor content. Clearly filler material for the specialization. :),1
"You should rename it to 90s style history of comunication from Bell to nowdays with useless facts about it.I watched almost all first block but then I understood that I learnt nothing than I tried the IoT block, but it still wordy and superficial. Use more media to show your main ideas, take a class of public speaking and stop shaking a remote all the time you dont even use it.",1
"None of the previous classes will prepare you for this one. This is not really a class, but rather a project on a topic NEVER covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization.",1
"""much better than the data science with R concentration provided also by John Hopkins. This course has concrete examples, and the lecturer doesn't treat his audience like the first-grade kids."" I take this back. The lecturer doesn't know what he's taking about and what he is gonna talk about for at least half of the time.",1
"Unfortunately on the whole I was very disappointed with this class. I took the first two Python courses and found them manageable, but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two. I reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well. Mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments. I think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments. On average I was spending about 10 hours per week just on the syntax for building the programs.A little about my background: I have 20 years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security. I have an undergraduate degree in finance, an MBA, and another master’s degree in Data Analytics. This 5 course program has been described and sold as beginner level, and given my background I should have handily been able to complete it, but that was definitely not the case. Normally I don’t leave feedback unless I feel strongly about something, so I hope you take it seriously. Thanks.",1
"a little bit old, and too many references to others courses",1
Course material is very poor and did not give much support for doing assignments.,1
"A paradox that a course about virtual instruction is the worst course I've done on Coursera. I am on a verge of quitting it. 1. Despite lots of good information, there is no effort to present it in an interesting and engaging way. 2. Virtual educators say that the students should interact with the platform every 3-4 minutes and yet they give you 15 min video to listen to and look at the same picture. 3. No forums available but the notice about forums interrupts all the videos.",1
"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",1
i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class.,1
Pretty basic stuff.,1
"This course is very sparse on details, and just a week of content. The lecturer is not the best at explaining concepts.",1
very boring,1
"The professor has a very biased view of the Islamic world, which is heavily based on his opinion and approach not on the real facts and dominant his",1
"The introduction is nice, but the problem is the homework design. If homework doesn't cover too much of what people learnt in class, it is easy to forget materials in class.",1
"This course is a waste of time and money. I'm an experienced programmer, and I thought this would be a good introduction to Swift; it wasn't. The first two weeks were short, introductory programming lessons. Week 3, ""Advanced Swift,"" consisted of one 12-minute video that barely scratches the surface of three separate topics.Many things that I would consider fundamentals for this type of programming course (classes, for example) were rarely even mentioned, much less taught and demonstrated.If you want to learn Swift, look elsewhere. Don't waste your time and money on this course.",1
"I had great expectations, but the course focuses on really basic stuff. If you have worked with spreadsheets before, it won't help much. If you haven't, it will not teach you how to use it.",1
"Content of the course is great! But if you get stuck in a problem no one responds or guides you. For practice purpose just take the free version, paid version is not worth taking, as you will not get any additional guidance or support to do assignments when stuck.",1
Not worth it for the bucks.Instructor has tried his best to make no sense of the subject.I would be happy for a refund.,1
"The lectures are excellent, but do not take this course if you are not already proficient in a graphing package, whether it's R, python, or something else much more sophisticated than Excel. Otherwise you will be faced with the painfully frustrating task of learning a package while trying to complete an assignment, all with a short deadline.",1
"I am giving 1 star to this MOOC because giving 0 is not an option.The ""savoir relier protocol"" might be efficient when taught face to face in a classroom but as a MOOC it is a massive waste of time and money (I paid for the capstone project and I'm feeling robbed).I learnt absolutely nothing.This MOOC is a major disappointment from a school such as HEC.",1
starting from week2 the way of explaining the materials isnt good,1
too long,1
The videos have very little to do with tests,1
The subject seems so interesting but we need more historical information. It's nice to have a personal point of view but it is difficult to follow the process then.,1
Some questions in the quiz for module 2 are unclear and seem unrelated to the course work.,1
A little be difficult for me.,1
"Overall this course was very shallow and only touched the surface on the matters discussed. The professors refrained to only mention a few cases of how companies dealt with certain matters rather than provide the tools used in order to reach those decisions. Also, the title of this course barely matches the expectation one has about the content",1
"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",1
very pedantic. course teacher just repeats the information on the slides verbatim. an interesting subject is made quite dull. would request more emphasis be put on presentation skills as the course material seems ok for a refresher,1
Didn't learn anything.,1
"Some content is good and informative but there's a big problem with the teacher accent (adding a ""ch"" at the end of half the words) and his diction (hesitating on the other half the words). Also it seems that the course was created in a rush and lacks a lot of polishing(*). Sometimes the course assumes a good level in computer science and then 2 minutes later it explains how to do a decimal to binary conversion! This makes many videos boring but the slides are not provided so you really have to view the videos entirely. I've followed much harder courses with pleasure but here it was torture to finish it. Also most of the course is just definitions of some specific terms and not practical explanations. I agree that defining a few words is important but here it's just too much. *: Some videos are in reverse order, some are stopped in the middle of a sentence, some quizzes are bugged and don't give credit properly and there's nobody to help students...",1
The first three weeks of this course is ok. The last assignment is very poorly structured with uninformative instructions.,1
Only one week. Not much depth.,1
"This course was a loss of time and money. Except from week 3 material, the rest can be found on the internet and should be required by everyone who wants to take that specialization. This course doesn't worth it, it's just to take extra money from anyone who wants to learn about Data Science.",1
Paying for course just to learn how to loop and make if else statements... I don't think this is the best way to learn java!,1
"Professor didn't do a good job on explaining the theory. He moves too fast. This should improve so that student who has less/weak knowledge of Math can pass the quiz. If you are not a Math student, don't take this class. I was hoping to learn about how to program to control the machine/robot but it turns out that this is more focusing on the theory instead. I would recommend to take another course of ML/Big Data from UCI instead.",1
"I am very disapointed about this course. This course is more about how programming, then teaching about programming in python. The lecture is too long and information value is very low. In my opinion, this course is for somebody who never programming, it is not depend in which language. If you wont to know how if, for, functions works, what is variable etc, then this is the right place where to learn this basics.",1
Not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment.,1
"Seemed like the Capstone was rushed and turned into an Investment Management course...I signed up to practice business finance modeling not investment management. The instructors did not present any further information and referred students to third-party resources (ie, Investopedia and Youtube). Many students in the forums voiced their frustration. Disappointing course with little added value, and in my opinion, hurts Wharton's image.Overall, the Wharton Online Business Finance Modeling Specialization is not worth the ~US$550. If I could I would ask for a refund.",1
It was not the best course I did in Coursera. The teacher was distracted and I had some issues in following her. The information was sometimes too basic and other time on much in depth.,1
"The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes, as they are primarily theory and background. The lectures will not, however, aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments. The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures, the textbook, or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment/quiz. There are so many disparate concepts, that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least, demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R. How to properly import the data, create the file, structure the data, and then perform some analysis. These concepts are introduced throughout the course, but never brought together in one complete project.",1
"The entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences. If there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security, then people will find a way around any security mechanisms in place. If something is difficult to use, then people will likely not use it.",1
"This class was extremely disappointing. While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult. The crux of the course is based on lecture videos. Unfortunately, the videos amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video. There are only 4 programming assignments, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code. Later assignments are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them. I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging. That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignments. I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quizzes, and I know that many agree. If you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine. I got nothing out of this course.",1
"One of the worst courses that I have taken in coursera.The videos feel unstructured without preparation and boring.The quizes are subjective. You can pass all of then without watching a single video or lecture.The assignments are interesting but the way of grading them are bad designed and subjective.Sad, I passed this course without trouble but made me stop wanting to get the full specialization.Spartans! Review the course or better close it. Its a shame.",1
"Too long, not enough concrete materials, too much focused on US.",1
"Very frustrating and disappointing experience. The lectures were hard to follow on many levels:1) The enunciation was unclear and subtitles were often of-the-point, plus they covered-up the code lines that were being discussed.2) The lecturer often failed to explain logical constructs that were being used, despite the fact that the course should have been understandable with no R cran/Bioconductor experience.3) The method arguments were either not explained, or very vaguely mentioned, which means applying them to new situations was unnecessarily complicated.4) No feedback at all was offered from course organisers/reps to anyone, even after complains in discussion forum about quiz questions.5) No feedback for solving the questions/correct answers even after the deadline.6) Quiz questions required methods and logical constructs that were not explained/used/mentioned in the lectures. One quiz lacked background information of what data needed to be used (the info was available in the previous version of the course). Some quiz questions were biologically inaccurate i.e. confusing genes/transcripts/exons.",1
Very limited content. Not possible to complete the projects at the end. -(,1
"I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistic. Or first Basic Statistic than R.I really enjoy the class. but the extra is a bit heavy for me.",1
"Difficult to understand, not a good explainer.",1
"A University Course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a ""limited and reasonable"" amount of time spent in the course. The role of instructors should be to ""invest"" the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to ""learn"" faster than if they had to research (the planet) by themselves to find the knowledge. The information provided by instructors therefore must be ""accurate and complete"". This course has so many ""incomplete"" pieces of information, that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to ""find"" the concepts required to apply the knowledge, hence it becomes a gigantic ""time waster"". Unfortunate! the tool and the concept of data science is necessary, but a course organized this way is only for ""full time students"" that have only one obligation, study. This course as it is should not be in Coursera.",1
"This was advertised as a six week course, but the deadlines make it a two week course. The assignments are exceptionally challenging given that the instructors offer now actual instruction on how to perform them. Two and a half days into the course not a single moderator has answered a question in the forums and I can't find a way to contact Coursera about this problem.I am very disappointed. I was planning on taking additional courses through the Coursera platform, but now I am reconsidering.",1
"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin. We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication. This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation.",1
the instructor keeps repeating the same information throughout all the lectures. It is not as impactful as I thought it would be. The last straw was her saying that-that was an article.,1
This course need a serious rework.For the moment I finished it biggest problem was very unclear grading of programming assignments and lack of learning materials.,1
Outdated course that needs a lot of changes to your code and in releases so you can follow professors code.A lot of people had same issues.,1
"I don't want to be mean, but the first week was terrible! I was expecting what it said: ADVANCED neurobiology.I feel bad giving this review. I'm just dropping the course.",1
Useless bla-bla-bla in general words. Nothing concrete. It is not possible to build embedded system with OS after finishing it. IoT is mentioned just for marketing and promotion. If you seriously consider developing OS-based embedded system even just reading Wiki pages about EOS would not be such a waste of time as listening to this course.,1
Week 2 is an unreasonably difficult jump from Week 1. This course's beginner friendly lectures do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignments.,1
I quit this course as it does not live up to the specialization which it begins. JavaScript is not Java. The course description should clearly state that JavaScript will be taught and that it will be used to draw boxes of different colors. I was extremely let down by this course.,1
TOO SUPERFICIAL,1
"Not for beginners unless you are willing to invest a significant amount of time with outside sources, beyond what is stated as needed to complete the course. disappointing.",1
"There is very little insight in this course. The instructor's slides are very poorly-done, relying on graphs that aren't appropriate for the data being presented and without labeling the axises. There is no engagement in the course forums. The quizzes are trivial to pass.",1
"An absolutely dreadful course. The only things you'll end up studying are how to use the spreadsheets given and what the instructor was thinking when creating them... I can't figure out what, and there doesn't seem to be any way of finding out. The lectures were mostly stuff I learned at school and really quite easy, but I just have no idea what the final project has got to do with the lectures.",1
Quizes were poorly worded.,1
I've taken this course for a while but prefered to stop as I found it very not academic in terms of ethics and objectivity. It spreads anxiety and takes too much liberty with History.,1
In the course info this is described as the first course in the series and that it requires no prior knowledge but the first week quiz contains questions referring to an equation 'discussed in the previous course'.,1
"Extremely poor quality of instruction. The lectures themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slides by an individual with a poor grasp on the English language. The majority of the slides are walls of unclear and non-descriptive text. Even with reading directly from the slides, the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanations if not just outright tangential. I commend the authors for putting together a course outside of their native language but, in this case at least, it does more harm than good.In short, this course has the air of a group of first year students giving a presentation verbatim from the slides, as another commenter also mentioned below.",1
"Really poor powerpoint presentations and videos, half in chinese. The accent of the teacher is horrible (i'm not an english-native speaking person so it's hard for me to follow english when badly spoken, so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitles.)The content is interesting though.",1
"pure information, a lot of ""w",1
"I think this course has very interesting information but it needs a way better format. It needs agile presentations, better, infographics, graphics and design and to be much more flexible and fun.I have not finished it but it does not make me get involved in the content even it is very interesting.It needs a better script and handling of the information to be able to conect with new students.",1
"nothing special, I do understand this are fundamentals, but i felt like 5 year old",1
The contents of PPTs are just read out in the video lectures. It's as good as providing only the PPTs.,1
"This course was ultimately frustrating to take. There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments. Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses).To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors.The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle. Even from the early week's lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors. For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying ""we covered this already."" I'm well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person. I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me ""your logic is wrong"", and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now. Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors. Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again. Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.",1
"This course is garbage. The instruction videos are fine, but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times, and there are certain key points needed to complete them that aren't covered in the videos. The mentor in the forums is lousy, and his responses are worded as if he's talking with a peer and not a beginner/student.I may or may not try another coursera course after this. But if this experience is any indication, Coursera isn't very good. The same UofM course appears over on Udemy, and I wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works.",1
It's really not good this course told us a very basic things never give us deep detail and in most of course it shows us the code and you should write like this but there is no deep understand what is it,1
"Basically impossible to complete quizzes and course project using the provided course material. Poor correlation between instruction and testing. Makes one wonder: If I need to solicit others' guidance to complete your tests, why am I paying for your guidance in the first place?",1
Not worth the price. Extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just to be able to charge for it.,1
"I advice NOT to take this course.Why: the professor is never there to read your assignments. He leaves that totally to other students like yourself, to grade your written assignments, and, they do not read and give you a RANDOM grade in 2 seconds.Don't take it, you will waste sooo much time on this one.",1
This course should retrieved from Coursera. It is plenty of mistakes. One of the quiz is repeated. Questions do not have relation with lectures.,1
"I'm actually REALLY INTERESTED on this course, but Erica's accent is TERRIBLE. It's so hard to understand and focus on what she's saying. Had to quit the course because of that.",1
"Peer review assignments are too hand-held, making the assignments themselves worthless.",1
"I have enrolled in this twice but can't see the course content. Every time I click ""go to course"" I get directed to the description of the course. Where are the lecture videos and other course content?",1
"Very poor quality...The ""teacher"" is talking and talking without saying anything concrete or giving some tools or practical suggestions.",1
"The free version of the course is far more restricted than other courses I've taken, the content wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't really more advanced than other tutorials with far better presenters which can be found online for free",1
"The instructors may be knowledgeable, but they had no knack for teaching.",1
"This course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week. Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant.Secondly, practical assignments are very poorly planned:1) in weeks 3 peer graded assignment students are asked to save Tableau workbooks as twbx files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableau Public that is used in this course. The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau.2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.Overall, this course is just a waste of time. For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableau from the 4 minute long ""Getting started"" video on the Tableau website than from this course. Just wonder how Coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform.",1
"This was more objective than I thought. Nevertheless, the information about the Zionism, refute itself and make us criticize about the dangerous notion.",1
did not like the course at all. That is why I decided to discontinue the course.,1
This course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave.,2
"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.",2
"I didn't really care about the stories from the students or seeing the space for one whole lecture video. It's clear that Ultimaker is the sponsor, but it felt like a commercial. I want to learn more.",2
"weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me. the video lectures were difficult to comprehend. week 4 was very good.",2
The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.,2
"Course was not easy to grasp, lost interest after the first week and I barely got through the quiz at the end.",2
Too far from subject,2
"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.",2
Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion! Quiz questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course. The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analytic course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!! Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.,2
"Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration. Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures.",2
the introduction to Fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced CAD user than a tutorial for newbies.,2
So far the course is just a tutorial for using Scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.,2
"The male Professors seem to speak Chinese half the time, therefore not being able to understand the material for students who aren't fluent in Chinese. I prefer the female Professor from Advanced Neurobiology I who presented the material in English, and in an engaging and coherent way.",2
"The course content is great, but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random. This specialisation needs to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert, not peers.",2
"while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task, the structure of the material presented was not optimal. This in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module. The ""why"" and ""how"" of most modules fit to the meaning we are forming (up to week 5 -the point I am leaving this class) is not evident. Last, some of the questions contained ambiguities that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment. Thank you for the offered class in any case.",2
"It helps you build your essay-writing muscles gradually. Too much emphasis on plagiarism. Some flaws in the grading forms. The level of the participants is quite mixed, most feedback they give is useless (""good"").",2
"It is not very ""advanced""",2
The professor is reading long texts. It is not really attractive.,2
"I greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while I do not doubt the proficiency of it's creators the poor standard of spoken English of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues. As another reviewer has remarked, their English may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time. The transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes. I believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected.",2
Boring and can't make sense of the presentation / language and idiom use.,2
"While some of the information presented was interesting, it seemed oddly biased towards the perspective of highly educated foreigners. I had hoped to get more information about how America is seen by the (foreign) masses.",2
A lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers,2
i like it but there is ALOT to do i am 13 taking this for science class and i am starting to get lost in what the are saying,2
"The professor certainly knows a lot about this subject, but his delivery is stiff and dry. If he shared his passion for the subject with us it would be more enjoyable. On the plus side, I admire how he shares the Greek language with us so capably and combines art with his lectures.",2
Far too easy,2
The teaching quality is very average and mediocre at best.The assignments are merely implementation of lectures .The Stanford and Princeton courses on Algorithms are better courses to take for one to pursue a serious study of Algorithms.,2
"The course is too shallow - amount of topics discusses is quite small. Practice tasks are boring - implement pseudocode given in lectures. No quizzes. In particular you can see that it is a bad course, if you compare it to the previous 2 courses in the specialization. I'm agree with other people posting in forums about that.Wasted time, could spend that month more productively. Not going to continue passing other future courses.",2
"I can only give this two stars at most.The lecturers are just like reading the PPT without any heuristic teaching approaches.The assignments make me desperate, always show very poor feedback message -- ""Wrong answer"", even the cases failed because of performance issue.The starter files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the pdf description. It's so confusing.Couldn't get any help from forums.",2
Course was to easy and nothing new in it not as the description that it has algorithms 100000 times faster than google.,2
"Interesting material, but its presentation is haphazard and incomprehensible. In typical Latin American style, the presenter wanders erratically through the material in the videos in a confusing and non-linear way, so that making coherent notes is impossible. The relationship between the video, quiz and supplemental reading is sometimes hard to determine. The workload is also vastly different from week to week, including one reading of over 200 pages, indeed a whole book - whilst other lectures demanded only a few pages' worth. Sadly this course was one I abandoned - I lost patience with its random and frustrating structure and the limiting and perplexing nature of the quizzes. I should point out I am bilingual so this was by no means a language issue. If you have the patience for this, or are used to this style of learning, go ahead. I've had to stop, sadly.",2
Easy and pointless.,2
Basic introduction to data analytics,2
Can be packed into a two-week course.,2
Authors are too greedy for the course material.,2
"I do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates. Half of this course should have been condensed or excluded. There is not much to learn in these modules. It was decent, but it was not a five star course. I think the ratings on this are misleading.",2
Found it boring and pretty irrelevant. I was hoping to lean more on metrics especially in the digital marketing section. Pretty let down and $79 waste,2
"Everything was either super basic or else more advanced but so niche that it doesn't really apply to everyone and we don't need to learn it in that depth. Would have liked to learn a lot more about how to determine what KPIs you should be measuring in different businesses, what kinds of metrics are important, etc. The very large majority of this course will never be applicable to me.",2
Very very entry level information.,2
I really did not like the portion that went into detail about business analytics and related career paths. Not a technical skill or ne,2
"Poor performance of Jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitments really sunk this one for me. The latter, especially is inexcusable. The syllabus is lopsided and, while organized, not enough thought has been given to the exercise workload.",2
"Errors in the material made it difficult to get through. All past discussions on the forum are gone, making it difficult to review posts by classmates.",2
"Quite boring, a lot of propaganda against drugs. Sometimes data is presented in misleading ways to make the harm from drugs look greater. Though if you are new to the topic, you may consider to take the course as it contains some useful information.",2
"Information strays between ridiculously shallow and unnecessarily deep (e.g. the stuff about GPCRs is so far removed from importance when discussing addiction). Most of the time the questions are poorly worded and thoughtless, and the whole thing reminds me of a bad high school class. Some parts border on misinformation, does seem almost as if it's been underwritten by the DEA. Paints a very distinct picture, a picture with an agenda and really incomplete portrayal of addiction. Points for trying though.",2
"I am very interested in this topic however I found the instructor's presentation to be so monotonic and slow paced that I dropped out. I am sure he knows his material cold and I am sure that he is much better ""live"" in class. The readings were appropriate and the course out line solid. However this is not his media. And I have done the ""talking to the camera"" thing and it can be deadly for presenters. It is not BTW an ""age thing""; I am older than he, I am sure, and do not ask that presentations be entertaining - just that they be engaging. (Perhaps if Coursera had lecturers present in front of small groups, as ""Great Courses"" does? It is unfortunate that (as I understand it) Coursera doesn't offer a ""free look"" with the option to transfer one's fee to another course if unhappy. Hope this is constructive for both the lecturer and Coursera.",2
"As a career dieter who is constantly reading about causes of obesity, I can't say I learned anything too earth-shattering. However, the research discussed does support what I have learned from listening to the podcasts from the Institute for the Psychology of Eating.",2
"Not very informative, and too simple. Also, there is way too much repeating",2
Very informative but very dry presentations.,2
"There's a lot of great information in this course and it's presented in a very good way. However, like the excel course in this specialization, most of the material isn't about using Tableau. 1 week is about running a project, 2 weeks are about using Tableau, and the final 2 weeks are about presentation. If you're interest isn't mainly in Tableau, I would recommend the course. However, if you're taking this course to learn Tableau, I would suggest not paying for it.",2
"This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself. In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job. For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you don't even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)? BEWARE: get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life. Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance. The problem is: some of your audience will know and will notice, more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiot.Sorry to be negative here, but I think I owe you, my co-student, at least a warning: do learn more stats elsewhere!! ... good luck.",2
the course is a bit outdated and I am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses. The topics I think are still relevant but the tools are not. I am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and I did not find this here.,2
A basic course but not for the ones who don't know anything about java or android. Not made for the beginners. Also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easier.Not recommended for the starter.,2
I found this course lacking in providing sufficient coverage of the basics in the course videos and lacking a useful and directed reading list. I spent far too much time researching command syntax and using try and error to find what worked with the provided code.Disappointing as topics covered are good.,2
Yet another good course that is ruined by a peer review requirement. Dr. Singer is a fascinating person to learn from and I am glad I took the time to pursue the course.,2
"Mini-project grades system is awful. btw, you have to wait till three students review you project. One more point is that, the contents of videos are not that enough. You can just read the required textbook to get all knowledge and examples.",2
boring assaignments,2
it is good thing to learn,2
"Many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated. If a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, ""That is not the right answer"".",2
"I wanted to like this course, but (and perhaps it's a mathematician thing) the teacher just kept doing stuff without explaining WHY he is doing the stuff. He is very animated and a good presenter but, even when I understood what he was saying, I couldn't get past the ""why is he doing this?"" It is never ""self-evident"" for me.",2
"This course was too messy. I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work. It would have been better if after each module all the .js and .html files would be given in total, not just the snippets.",2
"Good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve, the instructors are almost NEVER available to assist.",2
"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like ""take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day"". Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to ""write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12"", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the ""lecture-first"" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).",2
Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...,2
I like the professor...but the activities and projects always had errors and issues that weren't easily fixable. And the mentors are absolutely terrible at providing guidance. So I most likely won't be able to finish this course.,2
Learning materials are poorly delivered. Codes given are bug-ridden this in turn makes it incredibly difficult to follow on. Disappointing,2
There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,2
There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. What a waste of time .,2
"Extremely poor help and feedback.Almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved. Considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling.Seemingly outdated lessons.A lot of errors I get come from version discrepancies. Lessons should be checked over. If I have to Google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared.This is enough to make me abort this specialization.",2
This course needs an easier way to peer review. Downloading individual files to computer and plugging into your project without overwriting your own work is a nuisance. Especially during assignment 4 where everything needed to be hosted in the server in order to work; this made is extremely difficult to review.,2
Cannot believe charge me homework,2
"Angular JS is a crucial component of all of the internet. Hardly a website exists without it and it's clear that Angular will go places. However, this course fails on a few crucial levels. As such, my review might look scathing and I'll detail why in a minute, but I want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development. Besides, the fixes that would need to be made on the instructor's side are minor, but when working without those fixes, things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quickly.There are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students, scripts sometimes don't work, explanations are sub-par when explaining things such as $scope. There are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as Task Runners. Sometimes, doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students, it still doesn't work. Some exercises are an hour long for something that won't be quizzed in the end.Understanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent, I still did learn a lot of valuable things and I would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development. However, be prepared to question your own sanity, your skills, the software you use, software in general and just despair at times. All in all, it is a price worth paying for the amazing knowledge you gain.",2
"Angular 1 not Angular 2 which is disappointing but worse still, it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves.Could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as ""Controller As"" syntax and teaching you to write code that is more ""compatible"" with Angular 2",2
"Update:Coursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way: You have to PAY for the course IN FULL AMOUNT JUST to get your assignments submitted and reviewed by peer learner.What a pity.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great course! Material is very useful and interesting!The course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood. Practise quiz and assignments perfectly reflects course materials.Also, professor Muppala is quite funny. Enjoy the course!",2
"Was very difficult to follow. This is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best, but there are times the explanation is not sufficient. Instructions for installing gulp was not good. I was unable to complete the following exercises after gulp installation failed. Instruction needs to be short and crisp. Building on top of each other project has its negative. There must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project.",2
The paste of the lectures is too slow. Much too slow,2
"Interesting content, but sooo slow. 20 minutes long videos could have been done in 5 minutes. Moreover, the teacher's voice and tone did nothing to make the content live.",2
"This course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner, but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than applied.Lectures are very abstract --with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution--, there are few examples with step-by-step tracing of algorithms --that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem--, and a significant amount of expertise is assumed --so much so, that you wouldn't need this course. For example, there are questions about ""approximation ratio"", but it is not explained. This seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms, but is only asked in the exams/project, and is not even mentioned in the lectures. Similar issues abound around the course.",2
"This course covers challenging technical topics and I appreciate that the effort that went into making it. That said I have serious concerns about the quality of execution for Part II of the course, which was much inferior to part I of the course.In general, the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part I and are well done. In many cases, the practice quizzes were less helpful. Including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors, especially an error in the first quiz.For the peer graded assignments, there was one answer field for multiple questions, rather than one per question. Worse, the answers often required equations and LaTex math was not available. The only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like Google Drive and paste a link in. Finally, for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response. Furthermore, doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored. (Part 1 was similar, but it was possible to upload the document to Coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course, resulting in a grade.) Either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the Coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement this.Finally, in the session I took their was no active Teaching Assistance presence. There were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments. Either the course should not have been offered if no TA support was available or there should have been some notification in syllabus that this session would only have peer assistance with no support from the course staff.",2
Dijkstra and A star algorithms courses are a bit short,2
"The course is really way to easy. It could be done all in one day, definitely not worth 80$.",2
"Interesting things about graph algos, but I think the content should be more challengingEspecially the last two weeks, a quick quizz and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content",2
"Not a bad introduction, but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book.",2
Too simple and lack of practice exercises!,2
"This course barely touches C programming. While explanatory about the Arduino functions and structure, It should have been spread into more weeks so that it could cover more.",2
"The contents of the course are interesting however it is a shame that you can only access the quiz portion and assesments if you pay for the certificate. Same with the materials, it would be great if the readings and the suggested bibliography details could be downloaded.",2
I have not been satisfied with the theoretical content,2
"Lacking in content. The OOP portion of the final project was poorly constructed. The instructions were unclear and the exercise seemed futile. We took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object classes. I think a better example could be used. Since there are already plenty of ways to do the things our objects were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise. I think a different type of real world object should be used, perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame.",2
"This courses touches many interesing aspects about R programming but I did not like the structure , it does not seem to me that it adequates its difficulty coming from ""The R programming enviornment"".Also I miss some swirl lessons for many of the readings from the book. There are not too many help from the mentors and the peer assigment in week 4 took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resources. Readings in general are OK but too simple.I have learnt many things but",2
Not quite the excel actually relevant to industrial requirements. had to leave the course mid way.There are better Excel DA courses out there. Concept presentation was good though.,2
"The course was a bit disappointing. We didn't cover enough advanced Excel functionalities, opting instead to focus on 2 statistical models (Binary Classification and Linear Regression). Having a BSc in Economics, the Linear Regression tutorials and quizzes seemed infantile, while the Binary Classification tutorials proved to be too vague, when we actually had to apply this knowledge on the final project. In retrospect, I regret not starting to work on the final week's material right from the start, which resulted in having to switch session multiple times in order to finish the course. Even if I had done so, though, it wouldn't have made up for the vague instructions in the quizzes and assignment of the final week that made feel at a loss, until I asked for help in the forums. All in all, this course need some serious re-working, in terms of how the material is presented and how the assignments are phrased.",2
"Final project almost impossible to do with material taught. Also, each lecture comes with an additional spreadsheet that needs to be studied. Material taught doesn't match material tested.",2
All theory. Quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them. Final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quizzes. Its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lectures.,2
"Course did not meet any of the expectations. Neither Excel nor the analysis part. Should have focused on one of the aspects to make it more stronger. In my opinion ""deviated"" & stressed too much on statistics and model building (regression, logistic regression etc.) but did not do justice to that also!",2
"I'm here learning Excel skills, but this course, especially week 2, does not teach Excel skills.",2
"It is best to have a strong statistical background before taking this course. Lots of statistical calculations and procedures. If you don't have a strong background in statistics , there is a good chance you will get lost at some point in the course. There is no questions that the instructor of this course is an accomplished mathematician, I just found it hard to follow his lectures as he got deeper into various statistical aspects of the course.",2
"Very little to do with Excel, mostly focused on statistics with brief overviews of how things could be done within Excel, but very little focus on actual Excel use and knowledge.",2
"This course is only supported by a course of data analytics. It should clearly state that advanced statistics is a prerequisite knowledge. I expected to learn advanced excel techniques, not to be required to know statistic models to apply.",2
"I did learn a few helpful tips for analyzing data with excel - particularly how to do a regression analysis in excel which is something I didn't know and is not intuitive. But for a course that is supposed to teach you how to analyze data in excel, there are actually very few lectures that actually show you how to do anything in excel. So much time is spent on how to calculate stuff by hand, without even mentioning how it translates to excel. Also the lectures have a lot of errors that were not corrected in a professional way. Just a random slide put in as an afterthought. The lectures got a bit disorganized towards the end, like the professor was in a rush and then forgot to relate everything to actual business analysis. The final project was especially difficult as not much was explained - I had to read the forums to figure out what I was actually supposed to do.",2
"This course was tough, but I dont mind a challenge. But what I found frustrating about this course was that first the quizzes were often inconsistent with the lecture material, the TA's were less helpful than my fellow classmates (without whom I would not have made it through the course) and the final was an IMMENSE challenge that took over my life for about 1 week - despite the calculation by the instructors that it would take 6-8 hours. I did give it a few stars because I honestly did learn things I did not know, and I understand the value of the application of what was taught for modern businesses. I have been informed that the course is being reviewed by the instructors for strengthening and I 100% agree with that direction.",2
"Beware this course, especially if you are new to this area (despite what the course/specialization says). There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course, but what's worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos; the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos, so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments/projects satisfactorily or smoothly.I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn't paid for this specialization. Beware.",2
"The title is misleading .This course has a little to do with excel , you could get some mathematical information but I do not think you will master anything",2
"PROS:- Classification lecture is good;-Weekly assignments are challenging enoughCONS- No slides provided. Professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework. For me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness- Some excel sheets are provided. But they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos. AND, the instructions are for MAC! No instructions for PC are provided whatsoever. I never used MAC, so I had a very hard time!- Very few examples real examples are provided;- You learn math concepts, not Excel skills! Except for the LINEST function, which is very handy, BUT it's NOT TAUGHT in the videos. I had to google the function to learn it.- They say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece. But they only say that as you start week 6!- The course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment. You get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;- Some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!OVERALL:I'd never recommend this course to anyone. I only took it because I'm plannening to finish the specialization.I've taken several Online Courses (5+ on Excel), and this is the worst and most frustating one by far!",2
"Constants errors in explanations, made you work very hard to complete it. We typically work hard, the organization of this course my you to suffer. You will go to learn a lot like I do. (Final Grade 91.4%). Learn in this course can be frustrating, they will push to the water, you will need to dedicate a lot of time discuss course material with fellow learners, mentors, and instructors to learn how to swim to save your life.",2
Too difficult. The lessons go too fast.,2
I found Week 2: Binary Classification really confusing. It was just not clear. Specifics were not given. Definitions were not given. Poorly instructed.,2
I found much of this material wasn't as applicable to excel analysis as hoped and didn't cover many of the analysis tools,2
This class required far too much independent study. The instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week. There was too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material.,2
"I am sorry to say this, but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious way.I do not know how much time the Professors have put on preparation. But it gives me a ""sloppy"" impression!!! The class carries the name of University of Duke and 70 euros are charged, so I think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure, in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited time!For example, I believe nobody would not say that the Week 2 content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained. And this is just one example.",2
Week 1 a little disapointing,2
This course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistics. This is not for beginners and should therefore by reclassified as intermediate and above. I am sorry I enrolled in this course. I have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further...,2
This course contains too few solid content.,2
This is definitely not a course for beginners .,2
Does not teach Excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems. The ability to interface with Excel after some knowledge of Python/R or other programming languages would be helpful in the Data Science programming that is increasingly being promoted.,2
"While the first week touched on Excel and the equations can be used in Excel and have efficacy in regards to analyzing data, it feels as if the course emphasizes more on utilizing math than utilizing Excel. And according to my understanding, that was what I thought I was signing up for. So, it felt like a bait-and-switch to me.",2
To course got tougher every week while the lecture video is not cover everything.,2
"In light of R or Python, doing statistical computing in excel is really time consuming and backward. The instruction might be OK, but I lost interest beginning of week 2 seeing how he build binary decision model in excel.",2
"I found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics. Its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair, but the progression is very rapid.As I work long hours and other commitments I didn't have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course. If I had been able to study an extra 10 hours a week practicing using the formulas then I'm sure I would have got more out of it.",2
"The content of the course was good.However, I did not like the presentation of the material, moreover such a topic would need to be covered by a longer duration course.",2
"I expected far more handy real life Excel examples, not to see a teacher speaking and writing stat formulas for hours.The idea of this course is very good, it has some room for improvement.",2
I feel that the course does cover adequate topic to improve our mastery of data analysis in Excel. The course is more focus on the statistic and probability theory without giving adequate explanation on how to work on Excel.,2
"The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking. You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand. Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project, in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project. The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning. Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences.",2
"Very confusing stuff, need better clarification in course description and the way the material is transmitted to the student need to be reconsideredBut very well made and interesting.",2
This course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected!,2
"I would have liked the class to be less theoretical, with more frequent explanations linking concepts to practical applications in daily / business life, in order to keep interest and motivation high and facilitate understanding and memorisation. It sure would help to enter this course with a certain background of probability. Those memories were too ancient in my case :-(",2
Content not discussed in proper detail. Instructor skims over the concepts. Its difficult to follow.,2
"The content is really interesting and useful. However, the way in which the lessons are organised I'd say is confusing. The professor explain you complex concepts like entropy or binary classification to continue with an excel worksheet. It's here where the issue relays, the excel files are filled and instead of learning by doing you have to figure out how the prof made the file. In consequence, the solution is always available.In my opinion, it'd be better if a raw data set is given and you build the model step by step from the scratch.",2
Videos fine. Quizes impossible to understand unless you take previous courses and have time to go through forums and more extra staff. It takes a lot of time. Not suggested unless you have it.,2
"Much work needs to be done on this course to make it friendly to learners. The quizzes and assignments do not align with what is taught in the lessons. Further, the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learning.I spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what I was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on Google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course.",2
"The material is sort of interesting but there is not much hand-holding. I actually am an Excel beginner, and have merely an average grasp of mathematics. Before signing up, I read the prerequisites - there were none! It is advertised as a class for beginners, but I have found it beyond frustrating, and whats more I pre-paid for the specialization so this Excel class and the final project seem to be an utter waste of money without me going off to study Excel at length before trying the course again. Why not label it as an intermediate or higher class? I feel there should be a more obvious indication of the difficulty.",2
"Too much material, that moved too fast. Wasn't opportunity for enough feedback and explanation. I say this as someone who went to Duke and has taken similar classes at Duke!",2
"It has a lot of problems, including: Not so many lectures about excel itself - most of the time you will be watching videos about statistic methods. The lectures are very superficial, even though the quizzes and projects demand a lot of knowledge and time. The course seems to have a staff of one man: the professor of the course rarely replies (even though he did at the beginning of the session) and all the work seems to be done by his assistant, who tries his best, but ends up not coping with all the questions asked at the discussion forums.",2
"Great idea. Unfortunately, the course is young and there were too many bugs to get past Week 2. Hopefully these will be finished my next session",2
Way too many abstract concepts that are not relevant to the challenges that I encounter in my day-to-day role. I wish this course would actually show me how to solve PRACTICAL business problems.The 2nd part of the course is not enjoyable at all. Sorry.,2
"So many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived. I'm having a hard time seeing the relevance. Also, I learned a lot of these statistics in college and the explanations provided in these lessons actually confused me about things I already know. Very disappointed in this course. Especially since part 1 of the specialization was so good.",2
"The course name is very misleading. While overall it is not a bad course, I believe a lot of people come here expecting very different material. Let's just put it this way: Mastering Data Analysis (mostly things to do with probability) with occasional use of Excel. Do not expect to learn anything new in excel.",2
"The transition is from easy to advanced. It gets really confusing, not sure if it's just me. I am not following the lessons anymore so I left the course.",2
The material could be exciting but the presentation is dull. The pass mark on the quizzes is around 80%. As these courses are supposed to be for interest why do you need 80% to pass?,2
The pronunciation of the lector was more than awful! His English is quite unsuitable for video lectures! It was just a torture listening to him!,2
The content might be great but the teachers don't seem to enjoy presenting the course at all. They are basically reading from a script. Very monotonous atmosphere.,2
"interesting content but not well presented. faculty read the script and struggled with pronunciation, fluency and generally engaging presentation. Combination of basic content on the one hand and highly specialised information / terminology without explanation on the other was not helpful to learning.",2
It's seemingly a great course for K-12 teachers but lacks relevance for higher education.,2
"Some of the content are repetitive. The first interview sounds ""staged"". Some Korean reference (""noon sei"" or something like that ) are non-value adding.",2
"This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic, but doesn't go into much depth. While it's clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material, I still would not recommend this course. Both the presentation itself and the in-video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious. The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to, and the in-video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time. Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities, which are badly designed and just frustrating. Overall, I recommend waiting for a better course.",2
"The class isn't over but I'm suffering through it, not enjoying it, like I did the dino Uof A classes. Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE. He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting. Can't you get the dino guy? Or me -I'll do it for free. PAINFUL. Also - you need more graphics. Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension. Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing. Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the ""sun at an angle around the sun"" graphic but who cares? It's something. And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship?? The content is probably better than my perception - and I'm perceiving high! - because I need an aspirin after 20 minutes of Mr. Please Get A Professional Presenter [or at least competent.] I create online education that is nothing better than Powerpoint and a talking head, lack of budget, but at least the head doesn't make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier.",2
"Interesting subject, the presenter is hard to listen to though.",2
"The course is good but it could be improved. For example, I don't think the images on the background (even if they are stunning) are particularly important and I think they could be substituted by plots and schemes referring to the topics (all the presented schemes where helpful, but there would have been more things that would have been good to see visually).",2
"I've only gotten started, but there seems some assumptions made about how much we know and how quickly we can pick up these new terms and ideas.",2
"Not very helpful. In the homework I spent more time wrestling with commands in R than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matter.Also, I really didn't need so many subject matter examples about the professor's baby's pooping habits. (And my family is Dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it, so it's not just a matter of the sense of humor not translating)I'm re-taking Statistics with Calculus online at my local state university and frankly, I can't notice any benefit from taking this course first. My current online Statistics with Calculus course is rewarding and I feel like I'm truly gaining mastery of the topics, whereas in the Basic Statistics course I was floundering.The graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done! But I would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more worked-through examples.",2
The lecturer does not clearly explain the topics very well especially on the topics in Probability and Distribution. His presentation in English is honestly quite hard to understand.,2
R labs are too tedious for people with medical or science background! we need explanations rather than trying to figure it out on our own!,2
---------- way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review . the presenter's accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what he's saying. the subtitles sometimes don't accurately represent what he's saying. sometimes there are misspellings - which makes it even harder to know what he's saying. this student was inundated with formulas that needed to be practiced - and i didn't even have time to write them down !,2
"Honestly, I find it very hard to recommend this course to anyone. First of all, let's note that the course covers quite more advanced topics than the previous 3 courses in the specialization, so some extra difficulty is to be expected. However, the main problem I encountered was with the video lectures themselves, particularly during the 3rd and 4th week of the course. The instructor does a very rushed job at explaining everything, constantly giving us tons of information and jargon that is not previously mentioned, and even the examples fail to give us insight at what we need to do and why.Other than the lectures, no external material is given to help us decipher what the professors are saying, other than a few Wikipedia links. I'm not saying that each course should be accompanied by an e-book, but honestly, if I wanted to learn about Bayesian Statistics from Wikipedia I could have well skipped this class.The main reason I'm giving 2 stars to the course instead of 1 is the Labs and the Quizzes. Even though they could use some polishing too, especially the final Lab, they are indeed very helpful and do a much better job at clarifying the concepts presented.All in all, I feel that if you want to learn about Bayesian Statistics you should look for another course, and/or save your money and get yourselves a good textbook.",2
"This course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of Bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the ""Statistics in R"" specialization do for Frequentist statistical methods, but the lack of supporting material (e.g. reading/text exercises directly paired with each lesson) really hampers this. The videos are quite informative, but if you don't catch on to the material based strictly on the videos, the weekly quizzes can be a bit frustrating.",2
I would've saved a lot of time by knowing the R commands used in this course. It took so long to figure out things and I I didn't like the course because of that.,2
"Good introduction to Bayesian concepts, but the course would benefit of some rethought of design of exercises.",2
Too Fast. Video is too short and spend a lot of time in the summary.,2
Very theoretical and unstructured,2
The professors know what they are doing but not good at making the concepts plain to the students who don't have the strong background. Most of the times I would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they don't provide enough explanations.,2
"Mismatch between assessment and course content. After not being able to pass the assessment, I've fallen behind on the course and I'm too busy to catch up.",2
"This course clearly has come ambition to cover important topics on bayesian statistics, however, probably due to time limit, the lecturers have to skim through the contents without further, sometimes necessary explanations. As a result, the lectures are difficult to follow.",2
"This course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics. However, the presentation/videos starting from week 2 really sucks. They change instructors for difference topics and obviously some instructors are not very good at explaining other than reading the material.The videos skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts. And no suggested reading materials at all either. Also the quiz are not very well designed either. For example, some quiz are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself. While some times it is the opposite.The first three courses in this specialization are very good, but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones.",2
there was no home works,2
Way too general..,2
"The instructor kept referring to different authors and books as if she wasn't sure what she was saying was true. She was just reading off a screen and not actually teaching. Might have been easier, and a bit more beneficial, to just read a well prepared set of slides on my own. The first set of quiz questions also weren't really relevant to what was in the actual lesson. Quite disappointed in this part of the specialization as the other sections had in depth presentations, clear information, lots of examples and great slides.",2
I couldn'tfinish this course because it was too much the. I wish it had a more practical aspect.,2
I like that the course covered negotiation in general in relatively short time. However I found the lectures were too dry and theoretical as they lacked real life examples.,2
I had a hard time paying attention to the woman speaking and dropped the course after completing week one.,2
The answers to the test questions can be improved significantly. Most of them can be both justified or refuted.,2
Too many errors in the graded assignments.,2
"Quite disappointing. Lecturers / tutors no responding in time, and the solution provided are questionable, which already happened in earlier courses of this specialisation.",2
"The programming exercises should not be optional. I still intend to do them, but now I passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.",2
"The videos and explanations are very poor. Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake. By reading off a script they are forced to ""hand-wave"" and do not explain concepts covered completely.The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets, which were interesting to do. Will not buy rest of specialization, feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD.",2
Bad teaching quality.,2
the material are great so much information and it is the first from the hole specializationbut! the explanation is so weak doesn't match at all with this big datathe pseudocode is so distracting and hard to readi always get lost and i don't know is it an array in the code or variable and what does he want to do with itthe pseudocode should be just a normal english code saying what to donot an understandable signs :\i am really sad that i couldn't get benefits from this amount of knowledge,2
"These two stars go to the instructor in week 1. I left the course after week 3 because I couldn't tolerate the accents of the instructors. I got frustrated starting from week 2 where I have to reread the subtitles to understand the material. Please let someone who can speak English fluently teach the course, please. The course goes kinds of fast, this is first course of the Specialization and it quickly jumps to Greedy algorithm, really? In general Algorithm course, it is usually taught late.",2
"Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments. The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: ""We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",2
"Update: As I proceed to wk 5, I know why there are some complaint on Dynamic programming,Reduced to 2 stars. Lectures are totally useless for the assignment,The course is really good until week 4 when it deteriorates very quick. No matter how many times I re-watch the lecture, I can't understand much. I ended up using wikipedia for the quiz instead :PI can't use much of the course forum since there are too many posts there and it keep crashing my chrome.This course gets my 3 stars from the first 3 weeks alone, otherwise it gonna be 0-2 stars.",2
"Even though this course covers a lot fundamentals for introduction to algorithm, the course itself is not designed as good as I expected. For starters, the weekly problem designs aren't very good. Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples. Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info. Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.In terms of lecture videos, it's good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained. For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better. Overall, I know that talking and analyzing algorithms can be kinda of boring and challenging, but I wish the course videos could be stated in a more interesting and intriguing way.",2
"Feedback in assignment is not good enough.For example, for the points and segment, there are no correct answer in output as a reference.",2
"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse! It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content. The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations. I expected much more.The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course.",2
"It was really boring, just reading the text in the presentation.It can be made in 4 classes not 8.",2
Informative but not challenging enough.,2
"I have given you a 2* star rating as on finishing my course promptly all the information I submitted has suddenly been locked! I haven't been able to answer a classmate's request to review his work & worse, I haven't been able to print off my own work for reference & this is a REAL project so I need to be able to do this. We were not given notice that this would happen.#disappointed",2
"With a grand title and grand introduction, I found the course very superficial and gained little additional insight form ""Big History"".",2
"Discussions in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussions. I couldn't understand anything from video lectures: cannot understand enunciation not enough detailed, lack of examples related to the assignments. So the only source was repository http://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/ with html files. And a lot of searching through bioconductor forums.I liked the relevance of quiz questions to real life genomic questions, but all quiz questions were outstandingly difficult, because of both lack of examples in lectures and errors in some packages inside bioconductor.Overall I expected much more from this course and I cannot recommend it to anyone.",2
Not very useful. Somehow general.,2
"Interesting topics, and some good information presented on a variety of issues for many animals and situations. However, presented info is often vague and generalized, some sections discuss very little scientific data to back up claims made, and course is generally not very rigorous or challenging.",2
"The course is uneven at best, with some modules providing insights and knowledge and others not so much. The presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice. Some of the material, like the lengthy historical review of Edinburgh's vet school, might be good advertising and interesting, but does not fall under the scope of 'what it takes to be a vet'. Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution.",2
"Content was good, but occasionally VERY hard to understand the lecturers' English. Worth taking though.",2
"Sorry for my English.So many people looking forward to take this course and was very cold, robotic... full of theoretical and repetitive texts.",2
Audio was difficult to hear at times,2
Uninspiring and boring.,2
"This course feels a lot like it's being taught by a non-teaching professor. The lectures are very long, not chunked for easy viewing (to the point where I couldn't download to my phone for offline/off-wifi use). There are very long locally-hosted readings (so they're hard to print and you can't add them to an offline reader app), and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography (rather than actual reading assignments), because there are no links and some refer to ""Selections"" without giving page numbers or, in at least one case, a multi-volume book. The information is comprehensive and very valuable, but the delivery is very lacking as a MOOC.",2
"The early lectures were profoundly dense, monotone and cluttered with non-contextual detail while being (strangely given the subject) seemingly empty of a real desire to share, or convey, understanding. I am confess that, as much as I was looking forward to guest lecturers, I couldn't make it past the first three.",2
to much talk,2
Simply not as engrossing as I had hoped it would be.,2
too many videos and texts.,2
presentation has to be better,2
"A lot of talking, little content.",2
"I enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course. In particular I would highly recommend the Meditation Labs, the Science of Meditation videos and the short presentations from the Tibetan Buddhist monks . But I think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which Dr Germano presented. Since this was he was presenting the main overview of Buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so bad.I understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps Dr Germano's role was more affected than the other lecturers. However it's pretty damning when he manages to to be so off-putting to so many of the students, going on the discussion comments. For my own part, I've studied and practiced Buddhism for more than 30 years and I am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lectures.To be more specificDr Germano's Presentation:-he read from what I presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper. the language was pretty turgid.-he could have just provided a PDF of his paper / notes for us to download. That would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it. doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative way.-MOOCs are wonderful audio-visual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all. The few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that time.Dr Germano's content: the amended title was Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. This is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier Buddhist traditions. Can I suggest that any future version of this course includes the following:-include a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of Buddhism. There was some mention of this in Germano's material but he did it from the Tibetan point of view. Surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject. It's not as if there aren't plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this field.-it's confusing to describe Tibetan Lesser Vehicle practices but then illustrate them with Pali text sources, modern Mindfulness practice, and modern Brahma Vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern Theravadin tradition.-it's also perplexing to include information about many modern Theravadin teachers (Sayadaw, Goenka) in a course apparently not about them.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the videos about Sayadaw and the interview with Sharon Saltzberg, but I am left in the dark about just what differences, if any, there are between them and Tibetan meditation.Overall I think this course was offered prematurely. Much of its content was enthralling, inspiring and very useful practically. However much of it was not.",2
"I am afraid this is only two stars from me for now. It is a course with great content and a lot of potential, but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging. I just hope the team do not give up, but improve this to be one of the best courses on Coursera - it can well be!",2
Needs to be more engaging.,2
"As a buddhist, I feel upset of this course. I expected it to be teach in a better way, with more lectures, PPT presentations...there ought to be a better way of explanation.",2
"The guided meditations were wonderful, but the introductory lectures for Weeks 1-5 were redundant and boring. These lectures could have been much shorter and would have been equally valuable. Dr. Clifford Saron's lectures were interesting.",2
"Speakers sound so monotone and dry that they leave an unenthusiastic impression of an incredibly fascinating subject. Some video lectures and writings are so unnecessarily verbose they cloud what is being taught. Frustratingly fought my way through the lessons and failed to clearly retain what I was trying to learn from Prof. Germano. All apologies to the professor for any harshness, and I MAY try again one day, but not now.",2
"Extremely dry, academic style presentation, could use a LOT of work to make it appeal to others in the future. ""Lesser"" Vehicle is also considered an insult in many circles. Not a good title for a class.",2
The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.,2
"Too simple, no programming, just theory.",2
"I don't feel this course is always very clear. I Feel that I usually am missing the big picture. I follow it in details, but the pace does not match in terms of how you can view the big picture of it.",2
The course content was not very appealing. Explanations were not that engaging. What I really missed was the actual practical aspect where you don't work with command prompt but an much more user friendly interface that is more up to date with current standards.,2
"Too high level. Last assignment too ambiguous, peer assessment was completely random and not reliable to pass the course.",2
"The course a materials are interesting and with significant value, same comment on the teachers, this would be perfect if the third party(the VM) is working fine, I can't say I'm happy about the course where the frustration is probably the right word describing my feeling right now, wish me luck for this week, I might pass might not ......",2
"I wish the courses are more project oriented. This is a very good introduction but, atleast you could provide some optional projects or some tasks.",2
"A lot of the lecture material is unclear and does not fit with the content I've learned from other BI books, lectures, and experience. Additionally, the quizzes don't seem to test for real-world BI knowledge, rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some BI topics. Furthermore, the additional readings need to be culled significantly, it looks like someone just googled BI topics and then copy and pasted the links they found. Please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the 4 to 7 reading that rank the highest. A pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this.",2
Basically just a product demo and the lecturer was very hard to comprehend.,2
Was expecting a deeper unsdersting and knowledge of child nutrition and its impact in the health of little ones... too general.,2
Trivial course,2
"First, I would like to say that with the exception of ONE exam, I was able to take all the tests WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEOS. That shows that this is a poorly put together course. Secondly, this course did NOT cover CHILD NUTRITION, it covered general nutrition. There was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children (although there was useful information in the Lunch Packing Video.) Although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional, it will not let me complete the course without doing the project. I find that extremely frustrating. This course offered a lot of great information (even if it was a weird combo of factual/opinionated) I was frustrated by the fact that this course is OBVIOUSLY geared towards the upper middle class/rich instead of the the everyday blue-collar family. I will do the project to complete the course but was very disappointed in my first course through Coursera.",2
"If you aren't familiar with cooking and nutrition this course is a good fit. However, if you have a bit of background in healthy eating, you may not get as much out of this course.",2
dunno wwhat's the point of making two separate courses with different names.. the content are fundamentally the same.,2
"Changed my mind after watching the cooking. The course on nutrition is just ""ok"" but the teacher has a very skewed idea about what ""healthy cooking"" really is and fails to present with reasons for her recipe choices.Anyway I stopped watching the course, again, the nutritional part is fairly good but if you choose to continue the course at least make sure you keep searching for other points of view as well.Best of luck.",2
It was too simple for my taste and not very fullfilling science wise,2
I found it very basic. There were lots of repetition. I was expecting something more in-depth. Loved the graphics though.,2
"Condescending, not backed up with evidence and preachy. Somewhere in there are some good ideas for making healthy food for kids but given I'm probably of similar politics to what they're pushing and I found it obnoxious I think they're alienating a lot of people. Must do better.",2
"The concepts are good but the delivery is quite dry. Very hard to pass the quizes, as there are no analogies or examples in the videos - just theory. I did not enjoy this course as much as I did the first two in the programme.",2
not good enough!,2
"In my opinion, a very basic course...",2
"It covers theoretical part of ""What big data is"" and basic info about Hadoop. Quality of presentation slides is below average. Most of them are not readable - many fonts, many colors, some with complicated pictures, some with no information at all. Part with Map reduce is just slightly touched, not explained in details, without examples. Practical tasks from hadoop are very easy and they show nothing (just how to navigate over hadoop file system.",2
very boring,2
Quite poor. Just a lot of talk and nothing practical.,2
Too philosophical.,2
"Most of the course is providing useless statistics, i didn't enjoy it and it's a really basic course.",2
"The content of the course is ok. The main problem is that the way the information is presented. Ilkay Altintas, who is the main lecturer, is a sweet woman, but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side. It is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera. Anyone could do that job, and they should have chosen more of an ""news anchor"" type of person with better pronunciation and more flow. It's simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to. Also, 59 dollars is far too expensive for such a short course.",2
"Too basic knowledge, not enough information about targeted therapy, everything is explained without going into any details",2
More challenging questions expected.,2
Mostly common knowledge,2
"An mix of general tips on how to write well mixed with some corporate-specific information. Broad overview, but I didn't really learn anything.",2
Very basic. Tricky quiz questions. There seems to be multiple right answers.,2
Extremely basic. Please put that up front in the course description.,2
It is a good brush up course but a lot of it was common sense.,2
"Very basic, I hoped for a more advanced level.",2
I found the video lectures very choppy and difficult to watch.,2
it's to general. I would like to have done some exercises. Great framework without a punchline.,2
The course was very generic and didn't teach that much. Sorry.,2
"Not too interesting, but certain things were useful.",2
"I must say that the Capstone Project was a good assignment. The issue is that the Peer Reviews were bad. I had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me 0's when the other reviewers gave me 5's. There was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not Necessary.The course needs a specific Rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment. For example, Must Use the Four Forces Model when evaluating Strategy. This way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for. Otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a Classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a 1 or 0 when the model you used demonstrated your knowledge.Capstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that don't read your work and give you the lowest score. Otherwise the Course was great and the information was definitely well put together. The Peer Reviews brought my overall grade lower because I didn't get the High Mark I should have.",2
"This is a hard subject to teach myself. I found the instruction distracting. I think in attempt to be enthusiastic the instructors frittered away my attention. By terrible coincidence, my computer blew up. Real Life intervened in that and other ways. I will continue to try to learn calculus, but this didn't work for me.",2
This comical man makes me very annoy.,2
teacher doesn't teach what is on the quizzes. -_-,2
"Lot of typos and glitches, as well as typing in equations being really difficult",2
get new material - new videos these videos for all your classes are years old - the quizes dont relate to the material taught and it seems you guys got this set up years ago and just forgot about it,2
The excercises should be set up to be more comfortable.,2
"This course is not precisely bad, but it's very lacking compared to the other courses in the specialization. Here are my complaints:-Much of the more interesting bits say ""check out this other course in bioinformatics for details"". Of course, if you aren't registered for that other course, you don't have access to those materials.-Not a lot of thought went into the homeworks. All of them are ""implement this. Here is some pseudocode"", with no ""think about a problem that can be solved with the same ideas"", like the other courses in the specialization (which are, in my opinion, much better).-We saw 4 algorithms for string matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, suffix array matching, Burrow-Wheeler's transform), but virtually no discussion on when to use each one, strengths and weaknesses, and so on. Also, no Boyer-Moore?-After passing all test cases for a homework, we should be able to download a solution with the correct implementation, in order to improve our own.",2
"Test errors, no answers from staff on forums, poor narration at times, audio scripts that do not quite correspond to what is being said... It needs careful reviewing and more user-friendly features being introduced by the organisers.",2
"The last assignment is a time-waster and really poorly designed. Not all adults are into coloring; this is not elementary school and what's the point of coloring a picture of the Arch for you? Frankly I can't be bothered to look up sources for the descriptions of Roman soldiers' attire, and especially to figure what each number is pointing to. It wasn't even always clear what the numbers on the template referred to and two of the numbers were missing. In addition, there were a lot of glitches with the grading software. Finally our questions were almost never answered. Otherwise I found this to be an interesting course and I learned quite a bit from it, although it could have been condensed into three or four classes at the very most. The video lectures were videotaped a bit strangely, with Professor Fine often seeming to talk to an invisible person on the right or the left of the camera, instead of at the viewer. The videos I liked were mostly the office hours ones and the one with the interview with Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove at Park Avenue Synagogue. I could have gotten a very good grade on this course, but the last assignment ruined that. No, I will not be recommending this course or any others by this Professor.",2
Too many generalities and roundabouts and little real detail.,2
"The first courses are great.Unfortunately, the course that covered the installation (week 2 - ""create your first basic application with android studio"") got me lost.",2
"I am very sorry to say that the course is very poor in english (speaking), too bad you do not teach the course in french this could be useful for a lots of french speaking students and better for the quality of the course.",2
"The instructor's explanation is not orderly nor structured, and with a lot of 'noises'.",2
Explanation of concept was poor,2
"The course if well-organized and the instructors do a very good job. However, three weeks of slides and theory and then only the last two weeks of seeing code hardly makes the course project-centered in my mind. Also, requiring learners to upgrade to run an autograder on a quiz is ridiculous!",2
Too much time required. The first Quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lectures. I saved all transcripts and was unable to answer the questions. The Sim's... I have never seen anything like that and again - it most certainly wasn't covered in the lectures. Disappointed in this course. It took 3 hours for each segment of the first week... not 3 to 4 as was stated. Leaving this course.,2
Didnt find it very interesting because of language interpretation issues. The content was good though!,2
"I think the lecture is pretty basic and general compared with the other lectures in the Marketing Mix Implementation course. Many examples were suggested, but I think it would be better if there were more international brands rather than Spanish brands. There were many errors in subtitles. I would appreciate if they were double checked before release.",2
First week of 3 min video. Seriously we want to dive into the subject. And the last two weeks should have more content. Felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that. Understand this should be introduction to Big Data... But the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive.,2
"Course lectures don't seem to match up with the questions on the quiz. It is also not clear if the typed in answers are not read by the program correctly or if the answers do not match what the instructor is looking for, in any case the 3 weeks quiz is very difficult to figure out.",2
"The course is not for beginners and WinForm lovers. This is real re-branding yourself. I would say path to reborn to what real open source world is living in. Low or no help from course instructor, community or google. Course comes in huge amount of concentrated videos. 7 hardest assignments. I would give up on the beginning but commitment is top of all. I respect anyone who has completed.",2
the test is terrible and teacher is just reading the ppt. boring,2
good course and well presented by both.,2
The Subtitles were bad not in sync with the words of the professor and were wrong in many cases.Delivery of lecture and Visuals of the lecture was Ok.Module 4& 5 were very confusing and not interestingThank You Professor for your time and effort,2
Okay course. Techniques and content are a bit too traditional.,2
"the content is simple, I think the course is just for watching during the break.",2
"The touch on a lot of topics, but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course.",2
"Presenter is reading the slides. I feel I would have been able to learn as much by just reading the slides.CDN course is a bit more visual, with some maps and charts used during the course",2
The way the content is delivered is not interesting. And the lecturer basically is reading from the power point,2
Not well prepared course.,2
it is good course,2
"very high level syllabuses, limited application description of BD, poor quiz and questions designed",2
nice teacher but the course is too succint.Each lecture is very short and theoritical with little visual content. the course could/should be more detailed and a section of the course should relate to backyard chicken farming as well. i wish there also had been a section on how to recognise different illnesses in chickens and demonstration on how to humanely kill a chicken for example.I enjoyed the course for what it was but i wish it had been taught with far more depth and breadth,2
Very basic,2
"The explanation of roles is clear. So are other remarkt / piffalls / do's and don'ts. But those are valid for all specialist functionsCouple of remarks:(1) The target audience seems to be the data manager, rather than any executive (C/ C-1 level) of function (HR) dealing with building a data science team.(2) With regard to management and organizing, I missed the ""academic"" level (organisational design) nor did it help in setting up data science (where / how to start ?).",2
I'm not sure if the material presented in this course warranted a whole separate course (even if it only was one week). It probably could have been inserted in various segments of a larger data science specialization throughout the classes. Most of the topics discussed should be common knowledge to a mid-level manager of data science or even strategic marketing in general.,2
"This material is important, but the assessment quizzes were tedious as the right answer often hung on some small obscure remark that was hard to recall.",2
In my opinion this course does not fit to the specialization well. Not sure how big proportion of the specialization students have a background different from data science and are going to manage the data science team.,2
"information is useful. But, still, it is a shame to split one month course to 4.",2
"Sometimes hard to understand the speakers.The medical knowledge is also assumed to be relatively high, with no references to some of the terminology and background reading material that can bring one up to speed.",2
"Some profs are very good, some are terrible. The terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills. As a native Chinese speaker, I find some of the lectures very boring.Good lectures are clear, concise, and right to the point.Good teachers make the learning experience effortless and fun, poor teachers make it like a torture.",2
Really far from the courses by NTU...quite disappointed.,2
"Although very interesting and very innovative in its presentation I had the feeling this course was an introduction to the Master program at the UNIGE, rather than a stand alone course. At times it was difficult to comprehend the speakers. I would have preferred deepening of one aspect of this topic rather than such a broad approach.",2
"The content of the course so far is interesting - and to be fair, I've only completed the first week of this course.Unfortunately, the combination of multiple lecturers within one part of a lesson (often with highly varying accents, reading verbatim from lecture notes) makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff, over-directed, and hard to understand. It's hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and lecturing style of a new person in a four minute video, at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over again.A maximum of two or three lecturers for the entirety of the course (perhaps with the occasional guest speaker) would be helpful. Also, either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with English subtitles, or perhaps having them record the course material in English in something similar to a classroom environment where they're accustomed to lecturing, would make things infinitely easier to follow.This 'too many cooks in the kitchen' issue is what I also suspect happened with the week one quiz. I do not know who generates the quiz questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quiz. Perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quiz checks your knowledge of the source material? Let me put it this way: in my previous university studies, I have never taken a multiple choice quiz where the question starts as 'In your opinion...'Sadly, I will probably drop this class - but the course has sparked enough of an interest where I will probably be picking up some books or doing some informal research on my own about this topic.",2
A very slow and dull course. Lost my interest Half way.Probably a course for non-native English speaking students.,2
"Very basic stuff. Assignments can be done only in the paid version, but as it's so basic and everything is peer graded for me the course isn't worth the money (compared to other paid language learning classes online or in-person).",2
Very basic stuff,2
not as good as the others and way too quick,2
"What I liked: Materials have quality and a professional approach. Speakers add value to the discussion. Toolkit is important.What I didn't like: This course, as most of Northwestern courses, is excessively short in video lectures per module. In this course each module had about 20 to 30 minutes of videos per module. That is clearly insufficient. Most courses in Wharton's, U. Michigan's and Illinoi's specializations in Coursera, have more video materials per module, than your courses in totality... 1.5 to 3 hours per module in the three institutions mentioned in average per module against about 2 hours of videos on all your course modules combined. That is a serious and very salient gap, that I think you should reflect on. In my opinion, quality MOOC's either singular courses, either specializations have to be very well balanced in content - both in quality and quantity. Your courses have very reasonable quality, but fails completely in quantity. As competition in the online e-learning domain increases at an impressive speed, you should benchmark what I mentioned above and do something about it, or probably after 2/3 runs of your courses, people with churn for more addedd value offerings in the dimensions that I pointed out.Good luck.",2
"While course uses a genie method for presentation the content, Quizzes are just made to accomplish one goal: to make sure you have memorized every small detail haven said in the course. Even if someone memorizes the details like specific names and dates, for how long he/she is going to keep it in mind? 2 days? On week?",2
"I founded so basic, I didn't feel engaged to continued.",2
"Great idea but unprofessional design and programming.Looks like nobody double-checked it before starts to offer it, especially for money.Almost every Quiz and separate questions has programming bugs.Waiting for ver 2 ASAP.",2
"The course covers very useful and interesting topics, not in very much detail though. It is useful to begin with the topics, but it is really not more that a thin introduction.",2
Lots of theoretical information but very little practical information about what to do with people with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2
"Aimed at those needing to get services -- in a spectrum of family living. Too much on California systems, not enough on direct coping with day-to-day.",2
"Short, superficial, and sometimes even condescending towards people with ASD.",2
"This course is informative and introductory. It has a value in generating a general awareness about ASD. It would be useful for parents and learners who are new to disability issues. The content can be used for introducing and familiarizing with clinical practice with ASD. But this course has the limitation on following grounds1. The contents of the course are coloured with medical perspective and with pathological view point2. At some point this course appeared like an advertisement for the institute and its research work3. This course tried to cover too many things like theory, practice, research, experience and so on. But at the end it failed to do justice all4. Finally the contents are infected with virus of medicine, market and military science. Terms such as intervention, package, therapy so many terminology. The unfaithful use of ""social"" in few instance look like an altruism to social science by dominant discipline.I am sure that this course has market. Evidence based research/ practice will corroborate it. Best wishes",2
"Lots of overlap in the videos, not a lot of information on C++ features, too few hands-on activities with the features taught.",2
Very poorly designed course material. Everything has been split up.,2
"- Assumptions about the student are not clear, before starting the course.Instructor examples are not practical in all contexts.Jump to dijkstra in very second week, without clarity on major C++ concepts and examples, is too much an expectation from the student switching from C to C++ for the first time.Confusion with deadline for assignments.too many lectures during later week courses, as if the effort is to crunch everything in that week and complete the course.If its spaced properly with examples and problems over few more weeks, it would help.",2
"The instructor speaks too slow. Teaching concepts that are not valid anymore. e.g. prefer inline over function call, const vs #define, declaring variable anywhere in the code etc...The topics are too small and too much time is devoted to them.",2
"Quizzes are trivial. Makes the certification worthless.Prof. Campbell is not a good lecturer.The topics are treated mostly superficially, then suddenly go into too much detail sometimes (how to use IntelliJ IDEA, machine learning).Subtitles are very buggy.I enjoyed Mr. Farivar's talks much more, it seems like he knows what he is talking about and his presentations are well structured.",2
"The course brings lots of information, but the assessments are not at all creative, so it becomes a lot of theory with little practice.El curso trae mucha información, pero las actividades no son ní un poco creativas. Entonces se converte en mucha teoria con poca practica.",2
Needed of specific information to now how to be more creative in schools as profesionales,2
the lessons were too long in duration and i was really bored because the teaching didn't have anything engaging me to be more eager to listen and all the slides were with the same background and design and there were no pictures or animation or fun stuff to create some kind of diversity in the progress of the course.,2
"Not very much in depth and does not offer complete lecture notes, which are necessary for answering the quizzes...",2
"I get lost a bit too often.The teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones (e.g. exponential distribution is explained as ""for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes"" and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on, but he does not say WHAT IT MEANS - is it the probability that I will meet an oncoming bus? is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus? is it the average waiting time? is it average number of buses that come every hour? - but there is detailed explanation of what A squared means in lesson two (!))The teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula gives.But I take it as a challenge and I intend to finish the course despite all of that. Sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations. And maybe it is me, maybe I was not born to be a statistician. Maybe there are people that find this stuff easy and understand it right away.I really like the quizes. They are HARD.One last thing: Wearing white shirt and using white marker makes it impossible to read what he writes. But I take it is part of the challenge ;-)",2
"If you already know everything about the topic and just forgot some little things or you are very strong in calculus, this may be a nice refresher. Otherwise, not very useful. Really dense and little explanation. I liked the Youtube MIT course on Probability (it includes Bayesian Statistics) much more, since it has good explanation of the concepts.",2
Some matters were just given formulas and there was a lack of practice. The course should cover less materials or be longer to be effective in teaching.,2
"No TA, staff or instructor presence during the whole course. Students are left to their own devices.",2
"This is the rating for the whole specialization.1) Some course are nice and well done, but probably only 2-3 of the 9 (The entrepreneur one is really well done). But most of them are simply useless.2) It's too long. For the same amount of knowledge, I could have done just 3 WELL DONE courses.3) Most of courses are just things people read in front of a screen, without any passion or interest. And the concept are so easy I am wandering if they need to be teached at all.4) The exam are just sloppy. Even a monkey that didn't watch the video could answer them (sometimes I try to do the same and it works. If I already know what you will ask me, which kind of knowledge are you supposed to teach me?),5) About this project, the instructions are messed up.In the end, I finish it because it was my first specialization, and I was lucky enough to do the interesting one at the beginning, so I feel compelled to end it, but really, I am not sure It was worth my time.",2
It seems like the team have tried to do the whole course in one take! Perhaps some practice would have been in order? at least to work out what they are going to say next.... content is ok so far but delivery is tough to listen to.,2
This course was a very disappointing experience since it is designed around depending on peer reviewed assignments that don't get graded. I have been waiting for over 3 months for the 1st assignment to get regraded.In the future I suggest the creators of this course stay away from peer graded assignment as it puts students in a position where their grade depends on others and not the knowledge the student acquires from the course content.,2
"Interesting concept.However, in my opinion, there is sometimes a lack of :- practice especially for the coding part (entire courses are exclusively theoretical)- explanations (during the courses, I have heard several times this sentence : ""don't ask me why"", which is disappointing in my learner experience and frustrating not to get the answers I was expecting.)- subject mastering (the ""teacher"" seems to be lost sometimes and admits not being able to explain some parts of the course, which may confuse and demotivate learners not knowing exactly what they are being teached and how it works.Moreover, in the courses covering database subject, security issues are involved. Example week 6 - c video how to send a ROAR from the app to the internet)",2
"This Course is very easy to learn, all it's themes are so good explained.I'm sorry but I might to change the RATE of this course.All went well until the course started reading the explanation of code , after that ... I lost , and I could not continue , because It just came out of nowhere , coding , there wasn't a previous step that says , we will encode here , or are we going to do this somewhere ... just appeared and disappeared as it appeared ... ... we were very well ... but I can not say much more !",2
I can't understand why this guy is trying to teach me if he doesn't know how to code?!,2
"Lectures were extremely good, but assignments and graders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from. Professors and TAs were not active in the forums.",2
No slides or writen support to guide the student.,2
"Unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time. The content of the course lacks in substance compared to the ""An Introduction to American Law"" course. So much time spent on European effect on British law: this is not a course for lawyers, I would presume, but supposed to be an introduction.",2
"All talking, don't even have slides to assist with the presentation of materials, also seemed to have focused too much on the European Union/Convention instead of the Common Law itself.",2
thanks it just needs more time,2
"Cheesy. If you mess up in your delivery, press the little button and start over! Needs some judicious editing.",2
I did not meet my expectations from the course,2
"The idea of having support with the videos does not work with this course. Also, the exams do not match at all with the information provided. The anwers to the exams are so relative or subjective, and that's a problem for those who does not domain English very well, just like me.",2
"A lot of reading material is unavailable (link does not work or it is behind paywall).I also found the videos lacking. For example, there were 5 important tips and only one was given, before jumping at next topic.",2
"Brief, high-level ideas. Could use more specific examples.",2
"I think the teacher was very welcoming, but the content was less than enough to answer the quizzes. In the quizzes, every answer choice was correct and there wasn't any possible way to discern. What the teacher said and complemented with the lectures didn't match with the question answers. So, my score is ""2"".",2
"There wasn't a lot of information inside the video and the test's questions hade multiple possible answer.However, the links to ressources such as HarvardReview or Inc.com were pretty good and usefull.",2
"I expected much more information in videos. Instead of that, videos are very short and provide only few information and don't allow us to pass the exams at the end of each module. There are some link to websites where you can learn much more and which are not even written by the professor.",2
"a nice ""entry level"" course lacking a forum discussion... was not even able to report some issue with videos and no explanation provided with quizzes results :/",2
Tiny lectures and no readings from professional books,2
The material was well delivered but I found it distracting to go between the video lecture and the additional material.,2
The value of this course is the collection of reading materials that can be found in the same place. The lectures don't add much to the course.,2
not so much live examples full of theories.this has been thought in class it self.,2
The materials explaining the course are too poor. This is a core course in the specialization.The quizzes are out of the material's league,2
"The course and presentations were very informational and good. I enjoyed that aspect. I would have rated the course 4-5 star based on that. The reason for the low rating was the 6th module, and the fact that I felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in Spark (building out the Jupiter notebook). We really did not cover much of that, and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work. Even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best. I have a full time job and a family, I am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste. While I am not opposed to some searching of other sources, I would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden. I believe that if you are going to test people on something, you should at least cover it in some sense.",2
The VM doesn't work out of the box sometimes for the hands on activities,2
"Poor presentation of topics, I don't recommend.",2
"The last assignment of the course is, compared to the others, more difficult. In my case, I ran into several errors which I couldn't get help in solving by using the course Forum, as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead. I had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using Spark framework (nor any of the other ""Big Data"" tools explored in the course).I also found some of the videos by PhD. Amarnath Gupta were difficult to understand, his examples were unclear and, in my opinion, too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread.",2
I miss a proper buildup from the theory to the practical exercises. Especially the last quiz I found very difficult based on the limited number of exercises presented upfront.,2
I had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running Spark in the VM and there isn't a lot of help available online.,2
"Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts. However, as others have mentioned some content (especially in early modules) could either be combined or ommited. Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time.The quizes have badly worded questions. Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class. Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work.I'm hoping this particular module is revised. For those just interested in learning Spark or Mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research.",2
"Quizes are inconsistent with given dataset. Questions are bad: i.e. what is the difference between ""number of distinct countries mentioned"" and ""number of countries mentioned in tweets"".",2
"Weeks 1 &2 were worthwhile. Weeks 3 & 4 were very thin, not really up to expectation based on first course or even first two weeks",2
"If there hadn't been so many hiccups with the videos and quizzes I would recommend this course. However, I lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete videos and trying to complete quizzes covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the videos. Then had to go back and Review all the videos once they had been re-uploaded. It was a very frustrating experience. I lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes.",2
The course started really well and followed on nicely from the first course in the series but I'm really disappointed and frustrated with the video editing issues. Many were fixed but there are still some errors/omissions and the second half of the course was very short of content compared to the rest. Such a shame as I'm sure the writers really know their material and conveyed so well when the content was there. I'm looking forward to the next course and hope the material is all ready to go!,2
"I had really high expectations from the course, I believe but it wasn't upto the mark. All it went through was some basic though I would have expected to go in details esp. for Aperture, Shutter and DOF.I am not sure if that i going to be covered in next unit but having gone though the basics in 1st unit, that was expectation in 2nd unit.",2
"Machine learning is too simplified and spark part is not even explained, also very little relation of all course with Big Data.",2
Almost a useless course - ML overview using KNIME which gives no insight whatsoever.,2
really... strange. Kind of childish.,2
too much external references,2
"I had some issues with this course which is why I rated it a 2.First off, let me start by saying this is a very good overview of what the Cybersecurity Terms are, but I wish it went deeper into the subject.1. Having to pay just to take the quizzes for an overview course is kind of a joke. I could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a website, then asking for 50 bucks is kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2. Why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms? You could have done that, kind of a waste of time for those other people. I am guessing that you had to pay them. Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take the quizzes.3. Where was the real life experience? Explain to me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of networks as securities. That would at least be worth 50 dollars, for some real world practical use. I could have easily googled these terms and have in the past. I thought it would contain more detailed information about the subject considering is technically an online course.",2
No useful info for me,2
"Too short lectures;The study material is not properly defined, only entire books to read as reference;The tasks/tests are all literal parts of the books to complete, no understanding of the subject is motivated, but memorizing and tiring reading of books without proper directions.",2
Boring course... useless videos... only the referential resources and exercises are good,2
Poor video lessons. The course is sustained by the reading material alone.,2
"This is the poorest Coursera course I have participated in. Very few and short videoes that only scratches the surface of Cybersecurity. Instead you are directed to massive amounts of readings with no guidance on what should be read. To read it all includes sometimes +1000 pages for one week (not going to happen). I ended up just reading the introduction, glancing through the texts and searching for the answers for the quiz.This course totally miss the purpose and potential of MOOCs and the great Coursera platform. It's a shame.",2
"Poorly made very short videos that do not explain the subject matter, some of the content is outdated.",2
"The course is for an overview of many aspects of cybersecurity. There are many resources to read, videos that briefly discuss concepts of the week. Then there are quizzes and discussions with the topic of the week, doing the possibility at the student to talk about that and post his idea for assimilate concepts and reaching goals of the course. This is useful also for discuss with other students and how your ideas is viewed.I think there is a very basic course in his entire length, with more reading lectures at academic or professional level not for a beginner. it can be adding videos with more length and in-depth that in a easy way the ten domain about cybersecurity.",2
Very very broad with no real depth. Basically a very light summary of what cybersecurity is. You could watch all of the videos in 30 min probably. The real course comes from the reading and peer discussions.,2
This course is not prepared as well. You see several video with animated presentation and typical (vocabulary) terms.It is not for beginners because in course you didn't find answers.It is not for pros because in course you didn't find interesting material.Hope that instructors can change course to better.,2
Could have utilized video lectures more. Questions on final exam did not seem to relate to materials covered in course. Course seems to just comprise 1 or 2 minute long video lectures and then direct students to vast amounts of online reading material.,2
Videos seemed disjointed. Assignments were marked inconsistently. Did not find the subject interesting but the course did give useful insights into the industry.,2
Videos are very brief - slide presentations of course outline. One has to depend entirely on reading materials to understand the course.,2
"Pretty average and way too short/fast paced videos. Felt like it was put together on the fly. I don't usually review but this was not great, the reading material they linked to was the best content overall.",2
"The videos and documents are not balanced with the quizzes. The quiz questions are sometimes verbatim sentences from one book with a missing word - which I find hardly a test of acquired knowledge. The course must rise above only a few definitions and rough concepts. Most of the video's hardly offer insights - they last only 2 minutes and cover a few of those definitions. This course has a lot of potential, but in its current format and content it was a disappointment.",2
I'm going to try to continue to the end but the first three weeks is probably 15 minutes of videos with the most annoying music available playing for way too much of the content. I also didn't need to watch 10 seconds of an animated caveman grunting and smashing things on the screen. I would probably enjoy that part more if I felt that the information that is supposed to be learned over three weeks was more information than 5 pages in a book.,2
One of the absolute worst final exams I've ever seen. Vague questions coupled with synonymous answers form a frustrating experience that ruins an otherwise decent entry in security topics.,2
Very basic,2
"This required a lot of work with little gained. Some questions, referring to budgets and site layouts, required skills that weren't learned in the course. The 3 word feedback comments I got from all reviewers did not feel like worthy responses to the amount of time I put into this project. Additionally, I was graded negatively by some reviewers without reason, as happened in other sections. Overall, not really worth the money for a paid certificate. Would be nice if maybe for the capstone only, some sort of professional or professor weighed in on your project for some legitimate and helpful critique.",2
"Don't have the certificate to certify that I've undergone the course. It is sad. The content of the course is good. However, without the certificate it feels like all my efforts have gone in vain. Please look into it.I would like to receive the certificate, I am willing to pay for it. But I don't know how",2
very slow and boring. needs better and more relevant examples. Instruction should be more fast paced.,2
I didn't learn many data science concepts in this class,2
I am a developer and know how to create advanced websites. This course has less use for me as in my day job i create sophisticated websites,2
"seemed like a filler, nit are why this was included",2
"Would like to use the time to learn more machine learning/predictive technique, etc.",2
Some of the assignments seemed overly complicated and irrelevant to the topics discussed. On a few occasions the videos would mention something but never discuss the reasoning. Once I posted to the forum and no one answered so I never asked about the other questions I found during the videos.,2
Pros:Effort has been taken in putting up the assignments.Cons:Quality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through . Instructors have rushed to present course material . I would not recommend this course . Princeton and Stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics.,2
I couldn't take the instructor seriously. There were too many comparisons to Harry Potter and various three and five act formulas. I wanted something that would be practical and adaptable to the ideas that I'm working on. This just wasn't the right course for me. The assignments felt like they were pointless as well.,2
"Too prescriptive and prone to lists. ""Do these 21 things when editing a novel"". If that's what I was looking for, I could search the web for blogs. Maybe this was too beginner focused for me, but I'm not sure I learned anything really useful here.",2
Very basic course with an extremely limited view on what makes a good plot.,2
"Felt very much like an exercise in writing-by-numbers. Assignment instructions were too vague and the pass/fail grading system meant lots of classmates were upset that their work was not appreciated or understood. So many people on the course do not have English as a first language that the marking is often erratic. Great that non-native speakers are trying to write in English, enriching the canon, but in those circumstances a pass/fail system seems misguided.",2
I hope the instructions were cleary and not too vague that it was open to many interpretation. An example would have helped and the rubrics/criteria for grading should have been shown beforehand so students would be guided what points they would consider when making their piece.,2
"The material isn't bad, and it does provide some interesting prompts to think and write about. But, the curriculum is not at all creative. It focuses on easily teachable and repeatable lessons that teach a certain, standard way of doing things. It tries to reduce creative writing down to a formula instead of acknowledging that many compelling and successful stories can have almost any imaginable form. If perhaps many types of structures had been emphasized or structures had been pointed out as optional, this would have been mitigated, but the time period is so short that there's no time. The result is a class that feels more like ""Writing: How to Make a Formulaic, Sellable Book"" than anything with ""Creative"" in the title.",2
"Undoubtedly the course instructor is very knowledgeable. However I did not take away as much from this course as I would like to. It is mostly theoretical; very limited examples. I also missed the bio in biostatistics. A title like ""Mathematical Statistical theory boot camp"" would be better suited. I believe having a set of cases that get reused in some form over all lectures would be very beneficial for -at lease mine- understanding the topics. The form of lecturing is not using the benefits that an online platform offers. So instead of short interactive videos, this has slides with lengthy essential spoken word with it; hardly summaries.",2
"He terribly prepared us for quizes and gave about 4 examples in the entire course. I filled a notebook with about 40 pages of notes, about 3 of which were useful for the quizes. Though content was good, but i found myself looking things up because of his somewhat neive explanations of difficult concept.",2
"Very, very, very basic intro. The entire 4 weeks could have (and should have) been condensed into 1 week.",2
i feel that the course need more explanation .. i got really lost in the begging of the HW,2
"Very basic course, I was able to complete the 4 weeks on content in a weekend. I would recommend skipping this module and moving directly to the R Programming course.",2
"A very big difficulty for me, French people who uses to speak english everyday for may work is that :1) Teachers don't do any effort to speak slower and to articulate2) As with all other courses I've attended in english, it's impossible to read a transcription, even in english, while reading slides.Slides are not sufficient by themselves, i.e. without commentary beside. The workaround I've used is to print french translation or english transcription and read it, trying to guess which part suited with which slide ...For a non-free course, it's not really professional ...",2
"This is really bad structured. As analogy - imagine a cookbook that says: in chapter 8 you'll learn how to cook pies, but here in introduction let me tell you how to add baking powder in them. It is not useless information it is just very out of place.Learning some git commands was the most usefull in the course for me. (Though again, why would you first show the commands and just after that explain what's the tool for and where to download it?)And by the way it takes half a day to cover all 4 weeks material (listened through all videos, installed the tools). Which is not bad, just of other users information)",2
Too basic!,2
"This module is just enough material for 1 or 2 lectures with ""How to get started"" notes..",2
Only informative. Not worth it outside the specialization.,2
"I mean, it's replicated in the next classes, and it has silly questions in the practice quizzes. It's not worth it. Just kill this.",2
"Too easy, very basic",2
"A good intro to the tools required for a Data Scientist. However, could cover the usage of the terminal and Rstudio better.",2
"Is this entire course going to be watching videos of powerpoint slideshows, wrapped in a rather buggy website?",2
I didnt learn anything about data science. I could have learned how to install all those tools by myself,2
"It is too easy as a ""university"" course. It is much more like a pratictioner course. The final exam is ridiculous, really too easy.It can be thought as a week course instead of a four week course.",2
"This was really basic information. It's not really a 4 week course. It takes several hours. The info is necessary, but it's sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course.",2
a bit too simple to be a paid course,2
"There just wasn't much to this class. It's not bad information, but it could have been done in one week.",2
"Very very introductory. I didn't find the tooling aspects of this course particularly helpful, but I'm not in the target audience. It's length was misleading -- I completed the work in two days easily, but I am a technologist, and already had the tools installed. If you use GitHub and RStudio, the meat of the course is only about an hour of the lecture.",2
I thought this was very very basic,2
"The course is fine, however its more an introduction than a course. The course in itself doesn't teach much, should have been the first week of subsequent courses. I went through all 4 weeks in 1 week, the whole course is mostly about downloading different tools and signing up for accounts.What I didn't like is that the teachers seem to be really concerned about their reputation and workload. Its repeated several times that you shouldn't email the teachers with questions and that online questions should be of a certain standard, its understandable but its a bit patronizing. I think teachers should be available for questions, even if its only through the forum (which they are) Its understandable that there are a lot of students so direct emails might overwhelm but that's just part of the job, we pay for the course, we should also get support when its not working for us.Overall I wouldn't advise taking this course if you aren't taking it as part of the specialization.",2
"Would like to have seen more material using git and git bash commands. More repetition here would be helpful. Seems like a lot of this information will be lost or forgotten when it comes time to use it, especially as it relates to the Data Science Specialization.",2
"Very shallow overview, not really a full course I'd say.",2
Very basic,2
Very basic even for people with no DS background.Issues with quiz having passed and results showing as failed. Inability to speed up and move on to next module,2
Not sure this should be a course that is charged ....on to the next one now.,2
Introductory Course mostly around installation and setup for the other courses in Specializations,2
"This course is not very ""beginner friendly""",2
It's an extremely basic introduction... which doesn't help in much for the next session (R Programming),2
Extraordinarily basic. Entire thing can be done in about two hours.,2
"Jumps around, doesn't put anything into ""real world"" examples.",2
"Too basic, this should just be a read",2
they made this many courses as they can earn more money.I dont think this course should me taught seperately,2
"The course is well structured and provides a good introduction, however, I expected a bit more from a course that costs 20 pounds than just a few clips on how to install and set-up software/create a github account etc. This information is available for free online on the websites of the respective software.I understand that such an introduction is needed for the course, but then do not offer it as a separate 20 pound module. Instead include it for free with any other 'specialization' you can buy.",2
the speech is too fast to be catch up with and doesn't have much useful contents,2
Sound is too quiet,2
"It is a nice introduction, but the material is barely worth a one week orientation lesson (I have completed it in about 4 hours with watching all the videos, taking detailed notes, and completing the quizzes for 100%) . Why should we pay for a specialization preview, we can read info about the separate courses on our own? I am really looking forward the next courses in the specialization since I really need a good course in statistics and this seems to be one, but the first course should be eliminated. The installation of R and github account videos should be added to the next course as an introduction.",2
It's more a preview than an actual class.,2
This should not be a course of its own.,2
"Extremely remedial. Not worth the time or cost on it's own, unfortunately it's required for the specialization.",2
I didn't get much out of it,2
Really poor quality of the material.,2
"This should not be its own course, as it would be pretty useless if you were doing it on its own without doing any of the other courses. The end of course project literally being just to make a Github account and download R-studio could be quickly covered in the first week of the other courses.",2
"Might be useful for total newbies, but this was very simple for me.",2
Barely any depth,2
Too short and easy.,2
"Maybe, I am already somehow experienced, but I think that the time I spent on that was a waste :/",2
Not much substance to this course,2
Nice introduction but actually very little content,2
Very introductory. This material could have been compressed into 1 week.,2
"I think this course could have been done in two 30 minute videos. It jumps in with overviews but contain some high level items you won't understand until later in the course and it really doesn't give enough context to be meaningful at the time. It almost seems like it was thrown together without a clear mission of what should be in the introduction. Being a developer who has used some of the tools in this toolbox (Git, GitHub, Command Line) this intro really glosses over tools that most non developers won't understand. If I had a say in what should be in this intro it would be one video end to end of setting up the tools. The second video would be all about the history and logic and some of the applications we will be exploring without all the r formulas in the slides.",2
Very basic introduction to Data Science. Seasoned programmer or other IT professionals are likely to find this course really weak.,2
This could probably be compressed into a single week of setup for the R Programming course. There isn't much in terms of substantive learning here.,2
The course is very simple,2
Very little information for the cost. I was done with the whole course in a few hours. The review in the next course covered most of the same things. It certainly wasn't worth the price.,2
"You will learn some command line commands, git, Github, and what you will need for eventually using R.I was a bit annoyed that this course is a requirement for the Data Science certification (which is what I am after). I already knew everything taught in this course and was a bit annoyed I had to pay for this in order to complete the track. I think 'courses' that are fully setup like this should be opt-in not required.",2
"It is generally good course, but I feel it is just a combination of very little tools, skills and ideas. I believe it is quite complicate for me to understand, esspecial git and github. I think it is better to combine this course in other courses where you need it.",2
"Good introduction of what is to come, but nothing too provocative or thought provoking.",2
"Dry videos. Most classes are someone showing how they do something their way, rather than guiding or teaching with the intent to have the student absorb and re-apply principles.Very difficult for a student to absorb material from this video series",2
"Hard to follow with a lot of technical intructions right off the bat with inadequate explanation, a lot of ""read more about this at <insert URL>."" Videos were boring and the instructor was invisible just reading off the slides. Not very engaging.",2
Didn't provide much info beyond the basics of git. Could have skipped this one.,2
"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.",2
It is too small and shallow. Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.,2
"The content is OK, but that's about it. Near zero interaction from staff, short videos leave a lot to be desired, and worst of all, there seems to be a problem getting everyone's assignments peer reviewed (which makes no sense).There is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a ""contact us"" link on a page, but get this, the link isn't there. Students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the non-existant link. In an online forum it's important to actually address concerns. Replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages. And that's the feeling I get here.This course requires a DIY attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedback.If you're looking for a good example of online learning, look elsewhere.",2
The quizzes are not set up correctly and you get marked wrong when you put in the correct answers. It seems that the course was rushed and not properly tested before it accepted students. The content is good and that is why I gave it more than one star.,2
"Please stop reading from the screen, it looks ridiculous.",2
the course really covered information I knew but made simple concepts complex - that is just my opinion,2
"Amy Blooms assignments were so complicated and obtuse that they were hard to dive into. The lectures didn't particularly hold me , either. Often, what the lecture was titled and what was taught seemed totally unrelated. Could be improved but at least it kept me writing.",2
I am honestly not a fan of Amy's teaching style. She seems to have a discussion with herself about character building techniques but not really explain the technique nor structure it for the student.There are too many shop talks.I would rather have a structure explained to me and then hear a discussion... the way Brando Skyhorse does in the Plot course... really a let down. I will have to buy the book she keeps averting I guess... after spending quite good money on the course already. Pity,2
Instructions were very unclear compared to the rest of the courses in the specialization.,2
"I didn't find this course particularly helpful or useful. I'm not sure why, there was a disconnect somewhere, I think maybe that I didn't receive the help that I feel I still need on the subject of how to create a great, memorable, believable character. Also, some of the assignments were confusing. Nothing really stands out about this course, and it was actually a bit boring and I don't feel I learned anything related to the subject. Everything about this class needs some work: the videos, the instruction/syllabus/content, and the assignments. Sorry, I didn't like it. =(",2
I didn't think there were many solid pointers...and not much that was original coming from the instructor herself.,2
This was my least favourite course in the the Creative Writing Specialisation. I learnt a bit about creating characters but I found the lessons bland and the assignments difficult to understand.,2
"this was my least favorite of the classes - the lectures ere not informative, and far too lofty. The style class, the plot class and the setting class all had detailed, concrete teachings, whereas these lectures were too airy. Most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other. The assignments required real craft however, and it would have been helpful to LEARN those skills in the modules.For example, one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting, while they were not actually there - say a divorced nurse in a hospital. Not once in the lectures were we ever taught HOW to do this. We watched a series of author fireside chats, and then people bumbled through the assignment. I really wanted Amy Bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say ""this is a woman, she's divorced, she's middle class, she tends to get very angry when things don't go her way"" or whatever,and then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her - she throws things, she's disorganized, she writes mean notes in the patient charts.I wanted her to teach. She seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action. I mean, for a beginning writer, its helpful to just make a list of details about a character - where they're from, what they like or don't like, what sort of flaws they might have and so on. We did barely any of this. It was assumed we knew the basics of characterization, but most students did not!some of the other students frustration and confusion came out in the peer review, which was a bad sign.",2
"I didn't find this module very helpful and some of the assignments were truly confusing. I wish there was more ""meat"" in the sessions and more availability to access the lecturers more readily when there was confusion. I don't like the fact I pay money for other people to ""assess"" my work when half of them don't even read my submissions properly. Or the question. Or both. So if the lectures don't stretch me, I find my money spent unwisely.",2
"Very limited teaching and contradictory assignments. For those with English as a second language be aware this course uses grammatical terminology but in a stylistic way and can cause a lot of confusion. Assignments are weak but as a whole for the four courses making up the Capstone just grit your teeth and get through it, the least enjoyable and instructive of all four.",2
Could have been better. It was little boring when this type of course should be super exciting,2
I don't like pay to submit courses.,2
"The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same. I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value. But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes. On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach. Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together. I wish you luck for the future.",2
Strong accent,2
"I was looking for a course that discusses how to think about the data and how to manipulate the data based on the questions you have. This course was more basic and didn't really focus on the many ways of visualizing the data to tell a story. The course did not discuss the pros and cons of each type of visualization (e.g., pie chart vs. line graph vs. column chart etc but of course more complex because we are using tableau) with the type of question and answers you are looking for. This type of content is what I was most interested in.",2
This course basically treats you like an extremely slow-learning retarded individual. Totally waste of your time by watching a bunch of videos. The contents are so thin. All the contents covered in these course videos can be summarized in a 10-minute video. If you have a lot of time you don't know how to spend. Enroll in!,2
Each week was only about an hour. Most MOOC courses I've taken have at least 3 to 4 hours of content and learning. Very little learning for a 4 week course. This is a 1 week course stretched out to 4 weeks.,2
The instructor moves very slowly (both speaking and covering topics). Points get belabored (I usually watched the lectures at 1.5x speed but I also have some basic Tableau experience).,2
"The course is very preliminary. Its content can be covered in one session and does not need 4 weeks. The assignments were not clear enough. The course material can not be downloaded and can not be retrieved or used as reference after finishing the course, unlike other courses I have taken with Coursera, but in other University.",2
"Unsyncronize subtitle with audio. Please fix thisIMO, I think the video must not too long. (below 10 minutes/video), so lecturer separated it to more segment. And give pop-up quiz in video",2
"good course, but the way it is required to be done sucks",2
"It's a bit too simple all of this. There is not enough depth in the course. No way I would give 71 $ for such an introductory material. The best part of the course are the additional resources lists. The good and bad examples are useful as well, but they are all too simple as well.The videos are good quality though and there is some information that is useful. If you are looking for a simple introduction / never seen an interview / have no experience with public speaking / have not taken many oral exams then this is for you.I rate this at 2 stars because I was expecting more. A lot more. ""Mastering..."".. really? More like ""Not completely failing..""",2
I am not sure peer review is eventually working in this course.,2
"I have switched session, but for the second time nobody reviewed my assignment for the second time! I have a doubt about such approach and this particular course as one before a capstone project (to my opinion it should be held after a capstone)",2
"Most of contents are already in the books like Cracking the Coding Interview and similar ones. If you have them, you don't need to take this course.It can be good for students who have never had an interview.",2
Very theoretical and mathematical and not enough real examples.,2
"This isn't a beginners course. I dropped out in first week. I took every note I could and reviewed again and again. I really think the instructor is an intelligent man, but I'm not quite sure he understands how to teach well. I'm really disappointed that I didn't get to take anything away from this class.",2
A really hard class for anyone not graduated from collage.,2
"Links to 4 year old articles, websites and TED talks that can be found on Google don't really constitute a course to me sorry.",2
Cyber Security is miniscule in the topic. Mobility poses severe cyber security threat and syllabus is talking about MDM which is for compliance and cyber security.,2
"I probably should wait to finish this course before reviewing, but I'm halfway through and have found my motivation gone--I'm finishing it just to finish it. The delivery adds nothing to the content, especially as much of it is simply the presenters reading lists also shown on screen. Class content would better serve the students as a searchable PDF. And why are there super-specific questions on quizzes about things like what specific funders require in a grant proposal? That's information that you look up when you need it, not that you quiz people on. This class is a let down.",2
"can't wait to rate this course! I hope I could give 1 start but to show respect I rated it 2. It's just because I personally don't like the instructor and the way he talks, which could ruin the course! I truly hope we could have another instructor in the following courses or the whole specialization would be ruined and so would my interest in database.",2
"I could not finish because videos were stuttered - even with bigger bandwidth - and as a consequence I could not finish the course and the exercises in my limited free time (therefore, only 2 stars). Is the problem solved now - cause I d like to resume the course again. If that's more successful now I would start the next parts of the specialization.Thank you for an answer!",2
"Not enough implication from the instructors in the course. Students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.Peer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.That's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that.",2
"Poor english, hard to follow assignments (instructions spread out over 3-4 microsoft word documents with no links between them). Teaches SQL with MixedCase namings, all-named constraints and other non-standard syntax.",2
"Expected a lot more from the course. Also, the teaching style isn't very engaging either.",2
Assignments are very inaccurate. Mess with table and field names. Oracle VM is very heavy and slow to use on regular laptop.,2
Professors accent very hard to understand. Week 5's lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class,2
"This is a complex course for people who don't know R Studio. While it is not very hard to learn R Studio (even for people who are not comfortable with coding), it is very difficult when people get stuck. I did not get the much needed support when my R studio installation failed or when installation of libraries failed with error messages. The instructor was good, course content is good, but the lack of a suitable support representative for such complex subjects pulls down the reputation of this course. Please provide a good support personnel to at least help with online queries.",2
"If you already took statistics, this is a reasonable refresher. However, it is way too brief for the amount of material covered.",2
"Far too advanced for a total beginner as I am, was really hard and very confusing. My industry friends said it went too far for what I need in the real world",2
Very hard to follow and to understand if you don't have any mathematics background or statistic knowledge. But it is doable.,2
OK content but too slowly presentedpainful experience to go through all the lessons,2
"Despite of been a interesting course I find it really hard to pass it. In my opinion, previous knowledge or R should be required.",2
Very dry content and hard to retain any information presented in the course because of it. Quizzes are fairly easy to pass provided you have some programming experience.,2
"Very very difficult. Quizzes are quite easy to accomplish, but the practical ""take-away"" from each week is small. I would have preferred if the course focused on getting the results(data) and keeping the statistical analysis to a few (most common) areas.Too academic. More focus on practice use.",2
"This course is good but TOO FAR from the real content this specialisation look for (or at least, I was expecting).",2
too complicated,2
"Hello. Unfortunately- 2. Just my opinion - not enough information about R tests and program, what is this, basic details for testing and code, no details for Mac-users. Videos are to short to understand details and goals, what I will learn, how to use mathematic formulas? If I could - I wanna leave this course. Thanks for understanding.",2
expected so much more!,2
Its theoretical.No practical project to do,2
Not that helpful for me,2
"Again the content and presentation is great.But the web site is getting really annoying, especially in the assignment area. The editor is faulty and on the submission on visualization you cannot use visualizations(!) to make your point due to technical limitations (can't paste charts or screenshots).Sometimes verification does not work.Support is sometimes very good, sometimes useless, depends with whom you chat.",2
For a practice course I found that was full of theory,2
"I am not impressed with this course so far. The quizzes and assignments are out of order with the materials being presented - the questions on each come from readings and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course. The first module was a very, very basic outline of a generic analysis process, and really has nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular.",2
"Very basic course without much in depth explanations or insightful matter.I hope this course is worth the money i paid, I'm starting to regret paying for this.",2
"When going through the Theory course, I often wondered why the assignments are so abstract and theoretical, and I thought that maybe when we come to practice, we will be able to do something with our hands. No way! While reinforcing the theoretical background (mostly repeating same postulates from the Theory course), this course contributes very little to its name (practice). Only the last module on presenting goes a little further than making you ponder on abstract themes. This is surprising - there are lots of practical tools discussed in the course, and you have no opportunity to get hands on at least one of them (except Google Trends) and evaluate it, at least for primitive purposes. Why does the teacher not take the example of the brilliant Aric Rindfeisch's course Marketing in the Digital World with really well-crafted practical assignments?",2
"I appreciate this course and the instructor's time, but so far I haven't really learned anything.The structure of every lesson is:""1. Here are the 5 things we're going to cover. 2. Name (not explain) those 5 things. 3. Here are the 5 things we covered""I think there's a lot of potential for this course in the long run. I would advise having a professor from Illinois who is not in the business school take this course and get their feedback. I believe the instructor is very smart and experienced in this area, so this is definitely a course that could grow into a Coursera essential.",2
"Incredibly frustrated by the peer grading system. I've been able to work on the course at relatively fast pace and have now completed all of the lectures, readings, quizzes and test but can't go on to the next course because not enough people have submitted the homework for me to grade. I understand the advantage of being able to ""learn from others"" but it doesn't outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to work at one's own pace .",2
"Could be a useful course if you've never worked with IT projects, or for younger students. Everything seems to be about building a mobile phone app.",2
The course is good. But it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.,2
"Many mistakes in the slides and poorly defined problems in the assignments have gone uncorrected for over a year. The content is very basic, as would be for an introductory course, but can even serve as a refresher for CS graduates.",2
"This course is quite outdated. I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started. The Spark courses from edX are way better than these. Hopefully ""Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark"" from the ""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.Many of the videos, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over. They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... ""teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh...."". Gosh, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).",2
"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",2
"This course probably deserves 3-4 stars in a better, maintained form, but the entire specialization is not maintained, the lectures have no production values. Basically, it's a money pit that Coursera is keeping up cynically. It's a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists' skills.",2
"1. The title is misleading since ""at scale"" led people to think that large scale data processing platform such as spark and nosql databases will be central to the course right from the start2. The assignments need a lot of improvements. I am not happy with how we're often only required to submit a single number as an answer. The biggest problem is that this way the grader won't be able to give you meaningful feedback / hint of where you might be wrong. A grader that only tells you ""your answer is incorrect"" does little to help you learn from mistakes.3. I think assignment 2 can be paced differently - now it feels that we have a bunch of very easy parts (a-g) that is not very interesting, where the last three are significantly harder.",2
"The exercises are fun and challenging. However, the lecture are not related to the exercises and are very hard to follow (I think it's the same thing as Brian's class in Johns Hopkins' data science course) If you are taking Bill Howe's class, just go straight to those exercises and skip lectures.",2
"The grader is horrible leaving you with such brief error messages. You never know what is wrong with your code. The forum is not as useful as I expected nor as it is in other Coursera courses. You know, few classmates. The videos provide you with tons of information, but not much of them are well-organized. I often felt tired and confused since these long videos seldom got to the point.",2
"Good focus on ideas vs principles. The focus on relational algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general. Unfortunately, relational algebra is explained quite well, but not really applied after that. This could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in terms of relational algebra.Okay-ish explanations of databases and hadoop. Not very deep and not always structured, but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principles.I think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data science/mining/analytics courses suffer: it ignores the non-technical starting point: scientific or business relevance. How does one organise data, get to know completely new data, understand possible value? i.e. how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do 'something' with it.",2
"This course, which sounds promising in title and syllabus, has many glaring deficiencies. In fact, I feel terrible if anyone ponied up $100+ for it. It roughly covers some concepts of data science, but never at scale, and never very clearly. My background is a science Ph.D. with a lot of computational science experience.The lectures: Clearly poorly planned. Bill Howe has some knowledge about databases, but little skill in communicating it. The organizational structure leaves much to be desired. Much of the lectures are broad-brush and halting, simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times. Technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides, as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon. It's as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session. Phoning in it is an apt description.The Assignments: The first assignment with Twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course 2 stars instead of one. The lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though, so might as well just skip them and do it on your own. The SQL assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of SQL was ever given. The last assignment on Map-Reduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course. The autograder's idea of helpful feedback is similar to ""Incorrect value. Try again"" Week 4 of this course, which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at all.Overall, this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course. Do the twitter assignment and skip the rest. Lectures are poor and assignments are well below average. If I were at UW, this is not the kind of course I'd want representing my university in a public setting.",2
"This course left me with mixing feelings. I learned some new things, but overall I don't think that I got understanding of base concepts. Week 4 seems to have disproportionately more material than previous weeks, as though authors tried to Although free, this is course is also offered as a part of paid specialization, and I would be really disappointed if I'd spent money on a course like this.",2
"Outdated materials, theory is taught and then praxis is tested. Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory, or teach AND test praxis. I passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization I needed to pass the tests.Additionally, the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring.",2
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,2
very elementary. Takes approximately 2 hours to complete.cannot continue with the in-dept material but have to wait until next week (and payment ofcourse).,2
Overly academic,2
They could have stated the audience of the course more clearly. I found most of the information irrelevant that added little value. Most of the things discussed are generic and would apply to any project.,2
1-week does not seem enough for a Crash Course,2
"Good intent but poor execution. Tries to summarize all the major topics but ends up delivering a totally disjointed, cut-and-paste experience with no real flow.",2
Very short. Quality of the course is also not that good.,2
"Ref: ""A Crash Course in Data Science"" the content could be presented in a simpler way. Some of the presentations sounds little vague and conceptual level like an Advanced Math or, Statistics class. I am wondering since this is an Executive program, is there a simpler and easy to grasp way to present the material. The text download files (i.e. txt) document descriptions needs to be more clearer. The Power Point downloads are excellent and are to the point.",2
"too basic, the 4 courses of this specialization could be just one course.",2
"Too theoretical, e.g, comparison between statistics and ML is not at all useful. Too many quizzes after very short classes and on topics of absolutely generic things.",2
Very general course. Doesn't give much insight into data science.,2
Very shallow,2
This course is too short.,2
"The course is very much focused in the method of DCF, but there is a lack of information regarding how to apply it to startups in practice.",2
Not enough information on how to approach the final project. The project itself is very time consuming with lots of self learning and unclear specifications.,2
"The course has nearly nothing to do with the previous themes. I already have had enough knowledge, but as there is no support by the team it seems to be rather time consuming for others.",2
"Of all the offerings in the specialization, this one felt like it was thrown together in less than hour. I expected to have to learn quite a bit of material on my own, but even the references to additional materials were very thin.I could have saved many days if more guidance on the project workflow would have been given. The pre-processing of the data was quite extensive (9 steps before generating the ngram tables I used in my model) and was the key to getting decent results IMHO, but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this out.The problem was an interesting one and I ended up reworking it after passing with 95% (the only class in the specialization I didn't get 100% on) because I didn't have time to implement much of what I had to figure out by 'hard-knocks'",2
I hope it will involve statistics analysis in the capstone project. It is kind of bias to apply NLP knowledge and develop data product in the capstone project.,2
"Unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program, which is a shame. Ideally, the project was more related to quantitative data, or have compulsory module NPL. It was certainly a very important learning, but very stressful to have to grasp NPL and do the project in a short time.Learning NPL in short time in a DIY way without any help it was very negative and stressful.",2
"The capstone project doesn't fully utilise d knowledge from earlier modules such as Machine Learning, statistical analysis, regression models n etc.",2
Very disappointed with this final course. Little to no support. Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing techniques if you have never taken any class about it.My recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basics and then have the Capstone.,2
The course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.SwiftKey engineers are nowhere to be seen.There is no guidance.,2
"The explanations are not clear. The course is very theoretical, there's just one obligatory programming task. It's one of the worst courses I have ever enrolled in.",2
"Really disappointing. The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality (that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1)... but the course itself is bad: it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself (and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks)... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.",2
"Mr. Campbell's presentations are quite boring and consist of a handful of phrases repeated over and over again. The subjects are treated very superficially and the presentation style is confusing. I recommend to other students to read the Wikipedia articles about the subjects instead. Several times it feels like Mr. Campbell has never before seen the slides he is reading from and he is simply inventing stuff. Some information presented is plain wrong. Also, there is repeated talk of practical exercises to come, but that never happens. To Mr. Campbell's presentations, I would only award ONE STAR.On the other hand I really liked the presentations from Mr. Farivar. He obviously knows what he is talking about and presents the material in a clear and understandable way. He should take over the whole course and let Mr. Campbell do some research back in his office. I would award 4.5 STARS to Mr. Farivar.The homeworks of this course are simply checking for a very basic understanding of the topics. E.g. ""To do this and that, would you use technology A, B, or C?"" Where the answer are some quite different technologies.The course needs more involvement of the students by going more in-depth and adding some practical exercises.Had the cloud computing specialization started with this course, I would probably have aborted it.",2
"Interresting, but too easy to understand. Not much details. Very easy course, but you won't learn a lot.",2
It tries to cover a lot of ground. Lack of some practical tasks.,2
"Coming out from two very good predecessors (C3, parts 1&2), this course is somewhat a disappointment. The contents are too broad without real focused depth, and too much time spent on background info in almost all lectures. There ought to be more hands-on practices, and the assessments should be more challenging towards understanding, rather than matching terms.",2
"This course is neither high level nor low level. After having taking Cloud Computing Concepts Part I and 2 (which were excellent), I expected a continuation of the very deep level of technical material. This course doesn't do this. Instead it is sort of much higher level except that the instructor fails to stay at the high level and will suddenly go deep - but without providing the detail so that someone to whom this is new will be totally lost. Given that I was expecting the technical depth of CCC parts 1 and 2, I already had much of the knowledge that was presented and could figure out what the instructor was trying to present, but I felt bad for someone who wasn't already familiar with the material. It is my opinion that the course needs to be taken offline and redone.Note: Apparently I took a prior version of CCC parts 1 and 2 so my comments on those two courses may or may not apply anymore.",2
There is no one participating or collaborating here! There's no way to get help.,2
"The course contents are pretty good, but the suggested time to complete each week's assignment is misleading. I spent on average 2 hours for each assignment that suggested 10 mins to complete. I end up spending way to much time on this course than I planned to.",2
"The course focused so much in interacting with images instead of the HTML, CSS and JS subjects",2
"bad explanations, nothing you can do at exams without researching from external sources.",2
"I really enjoyed the first two weeks. When it came to JavaScript I couldn't follow, so much information was missing and lessons were not clear anymore. I understand that the goal was to teach the most in a short time but this was not the right approach.",2
"I'm confused as to why there was so much emphasis on domain knowledge rather than a good, solid foundation of basic principles. I'm also failing to see how much of this is going to be applicable to future installments of this course. As a starter for a Java course I am worried.",2
"Speaking of beginner level it is good until you are learning css in it . but as java script starts this course becomes a headache , not because javascript is difficult but they made it difficult . instead of going with basics they teach you to manipulate images . which is not every one's interest field . they should improve their javascript course . other than that it is ok .",2
"showed me 4 videos and no course instruction, am bummed really wants to take the course",2
"No consistency, from very easy web design fundamentals to advanced Javascript with no explanation videos to help over a series of quizzes and assignments in week 3 lesson 3.",2
"All the modules but last are really interesting and informative. The last week's module is very poorly explained, a beginner cannot really understand it.",2
Good course but I dont like how you have to finish each module within a week it would be better if you could finish everything in fourweeks,2
"The course is a bit of a show. Maybe that's good for teenagers and Millennials, but not for me.",2
"I was very disappointed in this course which held much promise. Too much of it has to do with the changing of colours. I got bogged down by hex colour requirements and other ancillary requirements. I did not want to learn such things. I wanted to learn the methodologies of programming and how the statements in HTML, CSS and Javascript interact. All of these areas were only touched on in very minor ways and with little learned. I got more out of the books I borrowed from the library in the same timeframe.",2
"okay for an intro, not the most boring content. It is a bit aweful that the insist on you using their libraries and programming environments. You spend perhaps 20% of your actually practicing coding, and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again",2
"Very very basic course. Learned about HTML ,CSS in initial classes. Then it was completely JavaScript. But there was no details about how to use JavaScript for web programming. Projects and Quizzes are kind of ok difficulty.I will recommend this course for the people who are not aware of programming.",2
very poor content on Java Script. If you just started JS do not take this course. It will be too hard.,2
"First two weeks of the course were ok, but after that it became something like JavaScript clap-trap, oriented to playing with images. I wanted to know how to make web-pages, I didn't get that information from this course.",2
The lecturers are speaking very fast. Some times at the code practice it is not understandable how to solve the problem.,2
Final assignment is too difficult to do for beginners. It's crucial for them not to pass the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment.,2
"This course is the first course in the Courser's Java Programming specialization, however, it uses JavaScript to teach high level programming concepts. If you want to learn JavaScript, this course is not for you. If you want to learn Java, this course is not for you.The course mainly solves image manipulation problems with Duke's proprietary JavaScript IDE. All the details are ""black boxed"" so you can't see what's in the JavaScript functions. I believe this is the wrong way to teach newbies because too much abstraction is never good.Also, as a man, I was personally offended by Professor Susan Rodger saying she wanted to see more women in programming. More woman means less men and that is sexist. As a supporter of equal opportunity, Duke University should take disciplinary action against Professor Rodger. I will not financially support any University that allows it's faculty to express inappropriate personal ideology in a classroom setting.I do not recommend this course, or any course with Professor Susan Rodger.",2
"HTML and CSS were GREAT. JavaScript was very confusing as it did not teach me what each part of the code meant, including the syntax --- and hence I was unable to understand anything by Week 4, despite having listened to all the lectures and participated in the all the activities. I wish JavaScript's structure was more consistent with that of HTML and CSS.",2
"Waaay too basic and simple for a comprehensive principles course. One or two concepts is not enough to gain an understanding. The power behind online learning is that if it takes you three views to understand it all, you have the luxury. Please beef up the videos and the assignments. The assignments had no feedback mechanism so I could easily plow through them without any knowledge of whether I did them right.",2
"Actually it's rather hard to understand how JavaScript works if you'd never learnt it before this course. And all this comments like ""write a programm before start the quiz"" hold me up to ridicule, because as a beginner I don't understand logic of writing.HTML & CSS are simple, so there's no problem here.",2
"I's not exactly class for the beginners. First half covers HTML and CSS and quite understandable and easy. Although, it might also help that I had class completely on HTML and CSS in the past, so I actually know what to do to write necessary code. The second part is on JavaScript. And here is where problem starts (at least for me). I didn't take JavaScript class in the past and it was all new for me. Professors try to explain it in few lectures 10-15 minutes each and then they expect you to write couple of programs and to make some project from scratch in few days. Sorry, maybe it's just me, but I got to have much more then about an hour of explanation to do so. I would highly recommend anyone who is new to JavaScript to take JavaScript class first and then to start this one. And no, I'm not new to programming.",2
"This course is just definitions... and the next one as well. I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions), but I will check another course that is not so academic.",2
Very rushed presentation. Blows right through a lot of fundamental concepts without a deep enough explanation or enough practice material (especially in the last two weeks). I feel like completing this class will require supplementation with better instruction.,2
"This course is very short. I've completed it in about 4 hours. Nothing was told about linear algebra, statistics, optimization. It is not enough even to learn Data Science.",2
Difficult content not explained well by the presenters.,2
Too basic. Should give an example on how these math skills are used in data science.,2
Very basic course... probably won't teach you a lot of new things,2
The grader functionality is bullshit. Working code needs to be fitted to the way its excepted to be.,2
I was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course. For one thing it tries to cover far too much material in 4 weeks. Within the limited scope of the beta test I started the node red stuff. It looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.A much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.The lectures on the Rasberry Pi were a joke. In order to do the course within 4 weeks I would have had to order a Rasberry Pi before getting to these lectures. A clear guide to course prerequisites and the Rasberry Pi and Sensehat must be provided.Neither of the tutors seem very happy about their job. This is a small point and not a show stopper.Overall - don't issue this course without major revisions (perhaps a new course team).,2
All it's about visual design. I was expecting more deep on tableau usage.,2
"No Feedback from quizes, it doesn't even show you what you have answered, makes it very tedious to study the material. I like the questions during the video, that is an addition that ought to be used more often, because it forces you to remember and learn faster.",2
"I did not enjoy this one. I find it too politically charged as it emphasized the ""visual diversity"" (religion, ethnicity) over the ""second-order diversity"" (diversity of professional profiles and personalities) which should be the focus of a management course.",2
"The content of the course is extremely useful, however assignments need review as the exercises results have mistakes and they are not explained very well (missing step by step guidance).",2
"Unfortunately, the content of the course is poor. Too many interviews and some of them are pointless.",2
"The content is too basic, and both lectures are too boring.",2
"This course is not well designed, there are multiple mistakes in the videos, assignments, etc. The content is covered after you already had to apply it in an assignment in a previous lesson. The tests are also not well made. The instructions to peer-reviewed assignments are not clear and will not bring you to the correct result which is shown during peer review. No involvement from the faculty, no one to answer questions.",2
The capstone topic was not very interesting.,2
A bit difficult in terms or using very complicated words....,2
Some of the algorithms are pretty cool but overall the course is not worth it. The material is pretty weak.,2
The course is for people having advanced knowledge in embedded architecture and knowledge. Until 3rd week is perfectly alright. But from 4th week the course changes to advanced knowledge. I do not think an intermediate could easily grasp enough knowledge from the 4th week. Kindly do the needful to change it.,2
"The course is a shallow introduction to a set of topics about embedded systems, it tries to cover too much without really explaining the concepts. The videos could have some diagram.",2
"I found this course to be dry. No practical examples. Just information presentation, like reading from a book. The lectures do not prepare you very well for the Quizzes and even less for the assignments. This is the only course in Coursera that really got me disappointed. Since there are not many students in this course one might feel a bit ""left alone"".",2
"Main issues I encountered in the course:- many videos end with a suggestion to ""refer to the suggested materials for more information"". Which are these materials, and where can they be found?- the slides could use some diagrams here and there, as the constant text screens are monotonous and make understanding harder in some cases- the course does not settle on a balance between breadth and depth of information. Some aspects are presented at a very high level, yet using very specialised terminology and concepts. For instance, context switching when describing the disadvantages of microkernels, or pre-emptively scheduled systems - I have a CS background and had no problem with these aspects, but I am aware I am highly subjective. It's a case of ""chicken and egg"", where if you understand the low level concepts you probably don't need the course, and if you don't understand them you also can't understand the high level concepts.- At the end of the Week 3 videos describing the three OSs, it is said ""In order to know the details on how to write a program and run applications in Riot/Contiki/TinyOS, please come back to our lectures who have more detailed videos.""Which lectures are these, and where can they be found?- the only practical exercises in the course (Week 4) are only vaguely related to the course's targets-----All this being said, it is an ok introduction to the embedded OS world, if you bring your own CS and OS background knowledge.",2
"The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented. I feel like I learned a lot. However, the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level, and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures. I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material, but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme. If others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory, I would not recommend this course.",2
"This was fun as a refresher course. If you're brand new to music theory, this course won't help much unless you spend a lot of extra time learning the concepts using secondary materials, google, youtube, and your own keyboard.",2
"The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening. For an institution like the host institution, this is odd. I liked the course, but it was not very well organized. Seems like it was for experienced musicians, eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well. Good Course, badly organized.",2
"This course does not do a good job at teaching the material. The lecture videos gloss over the topics briefly, but do not give a thorough explanation of the core topics of the course. The quizzes will repeatedly test on terms not even remotely mentioned in any of the course materials.",2
"could offer and cover much more subjects.spend too much time on basics, less on advanced.could have chosen better music examples.",2
This is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous Coursera courses I have followed. Some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail. It also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches I did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician I wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what I do and hear. Very disappointed - I will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning.,2
"I enjoyed the videos, but not the assignments. I wanted to have fun and learn more about the music that I think makes life more beautiful. The final assignment in the module was unclear to me and the feedback unkind. Telling me to wait a year, get outside help and try again is not in any manner fun or helpful. I can't imagine doing that to a student of mine, a peer, or even a stranger. Nor do I find it in keeping with the claim this should be fun. In the end I would rather be an uninformed lover of music than make myself crazy trying to learn it with people that are taking an introduction class and clearly forgot what it was like to be in your first couple of months of learning music. It is like learning calculus from the math instructor that thinks some of the steps are so obvious that he can skip them forgetting he has a PhD in math.",2
"Some lectures were quite interesting but the generel course level is very low. Furthermore, I think several topics is missing which I believed the course would cover like GLP Tox, CMC, IND filing and the topics which are covered should be covered in more depth.",2
too much speciific details that make the course difficult to understanding.,2
"Most of this course felt inconsequential, unhelpful, and not worth the money. I'd condense some of the commonsense aspects into other sections of the course and eliminate the 20-40 minutes of filler videos.",2
"I took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of SM or untrue. First, the the ""prof"" who talked about visuals OVERPLAYED the role of visuals online. The Internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc). The rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution. Words are still key online--are there ANY websites major who do not use words? In fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content. Second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many SM communities. As an INFLUENCER who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade ""to help them understand something"" (etc) I can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately. We are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community). I contacted a friend who's an influencer in different communities to me, with what your ""expert"" suggested. He, too, was not happy with what was in this unit. If you want to know why marketers have a bad rep? It's because of bad advice given in webinars like this one. I am so glad I did not pay for this course.",2
Nowhere near as useful as the first two courses. The assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials.,2
"This class is far too theoretical and abstract. You only have to get 50% to pass the quizzes, which indicates how difficult it is to understand the material.",2
"The exercises are not very interesting. The exercises initially focusses on identifying a leader who we have worked with but It should also focus on how am I as a leader, what is my level of emotional intelligence, how do I scale up basis some test etc. I lost interest in the course because it was more about seeing some one else as a leader than myself.There is a lot of research into the course yet it is too theoretical & not put in precise & interesting manner. The module needs to be shorter.",2
Not very motivating way of talking about the topic. Also it's getting old. He's lecture is sometimes colored like a stereotypical Texan. His extrapolations as flawed as those of the EIA. (Which by now can be seen with hindsight),2
"Course material providing out-dated concepts. Argumentation throughout the course is shallow, many of the the current arguments are not mentioned - from both sides of the energy lobby (fossil & renewables).",2
Very basic info suited for highschool students. Many errors in transcripts that you will just have to slog through.,2
"First of all, thank you for the course, as it enables students to get a bit more up-to-date and knowledgeable in the topic.On the other hand, unfortunately it's not worth one's time as it didn't deliver very good quality, nor on its promise regarding ""The Big Picture"".Pros:Easy to understand.Self-paced.Objectivity and positive overall message.Cons:Overall quality and clarity of the lectures is not very good. Lectures are a bit hard to follow, not because of the complexity of the topic, but because of some controversial and outdated data, and the speaking and presentation style of the lecturer.Assignments contain too many trivial questions, but also some mistakes which makes some questions impossible to answer correctly, based on the lectures, or at all.No staff engagement or feedback on the forums, which is especially problematic regarding to aforementioned mistakes.The title and description of the course don't inform students that it is completely US-centric, and mostly concentrating on petroleum/oil. So along with a lot of important topics, ""The Big Picture"" is missing.",2
"I liked the practice with Python. However, some of the code was outdated and didn't work properly. The course is abandoned. No one reacts on the forum any more.The instructor occasional made mistakes or was repetitive. Sometimes I wondered if Tucker was really knowledgeable about the domain that he tried to teach in this course.I'd only recommend this course if want to learn about CAPM, Sharpe ratio, and 'event profiling'.",2
Very superficial and too few insights. Could have been delivered in 1 hour. Probably ok for people with no knowledge at all in IT or Finance,2
"I like Mr Balch but to be honest I learned next to nothing. Maybe this is a good course for somebody who has no background in finance. As for myself I felt that I was wasting time and money. The book associated with this course was just like the course itself: shallow and doesn't go in any depth to explain the matter fully and rigorously. If you want to know WHAT computational investing is, you can take this class. Googling a bit will have roughly the same effect, though. If you want to learn how to actually DO computational investing, do not take this course - its just not serious enough.As the name of this course implies, you probably expected to find part II somewhere, which was promised to be a course about using machine learning in investing. 3 or 4 years after part I went live, part II is still missing and probably will never come out.The software used in this course, QSTK, is buggy and has been so for 3+ years. Its not maintained by anyone, and the people taking this course had to find ways to overcome QSTK bugs to be able to complete their assignments.And lastly: the exercises. There are none. All you get is a lame quiz for every week which basically asks to change some variables in the scripts provided. I did some coding for week 3 but that was it. No coding practice after that.",2
"Although this course holds quite a lot of information, it is quite slow in the way the information is transmitted and unfortunately, the presenter did not 'made homework' in terms of preparing what to say. In addition to the lagging of 'so, anyways, uhmm...' or just silence, many of the videos are also quite low in quality - especially sound due to bad microphone.Overall the information was interesting and useful, and I'm looking for Part II.",2
"The Virtual Machine Experiment was very difficult to implement because the instructors' format did not allowenough detailed instruction specific to each OS platform. Regardless, students did learn how to use VM-Ware to make a virtual cloud on a home network and control it via smartphone.",2
"Pace was slow and I was disappointed by the content level. From the title I thought this would give information about the ""global energy business"" but the focus is generally on the US, except for portions that discussed location/ use of global resources and demand and supply levels globally. The class begins with analyzing Supply & Demand curves for energy use and production which was interesting to me and I thought meant we'd be taking an economic view throughout. Then the large middle section covers very basic info about the types of energy production (coal, oil, NG, renewables) in the world -- low in factual content considering the time spent on each topic. The final section about political considerations was very basic and only focused on the US. I am amazed that the 3 branches of US government were explained on the simplest level; this is a middle school & high school topic in the US. I expected a more in-depth class with details and analysis about the global energy business. I am glad I did not choose to pay for the certificate.",2
"One thing I regret from this course is the content of the video lectures. Having watch the first week's videos, I found that the professor mostly just read the slides - and did it in a very faithful and careful manner, not to miss a subscript .... This is quite devastating for me. I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small). What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first week's videos add up to a mere 36 minutes. A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level. That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week. Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didn't read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time. That approach really helped scaffold my learning.I hope you'd consider revisiting this course's learning plan - or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one.",2
"She didn't seem interested at all in what she was teaching. She had a frown the entire time. Maybe she was trying to be professional? Either way, I didn't feel like she liked what she was doing.These were good tips for people in a new business management position, but honestly this was all stuff you learn while socializing with people. They are generally good social skills that every one should have. I learned little to nothing while taking this class. But, as I said, most of this is directed towards to someone in a management position. I guess this would be helpful when having to work with someone who is a drama-maker, although, fortunately, I have not had a situation yet with someone who creates drama. Yes, I know people who create drama, however, there have been no blowouts or severe problems. Maybe this is the reason why I didn't learn anything in this class... :-(",2
The course is good but very basic. Suggested for individuals who have never had any exposure to information on conflict or humanities,2
Hard to follow for non-native speakers. Especially week 2. There are a lot better Courses on Entrepreneurship on Coursera. Especially the Technion ones.,2
"content 4, thx!delivery 2interaction 0TOTAL (average) : 2",2
too brief to learn,2
too bored,2
"personally speaking, the contents are not helpful. and the multiple-choice quizzes stuck me a lot.",2
"75% of the course is amazing, the rest needs some work. The course feels as if its target population is lower-level undergraduates or the general population. Would love to see more advanced graduate level content included.",2
Feedback for the developed business model is missing and thus sigificant added-value cannot be captured.,2
"The format with a large variety of testimonials from experts in different niches of the healthcare sector was interesting. However, it lacked critical reflection and depth. Throughout the course, with only a few exceptions, I lacked the feeling I was learning something.",2
"I am a little disapointed with this course. I have completed the third week, but quizes are too big, and the questions are almost impossible to compare with the lectures.It seems like what is evaluated is your ability of getting languages nuances, and not the epidemiology subject.",2
poorly done,2
"The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before. I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that.The reason I am ranking this 2 stars is that I felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult (or perhaps they had bugs). Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn't figure out what the correct answer was. Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared. I have taken multiple coursera classes (Astronomy, Astrobiology, Calculus) and these are by far the most difficult quizes I have encountered.",2
"Terribly difficult to engage with 10+ min lectures in every lesson, plus unorganized presentations and interviews making extracting important information difficult; the lack of organization in the interview videos (which are SUPER long) made it very difficult to extract significant information for the course and assignements. I will say that the research and academic readings made available in the course were exceptionally helpful and full of great information, i just wished that that information was presented in a more engaging and interesting way, sometimes more organized as well. Furthermore, much of the referenced material should be made accessible within the course rather than simply cited; it looks fascinating but from places like China, databases and websites with such relevant sources are often wholly inaccessible. Please include links or entire documents.",2
Pretty basic course with a lot of 'dead time' not really learning anything about Excel. Tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topics.,2
"Course lectures are good, but many quiz questions are out of syllabus. Sorry, I am not satisfied.",2
"The course can be informative, but the presentation needs some work. All of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a Power Point presentation to the viewer. The ""in class"" examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual class.In addition, the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited. In multiple videos, there were typos. In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide. When the revised slide was presented to the viewer, a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence. In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment. I have no problem paying for a good product. However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.",2
"Quite repetitious in covering basic graphing, and very shallow in regards of clustering, SVD and PCA.",2
"Clustering topic is covered superficially, too much time spend on employing ggplot graphs, not very useful since making graphs is straightforward on other software, like excel, once you aggregate datasets correctly. I had not found it very enriching as a course. I would merge this class within R-Programming section and call it Part 2 rather than categorizing into ""Exploratory Data Analysis"".",2
Course content and assignments were difficult to follow. Loads of statistical content along with high-level R content means it was probably the toughest of the 4 I have taken so far in the Coursetrack.,2
About plotting in R. Not about generating real insights from EDA.,2
"Alas, after only 10 minutes of the first video, I am reminded that this instructor does not gear his lectures to the true Beginners among us. He speaks much more for an audience of grad students. I do want to complete this Specialization, so I will try again perhaps after learning more - about statistics and R and who knows what else. I fought my way through the first three courses, but now I'm going to work smarter by finding other ways to acquire this knowledge. Then return to him; maybe. This course should be labelled Intermediate and Statistics should be listed as a prerequisite. (I think; since I don't know what it is that I don't know, I am making a guess as to the missing piece of the puzzle.)",2
"Very unprofessional, compared to other courses. It wasn't well organized.",2
The final project did not require use of the material in the course beyond the first week and a half. I did not take any quizzes or otherwise have my knowledge tested on the material in the second half of the course.,2
"Some parts of material is good quality, but some is bad - also some show bad practices in R. Extensively use swirl as assignments over self work. It is better to go through good tutorial over R base plotting system and ggplot2.",2
"some swirl tests (4,5) don't work because of parameter method in qplot function. This parameter is not realy existed in this function now",2
I wish I could at least read the assignments if not get reviews on them in the audited version.,2
Poor video and audio quality. Not worth the price.,2
"I have to say, I am disappointed in that I feel there is little to no interaction here between students and instructors/aides. Additionally, the assignments are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion. The instructors videos are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking! There is no way to view other's bodies of work and critiques are very vague, etc. This is photography... where is the photography from learners (other than the assignments)? Why is there no gallery here?",2
"The course touches the topic very lightly. There are transitioning economies around the globe in dire need of start ups and the overall entrepreneurship spirit of Silicon Valley. I wish the course had provided deeper knowledge on this particular subject, specially focused on The Americas.",2
Good overview of the EU but you cannot do the quizzes unless you pay.,2
"In my experience, this course has a huge gap. The lectures go through all manner of tools, commands, packages, etc. about cleaning. That's fine and probably necessary. It's like ""this is a hammer"", ""this is a saw"". That's fine and probably necessary. But then you get to the final project...All of the sudden you're plopped onto a construction site with your hammer and saw and a pile of wood and told to build a house. You've never built a house before and don't have the slightest idea where to begin.What's missing is some principles of ""tidy data construction"" in the lectures. When introduced to a new data set, what are some approaches to understanding that data? How do you develop a plan to build a tidy data set (i.e. how do you think about developing a plan, not looking for a step by step instruction set)?It's disappointing that the only way for someone new to data science, R, etc. to tackle the problem is to read someone's third party monologue about how to make your reviewers happy.",2
"This class needs more content, more explanation. It is clearly a very important aspect of Data Science, but the assignments were more complex than the given course content.",2
"This course is where the material starts to get difficult, and the learning materials fail to provide the structure needed. There absolutely HAS to be a better teaching method than ""reading the slides of bullet-ed text that I'm also showing"". No functional examples are provided in the lectures and the real learning content is linked out to web resources. You will have to Google your way through this class because the provided instruction will not contain answers to the quiz or exam questions. A real disappointment.I also think that Coursera knows this, because this was the first course where they ramped up the e-mail encouragement campaign. Their data must tell them this is where people fall off the specialization. Rather than addressing with marketing and messaging, they should encourage the instructors to improve the course.",2
"The only interesting part was dplyr. The rest was too confusing, with lots of lists and no explanations.",2
"The code for the final assignment is peer reviewed which doesn't make sense. It should be reviewed by either a TA or some kind of application than can verify what you've done. Also, the assignments were a bit of a leap from the video tutorials at times.",2
The video is simple and good.But the final project and some test are too hard based on material presented.Also staff's support are not good.,2
Too difficult practical exercises with the theorical background given. I know that hackers skill should be used but it is too much assumption in the projects!!,2
"It is somehow just an extension on R Programming course, with many unnecessary details that will be forgotten in a few days after the course.",2
The videos did not teach anything that was going to be on the quiz so it was like answering 5 questions at random using google. The lesson plans and project were very vague and too much time was spent trying to figure out what was even being asked.,2
"The class is getting stale. The instructors didn't respond to questions on the discussion forums about quiz items, the majority of assessment items seem to be available on Google and 50% of the peer reviewed assessment I checked used plagiarized solutions.",2
The course was a bit mixed in terms of its quality.,2
"I believe this course suffers from neglect. Rarely did I see any of the mentors participating in the group discussions even though there were plenty of questions. Furthermore, some of the quiz questons seemed incomplete or confusing. The project was no better. I feel like the course was recorded a few years ago, and not much done after that to fix flaws, even though they are probably well known. The material is useful, but it would be nice to have a set of notes or a text to go with the lectures. You will spend a lot of time searching the internet to compelte the assignments. Sometimes that is good, but other times a guide geared to the course would have been better.",2
"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",2
"The project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items. For example the project ""book"". You hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one. At best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it.",2
"Didn't really cover how to deal with messy data, e.g. if you need to join to datasets and have orphans, or you have no foreign keys between two datasets and you need to use fuzzy matching.Basic validation was also not covered (i.e. making sure that your data covers all that you expect).",2
This course lacks projects to implement the skills we learn.,2
"I would have given just one star except the swirl() assignments are actually very good. The videos are just a (poorly) narrated glossary. Topics I learned in another course were presented here in such I way I actually got confused. Can you imagine? my knowledge was actually worsened, not improved by thus course. (!!) // If the swirl() functions were made the centerpiece of the course, and the videos were described as just a narrated glossary, at least our expectations would be in line with reality. // Even so, I come to Coursera because I WANT to be taught by an instructor. If I'd wanted a curated list of tutorials so I could teach myself, I would have done that already. Anyone who pays for this should get their money back. NOT recommended for beginners. // I going to complete it because I'm stubborn that way, but it is an unpleasant experience for me and everyone within earshot as I have to vent my frustration often just to make it through. // After week 2 I resorted to just reading the pdf of the slides and stopped watching the videos. The videos added NOTHING to my understanding. More often than not they put me to sleep. And what's worse, the narrator mispronounces ""attribute"". There IS a difference. I atTRIbute certain ATtributes to native speakers who mispronounce important vocabulary.",2
Instructor reads lectures in monotonic voice. The lectures themselves are just a series of cases of some R functions usage with no basics of Why you need to clean the data or real cases with complete examples how and where to get your data and what steps you can do to make it useful.The course has a lot of links for tutorials in R. That's a plus.,2
"The most important benefit of this course is the fact that it exists. At present the course is mediocre to bad: its educational value is low: transcripts are disgusting, they are not proofread, omitted pats of sentences, inconsistent English, they almost completely obscure, disrupt the sense of the presentation. The course offers no slides. I see obvious negligence in preparation of many lectures (especially bad week three).The target audience for the course is professional biologist that are comparable with arithmetic and elementary algebra and can easily use an internet browser.The course contains numerous mistakes: in particular, the elementary formula Dr. Cecilia Lasser presented in her week 4 lecture on Differential Ultracentrifugation contains an error.The lectures presented by non-native English speakers are very difficult to understand because of poor & inconsistent English.Please, make the lecture slide available for your students.Please, arrange a forum giving a possibility to ask a questions and get understanding of the material that remains unclear.The lectures on electron microscopy were very good, - thank you, Johanna!The lectures on AFM was the only one that was just excellent, - Thank you, Dr. Shivani Sharma.Please, review the sequence of lectures: I think the week 5 material may be moved to week 3.",2
I wasn't as challenged as I thought I would be with the Capstone course.,2
boring assignments,2
More in-depth analysis would have been amazing.,2
"Very general content. Not as useful as I thought it would be, but maybe I should have read the introduction better:)",2
"First noticeable thing is that the instructor doesn't convey competence very well. He lacks the practical examples to explain the principles more efficiently. The result for me was that, although he chose not to go deep, the principles weren't as clear, memorable or relevant as I think they could have been.I did learn a few useful things of course, but it was a disappointment in general.",2
Pretty hard to Keep track but the content was good.I probably need to be a bit more focussed next time.,2
Please include exercises for computing the ratios and the valuation methods. In-video questions would have helped more. The quiz does not actually test the understanding of the topic in-depth. There can be some external readings suggested - resources that help us get more understanding on the subjects discussed.,2
The labs are not up to date and several things do not work as they should. I had to fix several of the provided scripts to finish them.,2
Great content but making the theory of ape or chimp the origin of humans as the corner of the course and intruduce it as a truth is very wrong and shameful.,2
Much trouble with freezing and no sound,2
"Did not go into enough detail, reiterated home cooking and spoil rate but did not get into specifics. Perhaps another class on what foods do what in your body would be beneficial.",2
"It is a kind of introduction course as it was mentioned on course info, however it is very basic.If there would be follow up courses about the same topic it is a good start, otherwise that is not a learning based lecture.Thank you for your understanding.Deniz Ozalp",2
"Useful information about nutrition, I would've loved to learn more about that. The part about home-cooking and how to reduce the health risks when cutting an onion where too superficial and unnecessary for me.",2
Very basic knowledge,2
This is a very basic course on food and nutrition. I would consider the majority of the content to be common sense. I would not recommend it if you already have an interest or general knowledge of nu,2
I'd learned more since I check Harvard Health Blog so often.,2
"This is ok if you know absolutely nothing about nutrition. Otherwise, it's basically information I'd expect to be relayed to kindergarteners.",2
"The very first lesson implies that sufficient quantities of micronutrients can't be obtained from a diet high in animal-based proteins and fats. In reality, organ meats and egg yolks are higher in micronutrients than many fruits and vegetables, and only small amounts of dark-colored veggies and fruits are required to balance a diet that already contains a variety of meats (as far as both species and cut). The body is also better able to synthesize glucose (or utilize ketones instead of glucose to fuel cell function) than to synthesize amino acids, which are more easily obtained in the correct amounts from animal sources. Plant-based diets work for some people, but if blood sugar levels, chronic inflammation and/or amino acid intake are issues that an individual needs to take into careful consideration, a high-fat, low-carb, diet with a variety of animal products is more likely to meet their needs.",2
"general and shallow, not very informative, could be inspirational for those haven't cooked in a long time. recipe are at the end of course.",2
"This is less of a university level course and more of a long infomercial for Michael Pollen books with a cooking show at the end.There is no interviews with nutritionists or scientists. In fact, there really isn't much here in the way of science at all.The cooking videos are fun with some good recipes.",2
Not much content,2
"The course is essentially a self-help guide focusing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health. This is certainly a message that many people need to hear.Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound. Let me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.Around 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley. He found them to be of exceptional health. Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2. Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.Instead of taking this course, watch Maya Adam's TEDx talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-crM) and browse the recommendations of the Weston A. Price Foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guidelines (http://www.westonaprice.org/wp-content/uploads/Healthy4LifeEnglish.pdf). If you still need a self-help guide to actually start cooking your own food then by all means, take this course. It'll only take you about an hour.",2
Too simplistic if you already have some knowledge about a healthy lifestyle,2
"Really very basic, anyone with an interest in the subject is likely to know most of this already. nicely presented though, good quality videos.",2
Not in depth enough,2
"They talked a little about LDL and HDL which is good.But the rest was just a summary of avoid processed foods, eat less and eat less meat and ways to do it. It is important, but I thought the course lacked science and it was very very short.",2
Very basic content. I am not sure that there was anything new for me in this course. I am born in France and I guess we learn this from our families.,2
Far too easy and far too basic for me. I would have hoped for a more in-depth and scientific look at food and nutrition.,2
The course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand. First time little disappointment by coursera.com,2
"Too qualitative, too much theory, narrative.Needs more specific examples of how numbers are manipulated for e.g. in financial statement fraud. Perhaps show real data on how outlier transactions are spotted.",2
"My issue with this course is the lack of depth. Most videos are shorter than 10 minutes, the instructors race through their bullet points without developing the ideas enough. The pace is frantic and the content is superficial. I understand the topic is massive, but that only leaves me baffled as to why there is room for 5 min videos in this course.",2
"The course could be improved by cutting the repetitive materials, avoiding the time-consuming drawing on the slides and be more precise on the wording.",2
"The professor just read the materials through all the modules, and the course was really boring. But, the content was quite updated that was the only good thing. Does not worth such a high payment.",2
The capstone project is interesting but requires far too much time compared to the other courses and to what is announced.,2
"This course is just definitions. I will finish the course, but I do not recommend it for someone who needs a technical approach. I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions). This course are pure lectures, no practice beyond open-ended questions. I wish it was a blend of lectures and practice. and not so purely academic.",2
Help on topics is very limited. Nothing more than instruction videos. Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments. There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions.,2
"Unfortunately, no tutors/instructors present to supervise the course, which made inconsistencies between course material (slides, videos) and solutions calculated for assignments horribly annoying to deal with, especially for someone like me new to the topic. Further, the solver addin (needed for the week 6 assignment) is not consistent across different excel versions and libre calc, which resulted in a whole lot of guesswork to pass this assignment. I'm sorry to say the course never came close to my expectations, despite the very interesting topic. Would not recommend.",2
"The teacher in the first few weeks is hard to follow; it sounds like he reads from a paper and he barely writes anything on the slides. It sounds like every sentence he says is crucial to understand, which is hard to follow. The other teacher does a much better job at this. The course would also greatly benefit with exercise material so you get a better feeling of calculating these things.",2
"I find far too theoretical, too dry; no examples, no exercise guidelines. It's almost having someone reading the slides to you. Still useful for someone like me that never done financial engineering, to find all the concepts in one place. Hence the two stars as oppose to one.",2
"course needs problems with explanations and/or better feedback on quizzes. there is no way to tell what error one has made - it could even be rounding. a student forum might be helpful, too.application of some formulas is not clear, leading to errors on quizzes. in some cases I have used external resources to give me a way to achieve the correct result",2
Low quality slides. Monotone lecturing style.,2
Too high level the course is.,2
"The course is well done and well structured, however it's too theoretical.",2
"outdated, and the guy is really hard to listen to for hours.",2
Too preliminary!,2
frankly so far this is the best in Career Success but still not well presented,2
"Course material is fine.But the instructor isn't the most inspiring. The course feels like the instructor is just reading off the presentations.Overall, just an average course",2
"As for information in course itself, it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course.But I highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes. It is not a real class, it is a video and it could be done much more accurately. There were many many boring moments, while management itself is not a boring discipline, it is very interesting.Anyway I am glad I participated in the course.",2
"Too simplistic and not enough real world examples. It was clear instructor regurgitated material directly off of the screen, offered zero highlights to real world experience or issues. Rather than wasting a couple hours listening to presentations, download the slides and read them yourself. Disappointing.",2
The course is highly theoretical. Only good for coming to know the terms that are in use in the industry and their meanings. Very little take away from a practical perspective. Some live example or a case study to be incorporated where the students can apply the principles first hand.,2
"This class was bizarre. Some of the content and lecturers was fantastic, but some lecturers were quite dull and some lectures and quizzes were poorly written and misleading. The class was also strangely designed and executed: the amount of content per week varied significantly; the vast majority of the content was in a very specific energy sector (biofuels) and other key sectors were almost entirely overlooked; it also seems like the content is already a few years old. It was more of a description of UCSD's research than of the ""future of the energy"".",2
Not really helpfull,2
I did not find this helpful for a complete beginner. I will try an alternative course!,2
Taking this course is like getting lost across a ton of different websites!,2
"I have some html/css background. I listened to the first Module and then part of the second module. For a intro level course to get a site up and running using Word Press, I feel like it is missing some key information. As a non-beginner I am finding this course frustrating and not likely to continue. There are definitely better courses out there.",2
So basically it cuts off. It's like it gives you part of the information and then drops off. They also speed through it much like my old math teacher in college whcih caused 73% of the class to drop. Now I'm in them mist of it Paid for blue host. Paid for my web name and it looks like I'm going to have to pay someone to finish it. So bascially what I got was a bunch of added on expenses and still no web site. I would not recommend this course.,2
"I normally struggle to give poor reviews to free online content, but there are so many glaring fundamental issues with the presentation and content of this course, that it I feel it's important to warn people not to waste their time with this course in it's current form.The mapping and planning lectures raise some good points, but the rest give only the most basic overview of the topic at hand, glossing over steps enough that you would probably learn just as much watching youtube, or looking around inside wordpress on your own. The delivery of the lectures needs a lot of work, with distracting, erratic pauses between words, and the sound frequently cutting out mid-word as they switch between slides. I found it difficult to make it through more than 15 minutes of content.I gave more than 1 star because the links underneath the slides contain some valuable information, so if you can be bothered trawling through the slides you can gleam some knowledge there.Hopefully the creators of the course take on board the many negative reviews and give a major overhaul to the course, to bring it in line with the quality of almost all other content on Coursera.",2
"1 out of 10.A waste of time. If I cannot participate in discussions, forums, submit assignments, or give reviews, I might as well watch youtube lectures.The course content was very poor as well. (this is based on the unpaid material)This course should be scrapped and not offered as an unpaid course. Its a classical case of bait and switch.",2
"This course lacks a level of professionalism. The splicing of the videos is bad, and for me actual video of how t",2
"The material in this course is well presented, though scarce at times. However it has its share of problems :-little to no interaction from TA's or mentors in the forums-the quizzes are often out of sync with the lectures-the final exam has severe problems with questions (form not content).In more detail, on the final exam, some of the questions don't even contain all the content to answer them. They can request multiple answers but have single question boxes and/or the reverse.",2
"great first week, I like Fran's First week video, with the puppets and very engaging interaction,the next following 3 weeks are total bummer, It does give some tips for character design (such as what is tangent, or some other design tips), but it feels like a bloated interview and not a class-like experience. Great first week, terrible following week",2
"there was 1 concept taught in the first lesson that of density. then it was loads of videos of other people drawing characters, not actually going through a design process. and then a few assignments designing a few characters . I was hoping to learn more about some of the principles of character design- wasnt blown away by this course wont be taking any more of these",2
I am very dissatisfied with how there was absolutely no outside help/feedback from instructors or mentors in the forums when clearly the final project was outside the scope of the material presented. In the future it would helpful if either the lectures were modified to be more helpful in completion of the final project or the final project to be reflected of material in the lectures. Either way I felt like I taught myself all of this material using web resources and got absolutely nothing for what I paid for.,2
"I am taking this course as a requirement for the Data Science Specialization. I appreciated the concept of learning a platform in which I could conduct bioinformatics, but I feel the course did not provide adequate guidance and information. The lectures were basically video workshops with a few gems of knowledge here and there. I am now at the end of the course but I feel like I learned nothing but a few steps to running an analysis or two ( which I could have done for free through the Galaxy website itself). More significantly, its not wholly clear to me why some of the processes were conducted, or what, explicitly, could be gleaned from the analyses. My expectations were that the lectures would be more in depth about the science behind the tools available, why you would use such tools, and when to use such tools. I think this course would have been perfect as primarily an intellectual course with a hands-on introduction towards the end.",2
"The course Info was too simple. While the explanation of Why Galaxy and what the idea behind it was great, the content taught by the videos was more than basic. All this I have learned by trial and error myself, and I completely missed the info of WHY using THIS tool and not others. About extra options we did not talk at all.Additionally, after all these easy lectures and quizzes we were left with the final assignment that was super-hard. The vidoes only prepared for 1/3 of the workflow asked for, and for the rest one was left alone with a tool that was suboptimally introduced. Furthermore, the galaxy instance was crashing regularly, making the convenient batch tool impossible to use.While I liked the idea of grading each other, it was too much work, as everybody got different answers, because of too hard questions. Therefore I spent quite some time on grading, which I did not expect",2
"The course material did not cover anything that we needed to complete the final exam. Although I learned a lot working on the final exam, I felt overly stressed & I had to self teach myself in order to get through it.",2
"I think this course might have been great if I did it like 5th or 6th in the certificate sequence. I think this course assumes you have a lot of knowledge about both biology and statistics that I do not have, nor will anyone else who has only taken the first intro course. Even after having submitted my final assignment and peer reviewing others, it is not clear whether or not I or any of my classmates used the correct methods to complete the assignment. A valid solution to the final project hasn't even been given to us as part of the course, so I'll never know whether or not I did it correctly.",2
"I have very mixed feelings after completing this course. I can hardly say I feel I have learned any valuable stuff, especially in contrast to the first course when I had a feeling ""I am growing with knowledge"".Here, I was able to follow lectures' instructions but I did not fully understand why I was doing this and that. I believe not enough foundation was given to make people use the Galaxy tools consciously. The final project was ridiculously far more difficult than what had been covered in the class. I truly believe in the idea of giving ambitious final projects, but I do not believe in the idea of giving the project that is by no means doable based on the course content. Very discouraging.",2
"Nice overview of Galaxy, but does not really provide enough information for a beginner to start using it without additional resources.",2
The lectures were very informative and clear. I had no problem giving the quizzes with the lectures. The project I had no clue where to begin. There has to be extra lectures included to guide the project. I hope they add some lectures as whatever lectures are currently available are,2
"This course is best for recent graduates. It covers the basics. Feedback from course participants is not very valuable unfortunately. People just don't have the time or the experience to give any substantial feedback. For a project-centered course, I would expect feedback on the project (your resume) to be important.A better course that covers the same topic in more detail is: Writing Winning Resumes and Cover Letters. I've taken 5 MOOCs on resume writing and this course is by far the best. Much better use of your time.",2
"Personally I don't recommend this course. I really need to learn data warehousing for my job and I have no problem with learning by doing. This course gave me basics, but the learning was very stiff. I think it's just to theoretical here.",2
"The course lectures were too sparse leading up to the final, very important assignment of learning to how to create an ETL package. More time and energy should have been spent on the technical aspects of the Pentaho Spoon program, rather than doing overviews of application pros and cons.",2
"Not enough implication from the instructors in the course. Students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.Peer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.That's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that.",2
"This course was full of issues related to the installation and use of Pentaho Pivot 4J and Data Integration. The professor's presence is resolving these issues was practically nonexistent. Coursera needs to do a much better job at insuring that their professors are offering a quality course and living up to the expectations of the students. In the case of this course and the professor, they failed miserably. In addition, it is practically impossible to get support from Coursera when an issue exists and in most cases when contact is made, the assistance is minimal. It is a shame as the platform is nicely designed and the course topics are very interesting. If you are considering taking this course, be forewarned that the majority of the support of problems/issues come from the community, not the Professor or Coursera. In addition, you are required to grade the assignments of your fellow students. This is not done by the professor.",2
Just read the ppt,2
It's a good topic. However the quality of the lectures are pretty low. In my opinion people could learn the topic more efficiently by reading Stewart's book.,2
"I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces. One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me. So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments. This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.The review is kind of about what you are looking to get out of these classes. If you just want to LEARN about UX and human centered design, then it's a 4-5 star course. But if you want to PRODUCE some great work that will help you land a job in the industry, it might not be for you.",2
Should go into more depth - esp with Visual Design.,2
why intro is so long?it becomes boring without any physical interpretation of knowledgecan't you take at least one design project or demomany things were said but very little went in head,2
"I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.Pros:- The instructor: he is a captivating person. It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting. So, he’s personality is makes the course less boring.Cons:- The course name: when I saw “design” in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on. But no, the “design” means “project”. So I think a better name would be “Principles of Game Project”. Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization. It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious. I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not. It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course. They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it. Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea you’ve been working on course. This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playable… And can be non digital? Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype? Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldn’t imagine the real game. I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something. In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback! One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20. Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20. So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course. But, if this is not your objective, do not waste your time.",2
"It appears the teacher doesn't take the necessary steps to polish content and tests, everything feels unstructured and ad-lib. Course videos don't seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and tests are based on highly subjective content, but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewers (i.e. forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving points arbitrarily).",2
The information is good but is going too fast and I don't feel I have learned much from it. I'm on week 3 and I'm still not sure of how to make my assignments in a proper way. The quizzes are very confusing too and sometimes I felt frustrated.,2
"While I really liked the first course I have massive problems with this course. The first 2 assignments, a high concept document and a story bible were doable.But a full GDD and a prototype on week 3 and 4? These aren't part-time tasks for a few days, these are full-time tasks for at least a full month each to do them properly from scratch. These assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate. And I'm saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming. For people that are taking this specialization without a focus on game design and/or without ideas... this course is going to be hell to finish in time.",2
Provided Unity scripts for projects don't work properly with newer versions of Unity. Quality of video recording is kind of crappy esp. audio. Most of the stuff learned in this course you'd be able to learn straight from the Unity tutorials anyway. Not recommended unless you absolutely need scheduled assignments in order to learn.,2
"This was much less about the development of games as it was an intro to Unity. Furthermore, the assignments weren't graded on a timely basis, which left very room to collaborate and refine. Overall, I felt like I learned to follow a few basic things about Unity, nothing more.",2
"No practical learning, use case basis discussion. All course material is just google provided document.",2
"Too sample , and I would expect more in detail.",2
very bad course but i have come to the point that it is ok for the beginers,2
Setting up the development environment is sadly dated. GitHub has changed and doesn't match the videos so any information delivered doesn't help get someone up and running. Videos run way to fast when someone is working between multiple windows to accomplish tasks. Update info in videos and course would have value. Expecting people to pay to update tech skills in unrealistic in todays competive environment when you are competing against other pla,2
"First part (HTML&CSS) are good, but JS is to fast and hard to follow for the beginners.",2
the Course content is great and the Tutor is doing a great job but I didn't like the fact that i'm forced to use Github to submit my assignments,2
"Absolutely not apropriate for very beginners. Lacks explanation of ""why"" through all the videos, simply giving you information to remember ""If you do this, this will happen"". Such a structure of explanations doesn't give freedom in the future to do something different, as you don't get a general understanding of what you do.Additionally, all course is tought in Mac. Some commands are different for windows, and they were not even mentioned in the videos! I did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in Google, trying to find how to do something, that supposed to be explained in the lesson.Overall, the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners.",2
"Nice, but very basic.",2
"Superinteresting subject, but since I did not have access to all the literature through the website I was not able to finish it unfortunatly",2
The video lectures are confusing and quizzes too,2
"If you want to know the array of options of the various tools in the Tuxedo suite (and don't want to read a manual), then this course is for you. I was hoping that there would be some conceptual grounding in what each tool was useful for, but that was not present at all.",2
"For a beginner, it is a fair start but definitely many things could have been better. The course does cover the main subject concepts in fair amount of depth and with decent rigor. The course videos are sometimes kind of less engaging. Many a times I felt my interest waning off. Many a times, the mathematical equations looked daunting. I think more focus should be put on including more number of real world examples and solving them within the videos.Also, the concept of three Professors for one course was hard to digest, which led to the whole course feeling discontinuous and disconnected at several instances.",2
There are better courses than this for example Yale Game Theory(YouTube) explanation is not good.,2
Very formal and difficult to follow. Not for beginners. Not recommended for pros.,2
i didn't really enjoy this course,2
You need to simplify it a little more,2
"Some questions in the quiz are not helpful for learning more about the topic. For example how does it help the learner to be able to answer, what question the shirt of the presenter has? Seriously?",2
"The content was potentially interesting but the delivery was slightly below expectations, in my opinion. The topics and discussion could be possibly a bit more factual and focused. It was quite difficult to go through transcripts of interviews because they were interrupted by the interviewer.",2
"Very baisc, and uninteresting",2
The professor is so slow I have to have him at 1.5x speed when listening to his lecture and am still falling asleep. I am very interested Special Theory of RElativity but I ll just get a book. Will be faster.,2
"This is a very basic course, not at all college level.",2
"The amount of information covered in this course is just right for a beginner. But it suffers because one, the lectures are boring and lifeless (can you imagine graphics design being BORING?), and two, the examples are UNINSPIRING. They could've done better than use the same circles, squares and triangles to explain various concepts! It's hard to get excited about a topic when the presentation is this dull. And did I mention the lecturer doesn't even look directly at the viewer? It's like they're looking at a monitor or camera on the side, so it's like he's talking to somebody else.So in summary, basic concepts and information are there, yes. And it's free so take it and check out the others in the series. It's just that execution could've been a lot better.",2
"This course does go over some of the basics of graphic design, but I expected it to be a lot more rigorous. The assignments are incredibly simple, and I think that there should be no optional assignments in the class. The reason I'm taking this class is because I have a hard time motivating myself to learn on my own, so I need something that will really push me. I only spent about an hour a week completing this course, and I believe that you can't learn something by only spending an hour a week on it. Also what's the point of having mentors if they don't engage with you? I know I could have contacted them if I had a question, but I didn't because it was so easy. I wouldn't mind getting feedback from a professional graphic designer though if they're available. Also seeing how many students misinterpret the assignments, it makes me nervous that they are the ones grading mine.",2
"""Let's try and draw a very basic, simple apple."" I had to stop watching this course there. Sorry, but this is less than ""fundamentals"". I'm trying a new course on graphic design now...",2
Too simple and boring,2
I joined to learn outstanding experience but ... disappointed,2
"The content of the course was actually very helpful, but the way the assignments are made took all my motivation away. They use an external tool where one has to enter the information for the assigments, at the end you get a PDF and then you have to copy paste that again into Coursera. The emails are often confusing and some assignements require you to do something each day for seven days in a row, but don't really warn you about that anywhere. So when you think that you have 3 days left to meet the deadline ... wrong, you should've started 4 days ago.This in combination with the ridiculously detailed instruction videos, which consist to 95% of a tutor reading aloud what is written on the assignment webpage. Chances are you get bored quickly and miss the one information that was NOT given on the assignment webpage.In total, it is very sad that this course started so great, but the technical and organizational problems reduced the motivation so much.",2
"I paid to get a certificate and did achieve good marks on the tests and assignments up to week 4 if memory serves. And still, I ""dropped out"" before the end of the course. Why?- the tests trip you on little bits of trivia, as opposed to assess your understanding of key concepts. Another course, “learning how to learn”, has the best tests in that regard;- the modules are too long. When you do this in addition to working, it becomes a chore;- the assignments: instructions are tedious & confusing. As for the assignment themselves, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was a test subject with data being gathered in the back. Not what I signed up (and paid) for.So it’s a pity and I do regret having had to stop attending this online class. I was attracted to the topic, I enjoyed the personality of the host, but all the above made it a chore.",2
This course is for people who are already relatively happy. Tasks are impossible for those who are not happy. Personally i couldn't define happines and couldn't remember anyone who i am grateful to,2
"Lots of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring. Number and length of videos in each week are too much while the ""practical"" information you get are not enough!",2
The professor talks too much about the website and his book! That doesn't make any sense!,2
It seemed this course was a teaser to get people to enroll in/pay money to join the dogcognition program at Duke. I realized this in week 2 and did not continue the course.,2
Videos kept cutting out either entirely or the sound would cut out. Made it very difficult to follow.,2
"While the topic is interesting, the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful. The slides have several mistakes and typos, which makes you doubt the whole course. The speakers are not engaging and it just looks like no effort was made in preparing this course. Additionally, the materials do not prepare you for the review, and on weeks 2 and 3 (the hardest) you don't have a chance to review the questions or correct your mistakes. The course really needs some improving!",2
Not enough materials in the video. Most of the info are in the reading.,2
"Lots of readings! Would have loved a more engaging format. Also found the content slightly ambiguous, you might have to do some trial and error and might be surprised at the answers in the quiz.",2
Basically not much content. The guest speaker uses unnecessarily weird examples in his talk.,2
"The subject matter is good, but the course does not adequately explain behavioral finance concepts. Most of the course consists of slide decks to read. There is a dearth of video content. I expected better quality from a course provided through Duke University.",2
"The course covers the basic foundations of behavioral finance, especially prospect theory and various cognitive biases that negatively influence our decision making in financial affairs.The topics covered are definitely very interesting and the lecturers frequently prove that they know what they are talking about and explain some topics in adequate depth and breadth.For a valuable Coursera course I am expecting that most of the material is covered with video lectures (otherwise I read a book on that matter) and I am expecting thought-through slides with clear definitions, clear practical examples and exercises, and the presentation of experimental proofs for the given statements.Regrettably, most of this course is comprised of simple slides with limited structuring, as definitions, exercises, and proofs are often intermingled. More importantly, only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lectures.Especially the last of the three-week course consist mostly of reading material from an external website.The exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what I have seen on Coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progress.In summary, smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic, but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course.",2
"The video lectures were good, the tests were almost a give away and the essays were an opportunity to practice what I learned from the lectures. My only BIGGEST disappointment is that the essays were evaluated by students like me. I received evaluations that doesn't tell me much or evaluations that doesn't make sense. If I only knew that this course was not an instructor supervised course, I would have been willing to pay extra money just to get a professional to assess my essay and provide me with feedback. At this point, I am disappointed that I decided to just watch the videos but skip the peer-reviewed essays and make the most of what I paid for.",2
"I have yet to have ANY of my essays reviewed, although I have finished every requirement of the course. I""m very disappointed. I hope that the directions given to me by the course attendants will correct this problem, however.",2
"I took the first class in this specialization. I liked that enough to enroll in the second class, however I did not realize that it was being taught by the same teacher. Nothing against her, she certainly taught the class and met the objectives, she just speaks too slow/articulates too precisely for me. Also, I was not aware that Coursera changed the auditing policy. As an auditor, I am no longer able to participate in the assignments or quizzes in this class. Without the ability to do the assignments and receive peer feedback, it seems pointless to continue the class. Furthermore, there was a problem with the practice exercises... You need to download an app to do the practice, which I did several times, but the lessons or assignments never worked. I sent notes to coursera about this with no reply. The low rating is primarily based on the fact that I could not do the practice assignments and that coursera took away the ability to complete assignments and take quizes.",2
I am learning a lot but I can not afford to pay.,2
"There is absolutely no supervision on this course. My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so, no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as 'late submission'. I have reviewed 7 papers (requirement of 3) and am shown as being deficient. It is as if I dropped into a void.I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution, questions or help.I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction.",2
"i think, this course content is a bit dependent on thought process..it changes with individuals",2
"While some of the materials are interesting in this course, it gives a very ""high school"" feel rather than providing help with college essay writing. It would be helpful to have this course more geared towards college academic writing and have more emphasis on developing ideas, finding resources to support ideas, synthesizing, paraphrasing and all the other skills useful for college academic writing.I assume most people who come to Coursera are above high school level. Some of the materials like the monkey example are a bit too childish and the sample articles can be too simple to be appropriate to learners at this level.",2
"I was really interested in this course and I think the information is useful. But I find it boring, it didn't get my attention.",2
"This course fell far below my expectations and failed to rise to the level I've expected in comparisons to other courses I've taken via Coursera. A few of the issues:-Very basic information. If you have any marketing and/or messaging experience you will most likely be bored by the course.- For a course that focuses on engagement, very little mixed media use.-Timing issues of informational slides (usually too short.)-As someone who is a paid adjunct I did not value paying for the course, only to discover I'd have to review other students' work.-As a professional I did not feel the need to be reviewed by others, or share (for free) any input. The course did allow me to just space through and then submit with no actual answer, but doing so does impact your final pass/fail.-I signed up with the intent to take all five courses. Fortunately, I planned on paying for one at a time. After a disappointing course one, I will not be taking the additional four.",2
"Very basic information. Could have been covered in full in a ten minute video. Not very useful, given the time and effort involved.",2
Some calc and formulas are not clear otherwise the course allowed to have a general overview on financial instruments and trades,2
"The material was interesting, but it lacked in sufficient practice resources for the mathematical portions. Also, instructor support / feedback to student questions was lacking. I found this course adequate if it was free, but not worth $79 for the amount of resources I was given to practice what we learned. This is highlighted by the fact that the weekly quizzes didn't show you the solution when you missed a question, so you were left guessing (instructors don't respond to student discussion questions) if the videos didn't address that specific question type.",2
"The course information is very interesting but covers the material too briefly. The topics were covered very quickly and not in very much depth. Quizzes often asked questions in a way that was not covered in the course material and were therefore quite difficult to figure out at times. I'm taking this course series to learn the material, not to be tricked of failed on a quiz. Also as this is a rather math-intensive subject, a more comprehensive review of the algebraic tools and skills required would be helpful. Lastly, there were many mistakes with grammar and spelling in the written portions. I know English isn't everyone's first language, but if we are paying for these educational materials then it doesn't look very professional for there to be glaring errors repeatedly throughout the material. It's not that difficult to have a native speaker proof-read before publishing (I would be happy to do this for you, any job openings?). Just some thoughts.",2
way too many peer reviewed assignments.,2
Very good course! All explanations are clear and too powerful for understanding.Two stars because all tests you can submit if purchase certificate.,2
It was a good course. But it doesn't worth the money. Paying $69 is just too much for this elementary course.,2
satisfactory,2
"The class itself is quite good. However you can not submit the Module Quiz without purchasing the certificate, which is quite annoying.",2
"In fact the course is fantastic. I'd say that is perfect, but it is not because requires payment to be assessment in the activities.",2
"I think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course. The students with very basic level of English have to study with advanced non-native speakers and with natives. The exercises can be too challenging for the first category, sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third.",2
Great and free.,2
"Poor visual communications, it should be better since it is the only way to follow the course.Should be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about.",2
"This course is pretty basic. As far as grammar goes, it really only covers tenses and parallel agreement. I'm also pretty there is more to punctuation than the semicolon and the comma, although I didn't realize how complicated comma placement could be!The professor talks like she's on tranquilizers and it's difficult to do peer reviews when 90% of the class apparently doesn't speak English as their first language.I learned some things, but this course should really be called ""How and when to use a comma"". Would anyone really pay money for this?",2
"Contents are interesting and useful, even if the course deals with few topics. I think it is too expensive! A good grammar book is cheaper and more complete.I would not enroll this course anymore.",2
"There was some interesting information in here, and I found a few things useful. That said, you have to sift through a lot of gimmicks to get to the parts of the lessons that actually matter.",2
Worse taught,2
"This course has valuable information, but it is ultimately political. The professors don't even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools: ""New Historians,"" whom Palestinians reference; and traditional historians, favored by most Israelis. Which version is followed here? The answer is a mix, without identification. This is not the same as ""balance,"" which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence. As others note, there is zero reading material. One wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sides--that is how divisive this topic is. The discussion forums are also poorly monitored, unlike other Coursera courses; which does not advance understanding.""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course. And contrary to expectations for an offering from Tel Aviv U., most Israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertions/omissions. For example, Israelis recall that Palestinian founding father Haj Amin al-Husseini was a Nazi agitator in Europe and bequeathed an anti-Jewish ideology (Netanyahu even made a speech about this in 2015 that was covered internationally). Yet in this course, you will be told simply that al-Husseini was a ""man of religion.""",2
The course was too short and did not provide any reading material.It would be more helpful to have more and shorter quizzes.,2
"I would not recommend this course to anyone interested in an introductory linguistics course. While I understood the content of the lectures, discussion videos, interviews, language informant videos, and required reading, the quizzes were far too difficult for a beginner course. I found myself wanting to drop the course, and the discussion forums show I am not alone in my frustrations throughout the six weeks.",2
"Interesting content, but issues with broken links needed to complete quizzes while they were due. Needs better explanation of how to use other resources. Many of the quiz questions are arbitrary, rather than really testing knowledge gained in the class. The lectures are still useful, and would recommend doing this as a free course, but see no use in paying for a certificate on completion of the course.",2
"The course was often confusing and the quizzes came down to a question of trial and error. I found this very frustrating. Although the topics were interesting, I didn't find them very well presented in spite of the enthusiasm of the lecturer. But there was a lot of ambiguity and bias and the inability to discuss except through the forums was off-putting.It wouild be good to know why answers were wrong in the quizzes particulalry when you had put a lot of effort into studying them.In the final exam, there are questions which are evidently wrong, both in their wording and in their marking and nothing has been done to remedy this in spite of the complaints in the discussion page.",2
"The course itself is fine. The quizzes, however, are so frustrating as to lower the enjoyment of the whole thing. Numerous answers are just factually wrong. You end up retaking the quiz time and again and then selecting random answers just to pass.",2
Very slow moving. Feels like you have to sit through a lot for very obvious information. I would recommend http://ielanguages.com/linguistics/ for a more detailed and more concise introduction.,2
"Platform tooling for emylators and native devices is tricky and if done wrong, it impacts a students ability to finish the course.However these topics get very little attention.",2
"While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didn't think this course was taught well. Much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching. I felt as though I was just copying and pasting sample code. At times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used. In most cases, I could have learned the Ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like. I'd have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any context.The quizzes are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation. I would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the ""put this code here"" approach that's used. The assignment grading is either far too obvious (whether a required module was injected or not) or completely arbitrary. Generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well. I didn't feel like I really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course.",2
Sells too much Google and do not explain important things.,2
"Good overview of all the services, but I could have read it just from the service list, and all the labs can be done without watching this course. There is no barely any information about machine learning, except for a small Tensorflow playground overview and copy pasting Python to Datalab. But this negative comment is only because I was expecting it to be a bit more comprehensive, for someone who has no previous information about any of the subjects, this can be a good introduction.",2
course starts to be already outdated,2
Time for an update.,2
Doesn't look quite helpful. Just some common things.,2
Too US focused.,2
"I was most excited about taking this class (in fact, it's how I found the specialization as a whole) and I did not get as much out of it as I was hoping for. :-\ I think that it's geared to too wide of an audience, so we didn't get as specific as I was anticipating. I also felt that a lot of the time of the videos were taken up by telling us what not to do. (""You don't want to be too far to this side, but you don't want to be too far to the other side, right?"") I did get some good information out of this class, but I found a disconnect between the lectures and the homework. When we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment, it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator pitches--what makes a good (or a bad) elevator pitch? What kind of things would be a good idea to include? Concrete examples would have been super helpful. Submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did vastly different stuff made me question my own submission (Did we just take it in a different direction or did I (or they) misunderstand the assignment?) but since we're all peer reviewing, it's a case of the blind leading the blind there. This also happened with the SWOT Document...which I don't think was even mentioned in the lectures at all in-depth. Again, it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples, as I've never heard of that document before.",2
"The course was very superficial, mostly with tips and hints.It's good to be aware that the option for performing the quizes and tasks were unavailable, making it hard to evaluate the experience of the course fully.",2
"This course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry. But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful. For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc. The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two 10-15 minutes long video lectures. Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.The quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all. Some of the ""correct"" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quiz.The third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes. However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics. Unless you are already in the industry, I do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience.",2
broad overview on,2
"Unlike the HTML course which precedes it, this course was lacking information and structure.",2
The lectures and assignments questions are more about the history of the internet and HTML. although I've finished the course but it wasn't as good as i thought.,2
"I signed up to learn how to write good code, but I don't feel like I learned much. I passed the exam by writing an HTML document that was syntactically and semantically correct, but I don't know why it was more correct than what I've been doing on my own and cannot be sure I'll will write better code in the future as a result. I did learn a lot about the internet in general though. I feel like I would have learned more and paid less money taking a course somewhere else or buying a book.",2
"More interactive assignments using the parser would have been great. As it stands, the quizzes had mostly relevant content, but the lessons were anything but engaging. Having Colleen talk at the camera for 5-12 minutes per video got tedious really quick.",2
Could be better spread out over a longer duration.,2
"The caliber of questions in the quizzes is quite advanced. I would be fine with that, as the challenge of writing correct html5 is a good challenge. However much of these questions were not covered in the lectures or the required and optional reading. Learning the correct html tag syntax is not intuitive--one has to be shown examples. If no examples have been covered, how can a quiz-taker be expected to create the proper tags? This strikes me as bad pedagogy.In order to answer the questions and prepare the requested page of html tags, it became necessary for a beginner such as me to research elsewhere in order to answer the questions. In that case, I began wondering why I was taking this course, rather than just reviewing the many free html5 explanations on the Internet.Further the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when I am simply told something isn't right and I should review the lessons--again. I expected better feedback.I found this course to be fascinating from the lecture point of view, but ""abusive"" in terms of quiz expectations. I was going to take the CSS3 course from the series, but now I plan on looking for this education elsewhere.",2
"This is absolutely NOT for beginners. There is no way you can possibly do this class in under 10 hours a week. The presentations are sloppy and vague. There is absolutely no support, unless you count snark from the aids who check into the message boards once and a while to tell you your question is stupid. This woman chatters on way to fast and if you use the slower speed setting on the videos, it crashes every time. I am not happy that I wasted money on this class. It offers nothing to prepare you to actually do any real life HTML coding. I highly recommend either purchasing a book to learn on your own or take a class elsewhere. The Coursera platform is garbage. The app crashes and it doesn't seem to cooperate well with Safari so I have to lug around my laptop in order to get through this nonsense.",2
If there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehow.What does that mean?- The lectures provided valuable information.- The quizzes generally made sense (in relation to the lectures).- Learning how to code wasn't really possible.Why is that?- There is only one programming assignment.- The autograder doesn't give any feedback at all why resp. where things go wrong. That's everything but good style (for software as well as for learning).- Code snippets can't be tested individually. That's very bad behavior in programming.- At the end working code that meets the teached rules is marked as wrong. You are lost without any clue.So probably you can learn something. Unfortunately you can't possibly finish the course with a feeling of success.,2
"The teacher is excellent.This is excellent but poor introduction to HTML.The course, which is part of specialization should be much more detailed. With much more axamples. I think it is not worth 49$.",2
Could have been more useful,2
"Thank you for you time and for everything you did.As an introduction, I did not find that there's need to talk about the hosting and the other things related to this topic. It would be better if the instructor went deeper into the HTML5.",2
This course was clearly not ready. The autograder for the final project was.. a complete fail. It was not a fun experience trying to change around my code to figure out what the autograder wanted.,2
clear teaching but too much basilar introduction,2
"The lectures get you through the basics in a clear, understandable way.But the auto-grader was really a bad idea, that got the lecturer into a lot of trouble for very little gain if any.It seems to me that peer-reviewed assessments, with proper instructions, are better suited. Apart from being more reliable and less frustrating, I think the learner can really get more out of it.",2
"It may be a 5 weeks course with a more slow learning, because we see some tags in a second and it passes. And the autograder works really bad. I do not know where I fail but I failed all the questions. A peer grader would be nice for the final project.",2
"While the visual set up is well thought out (you can see the instructor, slides and writing space, the setup of course materials is too stringent for the beginning chemist. More time seems to be needed focusing on the basics of chemistry and chemistry math (such as how to read CH4, sig figs, etc) prior to testing on stoichiometry.",2
"Quite a repetition of Fundamentals of Graphics Design, the first course in the specilization.",2
"Not up to the standard of the previous two courses. The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table. Even the assignments were a re-hash of the ones from the first course. I realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the ""making"" of multiple iterations of the images. I just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy.",2
I understand it was a more practical course but still more information would have been great. Same assignments but more information would have been great. Other courses had more videos.,2
I found the course videos quite dull and uninteresting. The topics covered could have been taught a lot better. I finished this course only because I wanted to get through the specialization course. I found that the course 'Fundamentals of Graphic Design' did an exponentially better job of explaining image making techniques and composition. The assignments in this course are reasonably good but the instruction videos can definitely benefit from some additional in-depth material.,2
Muy light,2
"Very basic, it's like reading the table of contents of a guidebook 'How to become an Entrepreneur'.",2
Few useful information.,2
Nothing really new. Very good for newbies in the field. Short and easy to handle presentations and topics.,2
Very basic overview. No real meat on these bones.,2
"Disappointing, not different from a class presentation, poor in content, lousy instructor",2
"foreign accent is totally ok, but very poor presentation skills by lecturer. material should be refreshed some already outdated",2
I do not feel that this course is ready for publication and is overlong for the material presented.,2
The content was fine but the delivery method and instructions were sub par. Hope they will improve it.,2
very basic information from high-school STEM classes,2
"In terms of how the course was presented, I liked it compared to the usual lecturing style; however, the content was below basic for someone in the field of health.",2
A solid reminder to all to be active. Good MOOC if you're just starting out and looking for basic guidance on where to start.,2
"The course is interesting and might be useful for complete strangers in the world of fitness/physical activity, as it provides some general ideas about implementing activity to one's daily life, as well as gives a good understanding on stating achievable goals. For those who have the essential knowledge of all that, the course would be a repetition of the basics. The most useful part seems to be about the goal setting, and that is what I'd recommend to start with for most students. The course won't be useful for fitness\sports professionals. Follow-up e-mails for many months after the course ends seem to start turning somewhat annoying. The quality on the videos (sound especially) is often a bit on the poor side.",2
"There was nothing in the course that I didn't already know, but I'm no longer young & I didn't expect there to be. I wasn't wild about sitting through lectures about being active while pregnant or making sure my kids exercise. For me, that's a waste of time. I know what I need to be doing & I was hoping the course would inspire me to do it. Unfortunately, it did not. I got tired of hearing about walking or bicycling to work as the main way to get active. I am now retired, but even when I worked that was never an option.",2
"Needs to be more concise.Nick seems very passionate and trying to reach a broad audience, but overly explaining topics is creating ""lecture fatigue"" for me. For instance, every video starts with ""welcome back... this is why people like this... [meat of the video]... this is what we just talked about.... see you next time"". I really just need the [meat of the video] part. These videos are 5-10 minutes long each. They are very short and therefore I do not need an introduction/closeout for each individual one. The Module Overview and Module Recap videos are sufficient to serve that purpose.Overall, I learned the basics and will probably take the next GIS course because I like the Coursera framework, but I think this particular course could be much more condensed.",2
Informative but did not really feel like it was of any use.,2
it was ok but 5ara,2
"While it is a great course for all beginners to the Guitar, the only problem that I see is the grading system that is absolute loony. It is left to other students to grade it and that may or may not show up to be graded by other students. If it is not shown up to be graded by other students then you are left grade-less for that assignment hence leaving you unable to complete this course and you cannot receive your certificate or completion letter.",2
"It seems more like a weekend lesson than a well prepared course, I mean, it looks that it had little preparation and too much improvisation, therefore, it should be a FREE (ar at least cheaper) certificate due the quite poor planning and execution.",2
The studiant do himself the teacher.,2
just started so tryen to get a hang of it ill rate better later if i like it but my minds tellen me that im going to be rating you guys 5 stars later in the futer,2
"This course is fun, but the instructor or course admins need to put more videos, contents and information to the course than just a few videos, few topics per week like this. The Global Diplomacy course should provide clearer and deeper about diplomacy than to pose what is diplomacy or what the diplomats do in their very actions of daily routines.",2
"Not as advanced as other Coursera courses, this course if for participants who do not have any background in international relations and diplomacy. Wish they would have made it more advanced.",2
"The lectures were not very interesting or instructive. The reading materials were much more so. However, the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self-reflection than on the materials. I learned a little bit, and as such found the course worth the time I put into it, but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials, and thus derive very little benefit from it. I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping.(In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials, I think more real-life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition.)",2
Bias towards the American healthcare system and deathly boring. Only take this course you have to.,2
There are some website errors. Also I think the videos could be better,2
"The algorithms presented in this course are interesting. However, the quizzes contain some questions that have no apparent relation to the content of the lectures, and some questions about details of the presented algorithms which are explained in neither the lectures, nor in the papers from which the lectures are derived. Also, most of the sample implementations will not run on a modern computer. They only work on Windows with Java 6 installed.",2
THE COURSE LACKS SUBSTANCE AND THE QUALITY OF A DANISH CENTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION,2
too simple,2
The videos did cover the basic theories behind all the methods for portfolio management however they were just basic theories with no explanation on how to practically implement them and then asking us who only understand the theories from the videos to suddenly try to solve the calculation quizzes especially those excel calculations without any practice on how to implement them beforehand. Besides the videos only showed the formulas with no example at all! Very disappointed with the course... This course is not recommended for those who have zero or little experience in the field..,2
"I am not connecting to the instructor at all. The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand. Further, my connection to the site is disturbing. In this and a couple of other courses, the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture. Between these two issues, I am not having a good experience with this course. I live in the US and have graduate degrees in public health .",2
"Very superficial teachings. This course seems aimed at non legal students, considering the very rare references to the legal instruments' articles. For the price paid, I could have found most information on Wikipedia... Furthermore, the staff isn't responding AT ALL to the —many—requests of the students regarding errors in the questionaries, deadline explanations, etc. Even worse, the subtitles to the videos are full of small typos and wrong transcriptions, sometimes changing the meaning of a sentence, thereby confusing the audience.",2
"Some good content. However, text has numerous spelling mistakes and there is no involvement by academic staff. Nor can one see one's answers to quizzes once done., nor standard answers provided. As with so many Coursera MOOC's, little involvement by fellow students in discussion fora. No certificate on completion, which is a pity because the cost of a purchased one is somewhat prohibitive for third world students with our exchange rates.",2
"Lecture quality is not as good as other sessions of the course. Plus the grading system is not upto the mark. People evaluating others performances, themselves don't know how they are suppose to evaluate. Grading must be done by Professor. All other ISB modules are far better on Course ERA, except this one. No offence, but it's true.",2
Do not recommend. Chaotic and full of irrelevant (IMO) information. Does it really matter in which year some paper was written? Or from which latin word the term 'interest rate' derives?,2
"The course seems more like a cut-and-paste version of Prof. Shiller's ""Financial Markets"" course from Yale Open Courses than a proper Coursera MOOC. While the course's content is interesting and benefits a lot from Prof. Shiller's extensive scholarship and insight, it could be improved along several ways:(i) downloadable slides giving a comprehensive overview over Prof. Shiller's key points and power point slides;(ii) a split screen with Prof. Shiller on the right and the slide on the left side (like in Metrick and Geithner's ""Global Financial Crisis"" MOOC);(iii) clearer presentation and explanation, especially concerning Mr. Redleaf, but also for Prof. Shiller (he rambles quite a bit).",2
Missing substantial amount of information and lecture,2
"The lectures' videos are available intergrally on youtube, whereas on Coursera there are some parts that are missing. The students' answer on the blog are not answered from Coursera staff",2
Not quite what I was expecting from a leading economist at Yale.,2
Topline introduction,2
"Good lectures, but no exercises or assignments. Leaves a flat and unrealistic image of the subject.",2
The course contents are covered too briefly to learn anything useful. Too much breadth and insufficient depth.,2
Too short.,2
Good content,2
"Not enough conversation on IoT (Just in the last module). Way too much time spent on history that really doesn't matter and on stuff I can find on the net. One Module to run through all of these - Circuit switching and packet switching, computer telephony (SS7) and then wireless would have been enough. The remaining modules should have gone into the concepts of IoT in greater detail and some high level technical info that someone who is just hearing about it can speak intelligently on it without having to develop my own dragon board (next course)",2
It is good but for an introduction its too long.,2
bad explanation and poor introduction,2
Too basic and not thorough enough. The assignments are too easy also because of over specific assignments instructions.,2
"This course is way too basic, so basic it doesn't even cover some of the essential basics, like explaining what the Box Model is in CSS. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because you can still learn SOMETHING with it if you are a complete newbie, but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional. There is a long road to go after you finish this course, which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthless.It also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice (like using DOM event attributes in the HTML). It is okay to present that to the students, but you should also mention that while they are there, it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practice.I have taken courses from other sites like Codeschools, Codecademy and Treehouse and left Coursera for later because I believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise, but so far I feel kind of disappointed with the Full Stack package.I am hoping it will get better with the next modules.",2
Very poor CSS content,2
"We are given inadequate information in the videos, and no other resources, to write a program. Required to use methods not covered in the course.",2
Unnecessary course for this kind of specialization...,2
"Gives you needed basics on HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the rest of the specialisation. However, could definitely expand the JS aspects a lot more. Explaining the type system, the prototype chain concepts, making us aware of what the language can and can not do. 1 to 2 more weeks would have been expected from this course.",2
"It is two hard for beginners, or the lectures should be more detailed because assignments are hard. And on the another hand there are two much information and lectures for one week. It should be less lectures and information for one week. In this way it has two much load for person who works. It should be stretched trough more then 3 week for example 6 weeks with less lecturers with assignments that are graduly get difficult. Because first assignment is to big jump.",2
Not happy with the quality of the material. Dropped the whole specialization halfway through this class.,2
Very basic and not especially much fun or challenging,2
"A good course, the methods and pace was not good enough. I wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything",2
The videos just gloss over the materials.... No comprehensive lecture notes or standard textbook and lessons are too squeezed.,2
"Hastily put together. Quickly steps over lots of material, some of it is out of order. There is an entire video in week three, that covers material needed to complete the assignment the week before, for example.",2
Cyber security is hardly covered in course. IoT as well is supporting product marketing. Coursera s losing it's quality..,2
"This is a great course if you have literally no idea what the 'Internet of Things' is, and if you find using a smartphone challenging.",2
"Sorry but although I found the topic of interest I found the delivery very dull. Yes, Prof Covach knows his stuff but basically what we got here was little more than a reading of text from his book. I know he explained why the actual music was not included but think he could have done more to provide links and stimulate listening. I eventually just started reading the transcribed text of the lectures as I did not find looking at Prof Covach's talking head at all stimulating. Prof Covach did nothing to stimulate discussion in the forums and although I posted a few things there was very little going on in the forums. I bought the book on the basis of being interested in the topic but it is not at all necessary for the course.",2
"Content is not excellent, the trainer is just reading a text while slides are passing trough the screen, no examples, no analogies, no explanation whatsoever, I wouldn't call that a training. I'm quite disappointed.",2
Questions are really stupid and predefined answers very unclear.,2
"The content is good, but the pace is too slow. Additionally the way the content is presented is very flat. I'd prefer a bit more passion and enthusiasm. All in all a decent course, but nothing that couldn't have been learnt just by browsing and playing around with GCP trial.",2
"Lectures are very monotonous-sounding. It would be better to make them sound more conversational (with pauses, questions etc.). Granted it cannot be interactive since it’s not a live classroom, but it can be made to somewhat sound like an interactive session...Some slides are too verbal. It would be better to have multiple small demos in a module for different slides/topics instead of just monotonically reading out the slides and then having one demo at the end.Too many lab issues. No one responded or addressed them. In a class with such a short span (1 week), it’s very important that everything works and any questions/concerns are immediately addressed/resolved.Please consider making the lab instructions available for download (say, as PDF files). This will be helpful for any later reference.",2
Headed downhill. Lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preperation... or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar (like textbooks). One of the instructors even said at one point they didn't have enough time. What does that even mean in an online course. You could be fixing it right now and improving the course. This whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy. On-line courses can undergo continual improvement. The college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now. Fail.,2
Way too basic. Probably only suitable for absolute beginners.,2
Should just be called 'Introduction of Java for absolute beginners'. I don't recall anything '...for Android' about the coding.Some of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that it's painful to listen to. I really expected better.,2
"This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor.",2
Very lengthy,2
"I am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the Android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way. I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done. Its a subtle form of style enforcement which I did not appreciate.",2
"There is a choice in assignments, you can do them either written or video. However the evaluation highly favors videos and it is not possible to pass te course without doing them. Course staff do not respond to this issue... Not very motivating...",2
"It seemed to me like an ad or Präsentation for this high school. It had some interesting thoughts in it, but not much information.",2
"All of the course material and talk is available on Google documentation, didn't get to learn anything otherwise. Zero experience talk, no real scenario's/examples. Not worthy at all.",2
tutor is Russian i guess her accent is not quite understandable,2
"Interactivity with JavaScript was too quick and short. JavaScript by nature is much more complicated than HTML5 and CSS3, and therefore I believe that it should be done in a bit more than 4 weeks, and broken down in to smaller bits of the basic info required to get a grasp on the materials. For example, the first assignment had too much in it for a beginner, and a bit more homework, in smaller bits of the code prior to the assignment could have make a huge difference for the better.",2
Unfortunately it's very poor material and lecturer is not expirienced yet enough :(,2
It was very hard for me to learn I am not good at javascript,2
"Please, change this course completely! Sure you need at least 5x more time to do a good course. The course is very fast and the lessons are not enoght to teach in a good way. bad bad course....",2
It seemed to move way to quickly without a good explanation of how to use the script. I learned a lot in HTML and CSS under this proff but not a lot from this course. I continue to review it and look up other resources.,2
Not for beginners unless ready to spend lots of extra hours watching the videos several times and surfing on the web to get additional information,2
"I thing this course should have one or two more modules. It's definitely to short to grasp the basics of JavaScript. For complete beginners it should start with a module about Foundations of Programming and after explain in depth what is a method, a property, an event, a calculation, a variable, an object, etc.... After I finished all the modules of this course, always coding along the lectures and having done all the assignments to practice and having read the extra material, by the end of this course I didn't had a solid foundation about how to program in JavaScript. So, if you enrolled the Web Design Specialization, after the HTML & CSS's courses you will have solid foundation about those languages, you will also grasp the basics of Responsive Design course but you will have to do other JavaScript courses to became a Junior Front-End Developer in the ""real life"".",2
"Not as detailed as I would have liked. However, I did indeed learn a few things. In this case, it may have been because I'm a professional developer, just not a web developer. I sort of wanted more, but perhaps it's inappropriate for me to ask. Nevertheless, I do feel the course was rather week overall.",2
"No material to read, Javascript is way more than just 10 hours. even for a jump start.this course needs more material and more practice.",2
I can't give more for this course 2/5,2
Didn't teach more.,2
This course had too much content in one-run and some of the topic-assignments had too much confusing questions and answers which were hard to figure out made this course a bit a bad experience. The same goes for the end-assignment project where much functionality was required within a short time -- and the course was delayed so many of the students could not fit it into their schedule.,2
"Materials and topics were good, but the course lacks in two things. They stress more on math and theory. I would suggest additional videos explaining the implementation in matlab would be helpful and would throw more insight to the maths. Second there is no programming assignments, so its a little easy kind of. If the instructor or the TA would help out in giving the assignments and implementation in matlab, then it will be one of the ever-lasting courses",2
Confusing assignment instructions were frustrating. The lack of response to questions was disappointing and stressful. I took the HCI course in 2014 that was precursor to this certificate program and it had a better flow and more organized.,2
"If your goal is to just get a certificate to put on your resume, this specialization will check the box. The assignments are poorly thought out, overly rigid for requiring very specific methods and mediums, and the peer review system is kind of a joke. If you're sincerely interested in learning IXD and creating a high quality portfolio piece, this course is moderately helpful toward that end, but you'll need to supplement it with lots of outside reading and in person coursework to really get where you want to be. If you're weighing whether to attend an in-person course or program or go with this specialization to save some $, just know that you'll get what you pay for.",2
"chaotic organization, unclear instructions, and confusing due dates; I would not recommend such specialization",2
"Never before have I had to create so many fake accounts, nor write so many long and laborious manuscripts to be able to complete the assignments. There were also so many problems with this last and final Capstone project - delay in start date, plague of technical issues from Coursera, lack of support from teaching staff (and Coursera) when issues were experienced, and instructions that were not clear enough at times. I'm very much glad to be done, and congratulations to all of you who made it through this last and arduous process. Job well done!",2
"Week 4 was particularly tough to get through. Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting. Videos came through blurry despite using ""high quality"" settings. There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized. On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed. And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself. In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research.",2
you can take the assignments only if you pay,2
This is a very general overview of the topic but lacks depth.,2
The instructors were not very engaging.,2
"This course means well, but with very little critical thinking required, it ultimately communicates good intentions over solid content.",2
"This course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us. Lexalytics isn't available for a Mac, so I couldn't even use it. I think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them. It might be useful for some (especially those in B2C or willing to play around with the tech), but it was a waste of time for me. I would have preferred to just take a look at some proven case studies linked to the tools.",2
"I am a bit frustrated, as the course is built around this amazing tool: IBM Bluemix, that gave us high hopes of extracting super useful information, but it is impossible to use. The instructions seem outdated and not relevant to the actual tool, there are lots of different sets that make it even more confusing and even after getting round a lot of the technical difficulties, the tool doesn't seem to be very useful... :( I feel like I wasted a lot of time trying to get this to work, with no results so far.",2
"Aside from week 4, I found this course to be little more than a commercial for various social analytics programs. Also, there's a Google+ assignment. Google+ wasn't relevant five years ago, let alone in 2016. There's some potential in this course but it desperately needs to be updated for 2017. This course may be helpful to people just starting out as social media professionals but if you're already working in this field, you will find this course incredibly dull.",2
"This course has some great information and guidance for delving into the social media landscape. However, the tools that come with the paid version are not easy to use or well explained for the lay person.",2
"Using MOOC 2, I was really hoping we would go more in depth on (free) tools like Google Analytics. I would have liked information on how to better utilize the information I get from Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook's built in analytics tools as well. I know I'm under-utilizing them at present, and there's good stuff there.In spite of claims to the contrary, the Lexalytics and IBM Bluemix videos did feel like extended infomercials. Moreover, I work for a small non-profit, and we have neither the funds or bandwidth to utilize programs like this. I think the time could have been better used doing a deeper dive with Klout and SocialMention. I'm working on the assignment now and feel like we barely scraped the surface with both of these programs.There are just too many tools being introduced in this MOOC, and not enough practical learning. Tools are fantastic, but it's important to be utilizing them properly, otherwise I end up feeling like I'm wasting time.",2
Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,2
"Could have been better!! Should explain, not just read out the presentation. Anyone can do that.",2
Could have been presented in a better way.,2
"All the information discussed were already present in the slides. Poor presentation throughout the course. An However, interesting connection between the Internet of Things, and Augmented Reality.",2
So Basic and only useful for common knowledge not something for a specialization,2
"Much expected from this course, but this course is not up to the mark.",2
This course is bit disappointing because of the way it has been presented. Ideally the speaker should focus on detailing the points highlighted in the slides but in this course the speaker is just passing on the same information which are there on slides without adding much value. Although i was deeply interested in this subject and would look forward to the revised version of the same.,2
Introduction is fine. But was less interactive. Found instructor reading slides only throughout the lecture which was boring and less interesting. Like other Coursera course i found it boring whatever text on slide i learnt but nothing interactive and practical. Just a slide reading. Very much theoretical. Disappointed,2
"Not useful, learned very little from it.",2
This instructor reads of a script! He rushes through the hard things and slows through the easy things!,2
"Interesting information, but the presentation of it is poor. The speaker is almost entirely reading from the Powerpoint presentation you're being shown - they could have let you download that and you wouldn't have missed out on anything, really. Disappointing.",2
I did not like this course. It is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies. Very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation. I had a lot of experience in classical music but I was puzzled with what goes on in this course. After having completed some other jazz courses I realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently. The title of the course is misleading. It rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation.,2
"The class covered a good variety of subjects to learn. There are some key areas of improvement:1) You should build more examples in the lectures. The lectures were short to start with, but adding more examples and passages would have helped.2) Xylophone is perhaps the worst instrument to use to teach this course, especially with the camera facing the front of the xylophone. It was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets (especially when using chords) and therefore it was very difficult to understand (visually) what Gary was doing. I suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard (look at how several people have done this on YouTube). This way you can see what notes are being hit, held, and you can see them from a pianist's view.The material was good, but because of the two areas above the teaching was not as effective.",2
"The content is really great....However, you can buy the book for $15 and get almost all of the same information — in sum, the class is essentially chapters from the book, the movie and a bunch of links to websites with relevant content.",2
An interesting documentary but I wouldn't call this a university course. Quite annoying the continuous advertising of the professor's book.,2
Seems light on material. Professor misses no opportunity to pitch his book.,2
"Between the book plugs,and the seemingly partisan descriptions of later Presidents,the course goes from a factual overview,to a meandering book pitch",2
"The videos are slow and unengaging and way too much text on each slide. A few of the assignments have been weird, not so good brief and hard to find out how to do it correct and well.",2
"I think the course covers pretty good range of topics and gives you a good information. I really liked the peer review assignments and I think they put pressure on you to achieve the goals and learn from them.I definitely did not like the multiple answer questions or the last assessment. The questions are not well presented and there is a clear violation of the help and error recovery heuristic for me. I also did not like the video set-up. The quality of the course material is really poor and disappointing. I would like to believe that on a UI course people would have come up with a better and more intuitive set-up. Finally, I would like to have a document in the course resources that students can download and keep that contains all the information we taught like quick reference guide. Again we can download the videos but when you are looking to fins something specific searching in 2-3 videos is not fun at all.",2
A bit difficult to understand the language for non native speaker. Nearly impossible to complete works.,2
unable to submit any home work for marks,2
"Video lectures are really bored, bad presented and almost useless. Most (if not all) of the useful content is presented in sections called web tours which are collections of websites were one can find information about the specific topic of a lesson. But many of the websites are bad organized, difficult to read/navigate or simply outdated. The course should be called Web Resources About IoT. I forced myself to keep going for two weeks/modules before I decided to buy a good book and take a more specific course like the one about Real-Time Systems",2
"The material in this course is well presented, though scarce at times. However it has its share of problems :-little to no interaction from TA's or mentors in the forums-the quizzes are often out of sync with the lectures-the final exam has severe problems with questions (form not content).In more detail, on the final exam, some of the questions don't even contain all the content to answer them. They can request multiple answers but have single question boxes and/or the reverse.",2
"Good video lectures, pointless assignments .",2
"The material is very interesting. There a a huge number of quizzes over poorly explained (or not at all explained) models, which would still be an interesting challenge if the models themselves had better explanations. This has been the most frustrating Coursera class I have taken, not because of the subject difficulty, but because of the lack of adequate resources for working with the models.",2
"The creators were too lazy to actually film themselves, instead most videos are just text on a screen with music. Creates a bit of a feeling of a kindergarten festival. I'll stick around until I get too bored.",2
I didn't learn a lot from this course. It didn't explain technical IT architectures of IoT.,2
"Excellent material, good organization and presentation. But - too many (""demanding""?) peer-reviewed assignments for such a short course.",2
She just started with wk 2. There should have been more explanation and videos in week 1...not very interesting. I think statistics you need to take in person.,2
"The course was interesting, but I would have appreciated more academically rigorous assessments. As the course is currently designed, you either get 100% or 0%!",2
The theory is excellent but the exercises are too difficult for beginners.,2
"This course was not overly interesting, it felt more like listening to someone wanting to paint everything with a socialist brush. I had better things to do. This has not been a class where I learned much. Its structure of super short videos (~4mins) with easy ""tests"" was neither challenging nor useful to confirm the value of the content, in fact a number of tests quiz you on material not yet covered (usually in the next unit). Not the best class there is.",2
"This course, though fun, was not intensive at all. The main issue I have is probably with the Coursera structure itself. Many of your homework assignments are based off of if people can understand the instructions of the game- which, if you have mostly non-English speakers, sort of takes the homework from being ""be creative and challenge yourself"" to ""make sure everything you write down is 3 words max or else the people GRADING you won't understand it"". This is also true when looking at these students' games- when half of your grade depends on your clarity, these kids are ultimately at a disadvantage. I'm sure there were amazing games made by some of the non-English speaking students, but I wasn't able to understand and play many of them. It is fantastic that Coursera is open to everyone, but when your grades are based off of clarity of language, it gets tricky.",2
Enjoyable but limited content,2
The lectures tend to be a bit boring. However the hands on assignments give great insight into understanding the basic concepts of game design and narration.,2
The instructor is good but the amount of content is severely lacking compared to alternatives.,2
idk its not what i expected. i really want to start with actually making a computer game not a paper game,2
"This course is really hard, and I am having ALOT trouble understanding it. Overall, it is not one of the best courses I have taken.",2
"It is really not for beginners. The first week was ok , but we didn't spend much time coding. Then it was really difficult to follow.",2
"Couldn't fiish the course. Not hard, but exhausting and not interesting.",2
Could not get through the first week. Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries. I I already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea I could get a refresher on Java. If your a beginner there are way better courses out there. This course is all over the place and I could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming.,2
"When the heck do you actually start programming? It's just him explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining. I did a little course work where I programmed some simple console applications like talking about my name and favorite games, but then he drones on for hours and hours about concepts without actually putting them to practice. He jumps through parts that could have otherwise given valuable information and experience like creating the deck class. Nope, he just has it all premade for you. The course stresses ""You'll need to program a lot to gain experience, so you'll be doing it a lot of programming in this course."" - but I'm not, there's no programming at all. It's just droning on and on about concepts and how they work.Yes it's important to learn what these things do, but it's much more important to put them to practice. My eyes are glossing over trying to sit through these 15 minute long videos of him just explaining concepts rather than having me put them to use.I do not recommend this course to anyone unless you have a Bob Ross fetish, and like listening to monotone talking. I can learn and so much more and gain valuable experience, just by googling and youtube videos. I'm very disappointed in this series.",2
"The software video tutorials need to be updated ..for example mac users need to use different programs which raises all sorts of different questions on where to go and where to find what Dr. T is working with for the lesson , second this is for beginners we would like to know why we are typing certain commands and what they do ... he has a good attitude but explanations need to be a little more detailed on what things are ,what they do and why we are using them... for any mac user you will be better off using parallels to install Windows and use this lessons with the programs he is working on like Visual Basic which is only for Windows ....",2
Some lessons are too simple. The homework is not very clear and you need much more time to do it than it is said.,2
"This class was actually about responsive web design, NOT information design. The two are in no way synonymous. Information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aids comprehension. Responsive web design is about creating different interfaces for different device form factors. I'm not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two, but he did.The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is that there was, in fact, some interesting info about responsive web design. If Coursera would change the title to ""Responsive Web Design"" instead of ""Information Design"" I'd give the course 4 stars.",2
"Assignments are not always relevant or clearly explained. More resources on how to complete them properly (for example, suggestions about how to do prototyping and what tools to use) would also help improve this course.",2
"I'm several months into this specialization. It seems to practice little of what it preaches in its design and pedagogy. I've paused repeatedly because I find the whole experience needlessly clunky and frustrating, and I rarely feel like I've learned much at the end of the assignments. I often wonder if anyone on the UCSD/Coursera side ever actually tries to complete the assignments. The quiz is missing key links and the questions read as if they were written by someone who's first language is not English. Pretty sloppy effort.",2
This was the paper I was most looking forward to in the Interaction Design specialisation. Unfortunately it seems as if they ran out of time to design it properly (despite extending its start date several times). I didn't learn what I would've expected and all of the assignments blurred into one another,2
I was disappointed by this Course maybe because I had a great expectations for it. Months of delay and poor content.,2
"This specialisation started off good in the first 1-2 courses but has since taken many steps back. The content is dated and not well though through, and it feels like the whole thing could have been put into 2-3 courses",2
"Video lectures did not provide much information. Coursework instructions were unclear (and had typos). I enrolled in November, but the course start date kept getting pushed back by a week or two at a time until it was ready 4 months later. With all of the extra time taken to put the course together, I expected to get a lot more out of it.",2
"I was quite disappointed by this course, after several delays the course stated months later than originally planned. The videos are badly edited, and there did not seem to be a lot of content within this course.",2
"My suggestions:** videos: pace is way too fast, and without much visuals and a clear structure/plan, hard to fully grab in one view. I don't think your 5mn max duration really makes sense. When the content is of interest, better to make it longer to improve clarity. Positive: you provide written/text versions of your videos.** support documents: way too many and not always relevant** quizzes: i don't think that asking us the name of a founder etc. really test anything about our understanding of our lesson. Too many irrelevant questions.All in all, it seems you applied one of the rules you discuss in this course: release fast, and adjust later on based on customers' feedback.. Unsure this is the right approach when it comes to online learning. I had higher expectations vs. Mines Telecom.",2
"Rather superficial, the poorest one of the modules so far.You have to shoot at the end. I wish I new it in advance, I wouldn't have enrolled.",2
"He has a clear outline, but his definitions are not clear and are very vague. His thought process is unorganized.",2
Minus 3 stars for 3 complaints1. Infographics for Journalism might be a better title. The grading guidelines for the project see all specific to one type of publishing.2. Grades assigned by fellow classmates are very subjective and sometimes miss the points made it the material.3. Some of the class material is posted on YouTube and has advertising. I didn't buy into the class so I could watch ads!,2
"Sweet and short course. However, if you dont have Adobe Ilustrator nor plan to buy the Certification, it is a little bit too short and basic.",2
"I've finished my specialization in ""Python for Everyone"" and thought this specialization would be a nice follow on. The instructors are funny and try to keep it light, but it certainly is NOT an intro level course. It took me nearly 8 months to finish the final 3 projects. I won't be continuing this specialization. It might have been OK if they had an intro to OOP that was a prereq for both of these courses",2
The course content was somewhat scattered and lacked focus. I think the whole topic of the talent pipeline was completely lacking structure and cohesiveness. Cheri's presentations were not as engaging as the others and her slides were poorly prepared - often difficult to read and not necessarily related to the topic at hand,2
"One of the main presenters, who led about half of this course, would greatly benefit from an editor to help them organize their ideas. This, and a presentation style that made me feel ""talked down to"", similar to reading a story book to a small child, made comprehension of ideas frustratingly difficult. The content they were responsible for covering was why I signed up for a paid multi-course specialization. Though I learned lots of other things I'll no doubt find helpful, I did not walk away with the information I need the most. The other presenters were great, as usual, and presented their topics in a clear, concise manner.",2
"The part of course from Prof. Sytch and Prof. DeRue was really interesting and important. But I cannot complete this course, because part of Dr. Alexander is impossible to listen. It is necessary all the time to separate useful information from enormous amount of information about her private life. Is it a course about private life of Dr. Alexander or about Managing Talent? And I am 30 years, not16. She is talking with us like we are small kids, and so she can keep our attention only by special voice and multiple stories her private life.",2
"The first and the last week propose basic, but self-explaining inputs in an uninteresting manner. Nevertheless, there are some quite good take aways. Out of the four courses of the specialization, Managing Talent is the weakest",2
Some good points. Spends a lot of time on self-advertisement. Takes a lot of time to get to the point.,2
it's good but can be better they have to give more examples about the concept,2
"I thought the course was oldfashioned, it doesn't prepare you to be a journalist in the digital age, where terms like crowdfunding, search ability, new businessmodels, apps and social media are key factors of success. Yes, there was a small section where they explained crowdsourcing (lol) but interviewing as many people as you can seems to be cryptosaurus approach. Also the social media tips seem to be very interesting if you're 65+. It's worth following this course for free but definately not your money, the free course on futurelearn had ten times more content and I learned so much more...",2
Knowledge provided here was just a common sense.,2
Ill give two stars cause lectures are way to boring to follow.,2
i think the coming classes will be great more than that ... but it's good,2
"I found difficult to navigate within the course and the style of the course is not very modern. I felt difficult to follow the whole program, which might be also linked to my level of English that might not have been good enough, considering the technical vocabulary used in the program. However some interesting and very concrete tips to learn",2
extremely easy and sparse content.,2
this is a good course but if you think better and deeply you will understand that deep inside you your self know this things but maybe you did not do in daily life.,2
Boring techniques for remembering.Nothing related to learning or understanding.,2
"While the instructors may be well versed in their fields, I felt the course took too long to get to the meat of the issue. I suppose I wanted a faster-paced course without a lot of hand-holding.",2
Didn't learn as much as expected about learning how to learn. Maybe my expectations were too high.,2
"Really basic, with some interesting stuff but could be reduced to a third of the time...",2
I want it to be more exciting.,2
"it has a lot of nice information about the brain and ways of study, but this whole course is a way of procrastinating.I feel like it could have been summed up really much better into written text and finished at a much faster rate.",2
"This will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of education.Teachers show mastery on their subject matter , though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated, to the point that it may feel boring.",2
Proprietary. To me is unacceptable. But the professors really do have a charm to them so I will give them an extra star for that.,2
"I can access to some contents: videos and lectures, but I can not send quizzes or assignments and to get feedback without paying a fee for this course, very limited! :(",2
"This course is rather superficial, it sadly did not provide practical tips that go beyond common sense.",2
"I think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work. However, it does not really help to write a paper. I think some ideas are not applied to every field. In particular, telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly, it is in my opinion a bit unethical. Moreover, I was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor, but instead, it is done by a group of PhDs, some of them in their first year of research. If they intend to target a PhD audience, this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do. Finally, as some people already pointed out, the quality of the English of some of the instructor is not good. In particular, there are a couple of them that you can't barely understand. It would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the 2 of them that can actually speak good.",2
The contains of the course is not really enough for improve the writing skill for scientific paper. Those advices mention in the video is common and that's it. No more practice or example to help the learner understand or apply that concept to their writing.,2
"I find this to be very very basic advice on how to write a scientific paper. I can't even see where the ""project"" is coming, plus the strong accent of instructors makes it really hard to follow sometimes -- even with the subtitles. To make things even better, accessing the quizzes is imposible unless you pay for the certificate. I found the course disappointing.",2
it was too basic information/material for what I was expecting,2
"I was quite disappointed in the capstone; I have not found the quality of the questions to be very high, and more than once there has been a disconnect between the question asked and how the reviewer is asked to grade it. I understand there are some limitations in working with such a large and diverse group of students, but peer-reviewing is not productive or particularly helpful, and I expected more interaction with the professors for a capstone (especially one that comes at a cost).",2
"Very nice introduction to the topic. I wish it had more ""meat"" and more exercises to develop the skills presented during the class.",2
Arguably the worst of the bunch as far as learning anything. *sigh*,2
Module about codecs was great.The rest was too easy. An equivalent to reading manual on internet. No value added :(.,2
Big difference in difficulty between the math-heavy codec theory lectures and the other material which is quite basic. Not much to do with the DragonBoard.,2
OK. the main professor clearly knows his stuff. On the other hand he goes into unnecessary detail and then quizzes you on it even though its not relevant to the course (typical bricks and mortar education type BS). The assistant instructors (likely this guys students) are not as great and the whole thing is amateur night.,2
"Very much low details and the course instructor has very slow pace when he is teaching on the board that (aaaa,aaaa) is very irritating....",2
"This course is not terrible, I learned a few things, but it is poorly designed.Some things are explained as if to people who aren't familiar with the concepts at all, while others are explained as if to people who must already know a lot about the concepts. I often felt lost. The ""quizzes"" did not help, you could do well on them without actually understanding things (I remember one multiple-choice question where the options were something like (a) ""Arrhenius's first law"", (b) ""Arrhenius's second law"", (c) ""Arrhenius's third law"", and you didn't even have to look at the question or know what the law was to know the answer because only one of Arrhenius's laws had been mentioned in the course at all).There are two types of videos in this course. In one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things. These videos are useful and mostly understandable. The other type of videos are lecture-style things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos - sometimes the professor refers back to ""earlier"" parts of the lecture that we haven't actually seen before. Concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to.",2
"OK introduction to material properties, but not rigorous (leaves out definitions, motivation and conclusions/consequences) and skips some things that come up on the quizzes. No worked examples.",2
"I was disappointed with the treatment of the main concepts. They were cursorily dealt with. Examples from the real world and a more graphic explanation esp. of the crystal defects would have helped. Otherwise, all the main points were covered.",2
"The video lectures are not very polished, and I think it would have been better to have a few longer videos than so many short ones.",2
Very basic. Not much deep,2
"Course address some elementary issues about IoT, but the instructor at times seems like he does not have a good grasp of the lecture materials. No access to quizzes or evaluations as auditing participant, which is a shame since most of the Coursera MOOCs allow access to evaluation material under the auditing modality.",2
This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason. The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses. As a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks. The assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded. The saving grace is that the course is just 4 weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time.,2
Less lab exerciser only theoretical introduction,2
"It was overall a good course for a beginner but too much theoretical things are there, one needs to push more on practicals.",2
Only 2 * because of technical issue that i faced in most of the videos are not loading properly . they will stuck somewhere and only audio will be continuing . so i couldnt finish the course. apart from that teaching is really good.hope you guys work on it to fix it.,2
Boring,2
"I thought the material was presented at an overly high level and was not particularly useful, particularly in the second half of the course. Add more detail. Furthermore, the presentation style of the professor is not engaging, nor does he address interesting archetypes or examples in his lectures. The early material was fine but again presentation could be dramatically improved. Lastly, the assignments were rather interesting early on but once again quality decreased as the course progressed.",2
"Aimed only for people with zero background in the IoT paradigm. While well organized and structured, it only provides the student with the minimum basics of the IoT and embedded systems concepts.",2
"This class is an extreme example of an introduction to a subject - very basic information. I would guess that anyone who actually knows the term ""Internet of Things"" and was able to find this course already knows all of the content presented here. For completeness and ensuring that everyone is on the same page, I suppose it it required. I took off one star for how basic, yet drawn-out the information is (it could have been covered in a single week). The other two stars came off because of how tedious the peer-review assignments are and how little they add to the understanding of the content (it is not hard to understand, so the assignment ends up just being busy work). The two stars I gave were because the instructor seems knowledgable and the rest of the specialization looks promising.",2
"Very rushed, incomplete examples and gaps in content. I'm not sure what audience Coursera is aiming for, but it doesn't seem to be anyone who doesn't already know a programming language.",2
"As someone with a very limited background in statistics, I found the course jumped very quickly from basics to extremely complicated statistical modeling with all the jargon that comes with it. So either the course description didn't provide enough information for a non-statistician to realize it will get very complex, or the language and explanations should have been simplified/more descriptive for the audience.",2
What I've watched wasn't as what I expected.I would give it 2 out of 5 as addressing my needs.,2
"The course looks a lot like advertisement of a textbook. I don't have anything against ads, but ads are not very suitable for teaching.",2
too easy,2
The way the tests accept the answers can lead to a very frustrating experience. The test would mark my answers wrong for no reason. Sometimes I would change nothing between tests and get the previously marked incorrect answer correct. Besides this glitch however this course was great.,2
"Very good course for basic physics. If you're looking for a physic course to build the base for Mechanical Engineering, highly recommend this one.",2
"The course seems to be a course in Scrummerfall, i.e., a mixture of Scrum and Waterfall. After having briefly discussed the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes things like ""People over processes,"" what is the first thing that they dive into? Processes where they say things like ""Requirements combined with processes are the backbone of any successful software project."" I would disagree. Requirements and processes are important, but people and communications are the backbone of any successful software project.I'm dropping this specialization and searching for another course that really follows Agile methodologies.",2
The quizzes are about the course structure and not product management.,2
"Only the link agilemanifesto.org has real value in this course. The rest is self-PR and ""water"". I see no reason paying for the sertificate and I am not convinced further cources of this specialization will deliver greater value.",2
"A little disappointed in this course, it would have been better suited for the first part to a larger course other than a week long introduction to th subject.",2
"Not really about Product Management, but about Project Management",2
Small introduction. I was expecting some thing concrete.,2
Dry principles without real life examples and exercises. You can passed the quiz by just reading online or have basic project management experience. Disappointed.,2
Defiantly the worse MOOC I have taken. Does the specialisation need such a long introduction?,2
The Course could have been covered in a more interesting way,2
I had much more expectations from this course but this was just a brief overview of content(Not covering all topics) of what actual International business should be.Rather than just wasting time like this they should have been crisp and short but actually this professor was good at giving examples.,2
"Extremely clear presentations by the researchers, but loses 2 stars for relying on assignments based on Google Docs which did not load properly and resulted in me not being able to complete the course.",2
"the information was presented so slowly that it was hard to follow. i have taken a couple other introductory biology/genetics courses so some of the information was familiar, but i (and a friend who watched over my shoulder) found the videos nearly unwatchable due to the slow pace the presenters were speaking",2
Very disappointed in this course. It is more of an infomercial for American Gut than an actual course. Additional knowledge gained was very little.,2
"While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that don't result in a great learning experience. The course resources comprise of videos and notes. The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking. Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes. Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources. As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning. A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it. However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials. Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment.",2
"The contents of this course could be interesting, but they end up being terribly boring. The course lacks examples to bring things to life. A pity!",2
"Positive: Readings and references allow for an additional study of related course concepts.Negative: Course is excessively short - both in number of modules and also in resources per module. Quizzes are excessively easy. This course is basically a small part of a previous course in International Marketing in Asia. I think a new set of courses should have been presented and not this. Some of the concepts are excessively focused in Asia... Also the LG interview videos seem excessivelly of 'free' publicity. It should be avoided.Overall - in my opinion, to be relevant in the online you have to upscale your game. Yonsei presents very short courses, as it can be seen in the specialization emerging technologies. Hope you can change your approach in the future or I don't think your courses will have traction. Please review your next courses in the specialization not to be parts of your previous course but to have new materials... I don't think is very credible to slice a course and offering it in 6 parts and call it a specialzation.I wish you luck.",2
"The final assignment is peer graded, which means you'll have to deal with idiots grading your final assignment.",2
"Poor.Course crammed with unnecessary details (loads of CSS ""decoration"" properties that one may test on it's own), without focusing on CSS fundamentals, such as page layout strategies, float-based layouts, element positioning which, in my view, are discussed only very superficially.I'll forget 90% of discussed ""decoration"" properties in a few days but when I think of CSS paradigms - a structure that can be later filled with easily forgotten/easily retrieved ""decoration"" properties - that I'll take with me ""for ever"" out from this course.... sounds empty. The extra star goes for stressing the importance of accessibility.To sum up: decoration largely outweighs structure.",2
"While I love Dr. van Lent's teaching style, I was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole. After about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums. It wasn't until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearance.This was an issue as, especially in the first week, as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric, what was provided in description for the homework, and what was in an optional video that described the homework. All with no official direction as to what was correct, or how things should be properly graded. The students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant, and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading. This continued, albeit to a far lesser extent, through the remainder of the course.While I don't expect instructors to be in the forums all that often, I do expect them to clear up obvious issues, and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed. I believe this was the first offering of this course, and I hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed, and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forums.As far as the material itself, it is pretty good, and covers most of the basics well. As I said at the start, I really love Dr. van Lent's teaching style. She is very encouraging, and easy to understand. She is also very human, making mistakes as she goes along, and correcting them. I feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is, that even with experience mistakes are still made, and to be expected, and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes.",2
"This course was actually quite helpful for learning Chinese, and it provides fascinating information about Chinese culture. Besides learning the language, you'll learn about holidays, foods, and art, and you'll hear Chinese music.Unfortunately, I could not give the course a good rating because I found some quiz questions impossible to complete. This questions required answers to be typed in Pinyin or in Chinese characters. However, the course gave no information on how to type the Pinyin tone marks or Chinese characters into the response boxes. I tried asking about this in a discussion forum, but got no answer.",2
"The testing in this course is horribly crafted. Not is it only too easy, thus not actually testing students what is learned, the answers for some of the questions are incorrect. On the very last quiz, I was not able to finish the course because the answer for one of the questions was incorrect. In answering how to translate ""South,"" the answer should be ""nánbian,"" but when I selected this option, it was marked wrong. Therefore, I have to wait 7 more hours before selecting an incorrect answer to complete the course.",2
"While the efforts of the coursemakers are greatly appreciated, much could be done to refine the quality of the course. Many materials have broken links and the lack of character entry for some practice problems poses an issue as pinyin with tones is rather hard to type.",2
"I think it is a very basic course, or for people who have very little previous knowledge. The concepts are not very clear. It may not be appropriate for a person who already has college education.",2
interesting information but TOO many LONG lectures that were VERY repetitive.,2
"These themes felt very surface-level and redundant. The material could likely have been covered more quickly and allowed for more time to be spent on more tangible, every day information that might help those that are not already teachers.",2
"The course content is perfect, however the rating system is kind of disappointing. First, the rating is very subjective, thus I might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation. Second, sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday, however, there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed, thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays. Could I just pass if there's no other submission to review?",2
I hope this course can be more systematic in terms of the structure on the concepts and lecturers.,2
"There is quality implicit in the approach taken, but in my opinion, this course is excessively short, having only 20-25 minutes of videos per week, what is very limiting. Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate. To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures, slides would be determinant. Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning.",2
I feel like there should be more teacher involvement within this course.,2
"Honestly I cannot believe that this course won't allow people to go an extra mile to make something better and learn more than what course was designed for. How is it possible that I try to do something different and better than what I was requested to do and because of that I got bad gradings because it was different even though it met the projects requirements? I left a complaint and this is the response from one of the mentors ""john f davis replied: all I could say is keep your personal touch in your GitHub and submit the nonpersonal touch version to be graded.""How is this going to allow the students to learn more if they are going to be graded badly if they do? If we are not allowed to work on something greater? I'm disappointed with the peer grading system but even more with this kind of attitude from a ""mentor"".",2
"Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material. Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.",2
"The course and the knowledge provided is OK. But the peer correcting is really bad, it takes tool long, some people are cheating and if you're unlucky you may not be corrected at all and fail the course",2
Too many concepts were crammed into. It isnt basic.,2
Better than the first course of the specialization but the concepts are still explained not clearly,2
"a) There clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis. The presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it.b) A lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects. For example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month??c) It is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis. The too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system). Secy Geithner's focus in week 8 comes across as a personal defence of his actions rather an objective analysis of what was done and should have been done.",2
"Some good information but very much a political course, not much of an economics course. Stating, as if it is a given, late in the course, that there are times when it is okay to introduce a moral hazard. Erroneously defining fiat money early in the course. Stating, again as if it were a given, that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis. When politicians and their pawns develop a course should we be surprised that the answer is always more government intervention? Oh, if only we had more tools to stop this, never realizing their role in creating the crisis.",2
"The Capstone itself (Option 1) is very interesting, but there is no really graduated evaluation.",2
"Again, I wish the teachers would explain explicitly what is needed for the programming exercise. I felt abandoned by the faculty when I was trying to work out the programming exercise. There is an assumption that we as students know what the teachers are talking about.",2
"Logic can be fun, but this class pretty much kills that spirit by burying it under pretty horrendous and tedious formalization. An intro to logic should be considerably simpler, and with more interesting content and exercises.",2
"I would like more tasks to help learn, it's also really really easy to guess your way to the right answer. A _lot_ of concepts, words and specific tools are introduced, with not much opportunity to actually use them meaningfully and feel that one has actually learned a skill (as opposed to temporarily remembered the concepts for the quiz). Was nice not to have to watch videos though, and the slides are good.",2
"overall: some weeks were fun, some notin some weeks are too many chapters and exercises. I actually think that the exercises are too complicated compared to the examples in the chapters. Sometimes are the explanations in the chapters not sufficient.It would be helpful to know the name of a proof e.g. Perch's Law or law of (the) excluded middle. This would help to find more information and help.",2
"I initially found the week two section very frustrating due to the absence of worded examples (real sentences) that might've appeared alongside the logic-symbols that were being defined. I would put it down to a personal fault, if it were not the case that I grasped the notation fully within minutes of finding another source of learning.",2
"It started really well with the deduction and induction ... However, in the later part of the series the explanation and examples were very light and process of creating new models could have been detailed more",2
"THIS course is only good if you have basic knowledge regarding ,materials science and this course is highly based on research papers and research domain . Overall a good course .",2
The course seems to be useful but the tasks become hell. You need either give more information and examples or decrease the complexity of the questions and tasks,2
"In my opinion, the sound quality is quite low and this makes it difficult to follow the lectures smoothly. And I found the current response in the FQA section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging... .I am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginners and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed. I did not have any knowledge in those areas and I found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course. So, I switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time.",2
Not a course for beginners.,2
"Mistakes during the videos are only corrected in its review. Often there's a new attempt of Andrew Ng to say something without even cutting out the first attempt. The mathematical symbols sometimes didn't encode at all. The quality needs to be redone, as this was not a completely satisfying experience for an 80USD course.",2
"It shows you some great functions in Octave, but I'm confused about all the Θ₁ and Θ₂ stuff.",2
"The lecturer is very good. The course is not very insightful and on the surface. It is business oriented, it doesn't deal with interesting and challenging academic problems.",2
"Fairly good videos explaining the material, probably worth 4 starts. However, the written support material should be improved. IMHO the video should supplement the written material, i.e. it should be possible to learn the material only by reading. This is not the case, so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to long-term memory.",2
"Was a little too basic. Would have preferred more flesh (both implementational and mathematical) on the bones. I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly ""this is for the experts in linear algebra"". Come on! If one is taking a machine learning course, one can expect more from the students. Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap-dance on the surface of the material.",2
Certificate is expensive!,2
Low quality video and audio,2
"Level of difficulty of lectures is not correspond with level of quizzes. In lectures they are talking about simple stuff and then in quizzes they ask you about details they didn't mentioned. You could deducts this information though. But this is exactly the main problem with this course - for quizzes you should deduct and learn by yourself so much stuff, that videos start to be not worth your time.",2
Really wish there was an option for one-to-one mapping of the stanford course in its full rigor.,2
is very useful and interesting. But it has high level,2
thinks it's a cool course.but am getting it getting the concepts of the functions. probably needs lots of practice.Wish u all the best...,2
Not as I expected. More readings than practices/exercises. Seems more target on traditional statistics than machine learning.,2
"There's room for improvement, aspects are unnecessarily convoluted.",2
Asked for more feedback for peers that found my final paper insufficient. Received nothing! Asked for guidance from staff. Received nothing! Excellent course with great content but I have issues with the evaluation process when peers and staff do not participate in the advertised methods of communicating their concerns with my work!,2
"Geared towards ESL students. I had signed up thinking it was for native English speakers, but it was more of a English 101.",2
"This course contains quite some useful information, but overall it seems way too simple. Most of what it talked about were the basics and what common high school students would know. It could be much better if its depth could be made higher.",2
The course is great however we have to pay to get all tasks or a certificated,2
it is good for non-English native speaker. + it is not free.i liked most the additional material.,2
"Unlike the previous course in this sequence, this course provided little to no substantial information. While I fully agree with the premise of the course, the importance of leadership communication through storytelling, this course presented no sources, psychological research, or evidence to defend its arguments. It provided great ""lay advice"" with little to no research base. I would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading. It is not substantiated.",2
The material was beneficial but I would have found the course more helpful if there were weekly assignments rather than one assignment at the end of the course that incorporated all of the principles.,2
"too simple, seems like a introduction for MBA class",2
"Topics were basic but good, but I cannot understand why a physics undergrad with no screen presence and mispronunciations was asked to lead this course instead of the MBA professor who was advertised. I found that there were at least a couple of places that were ageist and overly simplistic in talking about retirement planning and there were moments that there was a paranoid anti-government vibe that I found off-putting.",2
Too basic.,2
Powerpoint slides were never offered in this course even though they were supposed to be. No follow up from teacher or teacher assistant.,2
Material is outdated and course assignments failed to challenge thinking and encourage critical engagement with the content provided.,2
too many information just to be said.,2
"I felt like this course was too repetitive. Basically, all I learned were from readings and textbooks. Video lectures were repeats from those contents. I did learn useful tools for web analytics, but I wish the instructor put some of his original insights rather than presenting articles written from other people.",2
"The lecture presents Google's ZMOT marketing model, how it benefited (and shaped) marketing research and strategies to increase conversion and loyalty. It is a good contextual introduction if you never heard of ""search engine marketing"", ""cost per acquisition"" or ""click through rate"". If you know the basics, it is probably not a good use of your time.I didn't like that the content feels like evangelism for (paid) google services, and most sources of the course are either random blogs or related to interested parties (google, twitter). I still learnt a couple of cool metrics I didn't know about, but the course didn't bring any added value to the blog links provided.",2
"The course introduces some basic concepts but fails to deliver on the objectives set out in the initial module description by barely listing out most topics through a very narrow, linear approach instead of delivering an actual in-depth explanation and commentary on the subject. Some more advanced learners will also find some tools to be out-of-date and some areas - very Google-focused.",2
to much theory,2
"Provides a comprehensive overview, however it is heavily lecture based. Would be nice if more interactivity was built in, via pop-up questions during the lectures and practice problems.",2
"It's a very introductory class, only works for newbies of digital marketing.Maybe it's a good start point.",2
I don't feel like the videos were helpful in explaining and offering guidance. They were boring and basically repeated everything given in the readings. The delivery should be improved. Kevin Hartman was clearer,2
I am taking the Digital Marketing Specialization and this has been the poorest course I have taken thus far. The instructor is obviously reading directly from a script because of her constant long pauses between words and how frequently she gets lost when presenting information. She also clicks to new slides and bullet points at the wrong time which is very disruptive. The information presented on the slides really does not summarize what she is saying at all and I constantly had to refer to the transcript to get the information I needed to write down.The assesment questions for this course are also quite poor and a lot of the time need to be further researched online. The quiz questions also seem more involved than the lectures presented and can need some researching as well. I was looking forward to this course and I am disappointed. The instruction for this course seems like she does not the subject well enough to provide insight and quite possibly as if this is the first time she is giving a lecture/presentation.,2
Too much theoretical.This course should not be a separate course.It can be a part of other course.,2
The lectures were nothing more than a person reading from the reference text. There seemed to be a lack of understanding of the material--even the jokes were taken from the book (without credit to the author).,2
"very boring lectures, the professor should not read the slides, but actually try to speak her own words, because this is causing lost interest and as a result less attention paid and less knowledge received.",2
"This type of course structure may work at an undergrad level, but for continuing education it is sub-par.The video lectures were the instructor reading the slides, reading from the course reading, or showing videos that were listed in the course reading. The course quizzes had too many questions that focused on memorizing details from the case studies or a statistic shown for a bit in the lectures rather than try to foster understanding of the material.There were some technical issues such as links from the course readings expiring and not being replaced, in-lecture questions dealing with a subject matter different from the topic of the lecture, etc.The one good thing from this course - it uses a great textbook (free), which provides lots and lots of useful data and insights into digital marketing - and this is the sole reason the course gets 2 stars instead of 1.",2
was boring. nothing interesting here.,2
I did not like the teacher but I did like the course material.,2
"This class is more of a Marketing 101 class than a digital marketing class. Interesting, and probably a great class for someone looking for the basics of marketing.",2
"Honestly didn't learn much from this course. The majority of content is simply common sense, and things you'll know if you've spent any time on the internet in the recent years. The good parts were the evaluation of different marketing channels (traditional and digital) and various stats on how people spend from the industry (ownership of TV networks, time spent per day on different media, etc.).",2
Not very much information and lesson to learn deep,2
"The first week was a bit dry but improved the following weeks. Articles we read were interesting and the assignments were engaging. Since I wanted to achieve a high grade, I found that the weekly assignments took longer to complete than described.",2
Very light in useful content,2
"Not up to my expectations. Compared to the previous modules in this specialisation, the lectures are dry, the presenter is not focused and slides are sometimes mixed up. The reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free. But the lectures should be more practical (not just the bullet points of the book), and the weekly assignment should not be a chapter summary question. The course developers should have taken the time to develop a case study for each topic, like in the first module in this spec. I highly recommend reviewing and improving the content.",2
The presenter in this course is hard to follow and does not have good slides. She often does not put her bullet points or lists on the slides ( I am a visual learner and she does not provide enough on screen info) She is really uncomfortable and makes it really hard to listen to her talk. She struggles through the entire presentation which is just super distracting. Content is good though.,2
I found this course less engaging than the previous ones in the specialization. I would have appreciated if the video lessons were focusing more on commenting case studies; in many cases I had the impression that the Professor was simply reading the slides...,2
I think this course could have been more interesting. It was very dry with just slides and majority of the examples were not explained well. Especially the one about the marketing plan was not about plan but about presentation skills. This course content definitely needs update.,2
waste of time.,2
This course is not as good as the ones that are part of the Digital Marketing specialization. It was hard to keep traction and interest to finish it.,2
"The instructor needs improvement on her presentation skills. She is just reading off the slides instead of providing more examples and scenarios to help student comprehend the material. I have to retake almost every quiz under her courses. In previous courses, I passed quizzes in one try. Please improve material or get a better instructor.",2
"This was my least favorite of the course. The questions were out of order, the videos and lectures were terrible and dry",2
"For multiple modules, the questions were out of order. Some of the videos didn't seem polished to the point that it made me think it was not the final edits?Also, from other Coursera courses, I really valued interviews and summaries that highlighted the key points (vs a summary of the topics convered).Finally, the module quizzes didn't seem to highlight the key points, but instead had questions specific to not-so-important details (e.g., which agency created the MB campaign).",2
based on impressions after module 1:-quality of lectures: just dry material from books. not engaging- repetitions (videos in reading materials and in lecture) sometimes feeling that it is waste of time-quizz questions are hardly connected to lecturesdisappointed and discouraged. give a try to module 2 and will see.,2
instructor advice is primarily to 'use stack overflow'.,2
"The course can be summarized as: ""OK, here are some tools that can be used: now read the documentation, Stack Overflow and some papers that we give you links to"". Each week there are just few videos. What I expect from a Course are baby steps and clear guidance about good practices. Of course you can learn it all from the Internet - I am taking a Course to get something I will not easily find elsewhere: a good teacher who will guide me through optimal approaches.",2
"This course was not nearly as valuable to me as the first course in the series. It breezed through a bunch of different plot types without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them. At the same time, it also didn't provide enough clear examples of how to do basic things in matplotlib, which seems to me to be a very non-intuitive thing with poor documentation. I found the first assignment to be very difficult.",2
I think there there is too much time given to the esoteric of what makes plots pretty rather than the nuts and bolts of how to do it and the limitations of using Pandas and Matplotlib for real world data,2
"I am really not sure if you need 20-30 minutes videos to explain the material - I think maybe 7-10 minutes clear with some good examples would be more helpful, I fell sleep during some of the lectures, boring, long and not sure if necessary - on the other hand I guess 20-30 minutes is good because you learn to put up with arguments and clear them up yourself - also maybe this course was directed towards high school students thus the long explanations -Overall, as I said on the beginning, it would work better with clear definitions and some examples and discussion board -",2
Teacher has difficulties speaking English and is really distracting that has bad audio in some of the lessons. Poor quality overall.,2
Course is not for free and misleading.,2
"a little propagandist, but interesting with that in mind",2
For pay quiz feedback is not part of the MOOC education movement.,2
"Great course, but it's misleading. doesn't tell you from the start that you have to pay for it.",2
Might be an instructive course but the guy who presents it is really creepy. And knowing he was involved in the official 9/11 report makes him hard to believe on any issue.,2
"Video is of poor quality, instructor distracts you picking up his glasses from his nose every 5 seconds, reading outdated (you can suggests books from 2000 on Digital topics) and last assignment is based on a website that is not longer online.",2
Empty of content,2
"This course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics. The lectures could use some serious editing too. To help you understand what I expect, I'm taking this at the same time as I'm taking Wharton's Week 1 Entrepreneurship program. I've also taken Wharton's Intro to Marketing course which I highly suggest over this course. The quality is dramatically better. Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking is a University of Virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done. I'm hoping the next courses in the Digital Marketing Capstone are much better so that I'm not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back up.On the plus side, I did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites & accomplish things as well as review your peers work. I wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though. In my experience, many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments.",2
"I think the content was quite interesting; as someone new to marketing, I was really looking forward to the lectures and exercises. However, the content was simply too much for me to complete. It's a bit ironic that a course about marketing missed its market. To give a bit more detail: there were 12 video lectures, 3 assignments that had to be done days before the end of the week to be peer-reviewed, and then I had to peer review others work, while also going through all the assigned reading. It seemed more like a courseload for a full time student or perhaps a part-time student. As online students typically are neither, I'm surprised the course content wasn't better managed. I take a lot of notes, so perhaps that's what slowed me down, but I also have a full time job and I intern on the weekends. I was hoping this course could easily be done in the evening hours. Other coursera courses provided an excellent balance of content and courseload, I'm disappointed that this course wasn't one of them. It seemed very useful and interesting.",2
"Good course, but NO Statement of Accomplishment certificate",2
"I had high expectations of this course, but must admit I'm pretty disappointed. Navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky. Not sure if that's just a Coursera thing though. The actual content (video) looks great, but is unfortunately exceedingly brief, so much so, that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article. In fact, there's not much presented that really benefits from the video format. Most 'instruction' in the course is centered around brief talks, or artist interviews, and thus you're often just looking at two people talking, or an artist showing you their work while they talk. You never even see anyone draw to my recollection.The 'work' in the course feels rather 'phoned in' at times too. Questions such as ""What did you find interesting about the video you just watched?"" seem unnecessary, and too elementary to contain any real value, especially when the videos are so brief.Having said all that, I DO think the people who made it are genuine, and have passion for comics, and comics education, and I'll continue to follow their efforts on that front.",2
"So much disjointed information.... I felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this. Am waiting for another 8 hours before I can reattempt the quiz.Personally, I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics (simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course). The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window...If you're new to statistics, I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided...",2
"This was painful. The videos were so terrible in explanation, clarity, and relevance that I ended up going to YouTube to watch the topics, and other websites to read the content relevant to the subjects. This must be improved.",2
"Personally felt this course have a lot more potential. The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts. At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them. A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations. I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts.Good thing is that this is an introductory course, and the codes are given.",2
"The course feels pretty shallow and it ignores all the interesting stuff like proofs. There is no written material available, so if you can't follow the lectures, poor you. Quizzes aren't very well formulated and sometimes the correct answer is more of a matter of opinion rather than a hard fact. Evaluation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available, so the points you'll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at all.My overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course, and I didn't learn much more than what I could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from Wikipedia. I also felt that the programming assignments were quite disjoint from the core, tough I don't feel like I understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignments made me think why something works, rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures.",2
"This course feels quite weak, especially for the paid course, for these reasons:Models (Leader as Mentor, Coach, etc..., CTFAR model), which are given in this course, are given as is, with no references on how they were developed, authorship, and how good the results of application are.Almost no (just one) external references for reading to better understanding course material.The amount of material (about 3 hours of video, 4 quizzes, 2 discussions and 1 assignment) doesn't feel like it's a month's course, more like a one/one-and-a-half week.No references on topics, described as ""hard"" during the course (for example, identifying your values), which would make this topics less ""hard"".No instructor interaction on the course forum (I don't know if this should be like this or not, but it still feels bad).However, the final assignment is good and practice oriented.",2
"I understand that this is a project centered course, however I do not feel like I walked away with a solid foundation of what goes into creating synthesizer sounds. Sure I learned that I can change parameters within a synthesis program and thereby get various sounds, but that's about all. I was expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameters and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patches rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustments so that it fits my style.",2
"The videos are very static, the content good but the course progresses in a rather slow way.The thick Dutch accent and the lack of diversity in the speakers profile is rather paramounting (but I have followed only the first three chapters).",2
"It does not fully utilize the power and possibilities of a MOOC (students cannot study at their own pace, there is no live interaction, standard quizes and assignments), which is a bit ironic.Peer-reviewing really brings down the quality of the feedback. Not everyone is capable of testing, evaluating and giving constructive feedback.",2
"As it is, unfortunetly I can only rate it as a 2/5. The lectures are presented in a reasonable way, but this is a somewhat technical course, for wich additional materials would need to be mandatory. There are no slides for the lectures, the instructor mentions chapters of a book and does not provide the materials to students pursue a more effective way of studying the materials. Also, the quizzes are excessively challeging taking into consideration that the only resource availble to students are the videos. In my opinion, presenting a course that only has videos is not an effective way of learning. To make this course more effective and to allow students to learn more effectivelly and get some learning objectives, more material besides the videos must be made available. As it is, no more than a 2/5 is possible to rate this course.",2
Not really good translation in the subtitles,2
"It would have better if the talking and coding was at the same time so that we can see its relative changes, which we can see in previous course.",2
"The professor does not pronounce the words correctly. His English grammar is bad. The terms used are too difficult to understand and way of teaching is too complicated. The PPTs are full of errors and too direct, there is no continuity. I hardly learnt anything from this video.",2
Fairly poor level of detail - you feel like you end up just learning terms without really getting a proper test on the understanding behind it.,2
"I enjoyed some of this course content, but mostly did not enjoy the course delivery. The instructor is very warm and friendly, but not well articulate. Also, the way the course content is extremely segmented into short videos, with 20 sec intros to each video, is extremely distracting and interrupted my concentration. I I felt the videos with Tiffany were unnecessary and a waste of time. Also, I felt there were not enough examples or really life examples, especially later in the course when describing different types of date and analysis.",2
"Lack of examples, sometimes it is not easy to understand what lesson is about",2
"This course needs alot more examples, especially where the statistical tools come into play. It would better to separate consumer behaviour and market research, as different courses. Basically, too much theory and too little practice.",2
"We are getting basic ideas, but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly, with NO examples / limited examples, which is what will teach us the most. Then, we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it's very difficult. Instead, too much time spent on videos of ""role playing"" - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them. Furthermore, the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time.The visuals are the best part of the course.",2
i do really disappointed because when professor starts the third & 4th week he was only throwing the information without enough explanation so i had to read more about the topics to pass the quiz .,2
"In my opinion, the professor's accent and speaking style makes the content difficult to understand. In addition, the course does not seem to have been properly designed",2
There isn't any test and the lectures are very boring.,2
It seemed like the assignments didn't really follow the videos and such. I'm coming from a python background and am totally new to c/c++.. I spent close to 3- 8 hr days trying to figure out how to code a simple read/write to EEPROM . This specialization really needs to spend equal time on the programming aspect.,2
The weeks 1 and 2 are really good!!!! The weeks 3 and 4 are going to fast and the things that are teached are not connectes with each other well. So its impossible to do the assignment 3 and assignment 4 has nothing to do with what is tought in week 4,2
"I do like the course, but Coursera has disabled discussion forums for this course, which makes it impossible for the students to interact and find answers to problems or discuss possible errors in the example code. Student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of MOOCs. Without it, this might as well be nothing more than a series of YouTube videos.Had Coursera not discontinued the discussion forums, I'd have given this course four or five stars.",2
"I did not feel that I learned as much in this course as in the previous courses of the series. The assignments in particular seemed trivial, and were compromised even further due to some technical problems with the simulator recommended for students without access to actual hardware.This course would be a good candidate for revision, with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage, and on commonly-used components such as current amplifiers and shift registers. Problems with the simulator should not be cause for compromising the assignments themselves, there are other ways to address those problems, many of which were employed by students as they competed their assignments.",2
"It was a very enjoyable course up till the end of module three where things went a bit awry; mosty due to the unexplained withdrawal of the discussion forem and the failure of the third party platform to perform correctly at 123D (which left us doing assignments that couldn't be completed with the assigned tools).A big part of the fourth module was about connecting and communicating with the internet via ethernet and wifi. That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand). I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.Ok, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process. It felt more like a beta version.",2
It could have been more in depth.,2
Week 3 and 4 lectures are robotic - Most material taken directly from the internet. It is just a form of regurgitation of online articles from strategy consulting firms with Quiz's artificially made more difficult with cheap word plays. The lecturer for Week 3 and Week 4 should resign with immediate effect and find a job at a school for lower class students where she can continue to brag about her industry expertise without being so irritating. Definitely not IE Business School material !,2
Lessons are very good but the Assignments for the later weeks are way too hard for people with no math or programming experience.,2
"Not as polished/comprehensive as the previous courses (especially week1, week5 and week6). But useful techniques nevertheless.",2
"I am afraid that this course is, to a large extend, a marketing tool for promoting the instructors' proprietary product. Its use is therefore limited for the practitioners that want a foundation on the free Python data/ML capabilities.I would not recommend this course to my colleagues.",2
"The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step-by-step. The subtitles/transcripts are a disappointment :( . Full of mistakes. Sometimes to the point of being useless or even worse - saying the exact of opposite of what the lecturer says. Since the lecturer sometimes is unclear - this is problematic. As usual - Graphlab Create sometimes crashes, however there are explanations how to run the assignments using Scikit-Learn.",2
"Course is too slow to keep focus, it's repetitive but not clear when it's really needed.",2
"Extremely highlevel, quality of the material is significantly lower than in the previous courses.",2
"The classes are not practical, and the voice of the teacher is very monotone, boring.",2
"The content seems rather thinner than that of earlier courses in the specialization, and seems to get more so as the course progresses. (Week 6 is entirely spent on Precision and Recall, with only about 30 min of lecture.) It feels like there was a rush to get the course out and that corners may have been cut at the end.And as others have mentioned, several very important classification topics are conspicuously missing.",2
"Good information, but not good for people lacking background knowledge. Lecturer reads off slides and gives very little supplementary information.",2
"Too much focus on remembering specific details and numbers, and too little focus on broader understanding.",2
8 hour waiting period after 3 tries is a pain in the arse. One more try and i would have had it.,2
"Too much math! This course was not at all what I was expecting it to be... which could be both good and bad, depending on your own perspective. It concentrates heavily on the logistical side of negotiations via mathematical analysis to figure out ""what's at stake"" in a negotiation (i.e. ""the pie"") and less so on learning actual negotiation techniques. I got halfway through the first week before deciding to un-enroll. That said, Professor Nalebuff has a very engaging teaching style and presents each lecture in a dynamic fashion via animation. If you are a math whiz who excels in algebra and can do complex mathematical equations quickly on the fly, then this course will definitely benefit you. If you are like me, however, and looking for a course that will focus more on artistry and practical real-world application, then this course is not for you.",2
After the first two introductions the course was not for me.,2
"Unfortunately, I did not find the course overly engaging and only provided very basic information. It would have been more interesting to look at a few things more in depth.",2
"The subject matter is of great interest to me but unfortunately Dr. Silverman standing paralyzed before a projected backdrop and lecturing in a monotone doesn't do it. Too much ""talking head"" (actually motionless body) and too few visuals of course material. I'm sure he's a brilliant man, but an adequate lecturer he is not. If he's so shy he might just do voice-overs. I have dropped the course and will just read the book. I would not, incidentally, rate the course at an intermediate level. Beginning would be more accurate.Onscreen videos are bad enough, being at one remove from the classroom, but onscreen videos of an immobile monotone lecturers will kill any subject.",2
"I was actually very excited for this course, yet it disappointed me. The lectures were monotonous and stiff, I found myself watching the videos on mute with the subtitles on! (p.s. the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names, locations, even simple words). I also found the lessons rather superficial, did not ""dive"" into the heart of this great civilization. Finally, having read a book or two on the subject, the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient Egypt. The course is good for those who have no previous knowledge on the subject and wish to learn the basics regarding Egypt, its gods, mummies etc.",2
"Great information, however, the professor who is clearly a specialist just stood and read the lectures. Not as interesting as they could have been.",2
I was disappointed by this course. I thought it was poorly organized and focused too much on trivia and not enough on motivating and contextualizing Ancient Egyptian civilization. I was hoping to come away from this course with a richer understanding of Ancient Egypt. The lectures were surprisingly dry.,2
Very limited treatment of the subject.,2
"Very interesting subject matter, however, sadly brought in a boring way, resulting in my quitting the course.",2
"I found listening to the instructor just read notes became very tedious very quickly. I had to force myself to finish this course which rather defeated my goal of learning for fun. The only video that engaged me was the very last one set in the artifact lab. I also feel that if you are going to offer transcriptions of the lectures, someone should proofread them. Not to do so is shoddy work and doesn't do Coursera or Penn any favors.",2
"Definitely not for a beginner.Wish there were more visuals, and assignments to do alongside the professor. Instead, it is a lecture from Power Points, that don't really line up with the assignments very well.If you have previous knowledge in another language, you'll do fine, but if you're truly looking for a beginner course, look elsewhere. Many assumptions are made by this professor that makes it less approachable by a beginner, IMO.",2
"Assignment is unclear and confusing. The material which is given is not enough , I think the course is good in general but it should focus in building the knowledge more instead of leaving many things on the air and going through the material as if it were a quick review.",2
Could have been more interactive .The ruby course that I studied from lynda.com was far better than this,2
"Lacks of structure.References multiple tools/programs ""that we won't detail in this course"" (... why are they talked about then ?).I'm almost finished but am struggling to find motivation for it.After having done the great ""HTML, CSS and JavaScript"" course, the contrast is hard to cope with.",2
"Unfortunately as a course designed to teach Rails, it is poorly paced and has a few issues. The course content is spread out over three weeks as follows...Week 1 they go over setting up a Ruby on Rails development environment, which was fine. They also went over Git and Github. While you can access all of the course content on Github, you are never actually required to use Git for any of the work in the course, and it only shows up as a few questions on the only quiz in the course.Week 2 they cover Ruby programming and syntax. There are a lot of different sources where you can find tutorials and such for learning a new language, and in this course the material was... good enough. They also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice feature.The graded programming assignment for week 2 gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and steps/commenting to assist building out your code. However there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they don't even tell you about (expected return values under certain situations) until you actually run the grader. They weren't difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to pass.Week 3 is where the major pacing problems occur. There are a number of very broad stroke videos on Rails, as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build Rail apps. A lot of the content they cover isn't even utilized in the assignments of the course.The week 3 assignment instructions are actually incomplete. They tell you a number of pre-required packages you have to install, including ones you had installed from previous assignments, but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your own.And where as the week 2 assignment was almost overly hand-holdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code, week 3 hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your Rails structure. The broad stroke videos from week 3 kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template, but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratch.A major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment (and that requires separate registration to use). During several periods, over multiple sessions of the course, the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as 48 hours at a time; during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirement.What the assignment is asking for isn't even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required, and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement. But you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site (in which case you are not learning from the course) or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templates/scaffolding from the course GitHub content, in which case you don't get a good reinforcement of the material.In the end I wound up getting a certificate, feeling like I passed despite the course rather than because of it. There is some good foundation for a course in here, but it just falls apart in the third week and lacks any real depth.",2
"Initially I thought this was a great course, but my optimism quickly dissipated. The homework assignments all required information that wasn't covered in the lectures, forcing hours of searching for answers. During the week, questions in the forums were answered within a day or so, but there was no help at all on the weekends. If I got stuck on a Friday night and couldn't find an answer myself, I had to wait until Monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant. For those who work during regular business hours and use their free time on the weekends to study, this course becomes nearly impossible to complete.",2
"This course should be revised. The material was lacking (just static images, no real time coding), overall engagement for the courses was also lacking The instructor sounded low quality and sometimes a bit hard to understand. I could no complete this course, unfortunately.",2
"Too much work in a week. I'm working and I have finished some other courses which were a bit lighter, although longer in time. I would be mad if I try to finish this course on time. It's a bit disappointing.",2
This course and its related courses are rough around the edges. Things are not always intuitive.,2
very fast,2
"I had issues uploading the Assigned Homeworks, course was ok, still, a bit complex and fast to be treated as intro to ruby",2
"I hate to write a negative review when the designers of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it. But...The quality of the code is bad. The quality of the testing code is even worse. This endeavours to teach some horrible practices. That's a shame, because the editing quality of the videos is excellent, the use of git and rspec is likewise commendable.Even worse, it's not entirely clear who the target audience is. A lot of the topics introduced are aimed at complete novices, yet not explained in a way novices might understand. The course needs some serious rethinking and refactoring.",2
"Lost after 2nd week. I really liked the Python For Everyone Course so I thought I would like this one as well, but it was not done to the same standard. I will find another way to learn Ruby.",2
good course,2
Too basic.,2
"I learned some things that I didn't know from this class. Compared to other classes that I have taken on Coursera, it has rather low production values.",2
Explanations of concepts are too complex for non-biologist who want to approach the Genomic field,2
"While the content of the course is interesting and useful, the delivery desperately needs improvement. The professors speak in an extremely monotonous way, making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera. Just awful, and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic (even when you're passionate about the subject).I would rather have the course in Italian, and read the subtitles, if that means a more energetic delivery.",2
"Contents are good and interesting, but speakers' english is so low and bad (pronunciation) that the course becomes almost unpleasant.",2
"Most of the lectures were very rushed and brief. They quote facts and names and rarely bother to elaborate on them. The ""interviews"" that often serve as a second lecture for the week mostly repeat the first lecture /average duration for both - 5 minutes/Almost no reading materials in english.The translations in English isn't very good.The peer review processes for the final assignment is flawed, since you will be given to review works in spanish and english, with no option to""skip"" to an essay in a language you understand. The grading criteria is also flawed. For example the required length of the essay does not seem to be obligatory.The staff rarely bothers with answers in the discussion forumAll in all it is an interesting topic, and a good starting point for your own research. Sadly, It is one of the worst courses i have taken part in.",2
"There have been some undesirable references to equations, in terms of equating modeling to economic growth and investment. I was interested by the syllabus and its outline of theories and the means to use models to study social sciences and systems sciences. After week 1, though, it was not a very interesting course so I considered trying to simply survey most of the videos to gain some more information, not necessarily for any more insight from the Professor from the University of Michigan.",2
"The course lacks for the practice exersises. Instead, the quizes are full of questions like ""Present Simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well-known scientist. True or false"". The questions of this type are pointless. Still, the videos sometimes contain useful information.",2
"Could have more detail. This course feels rushed and skims over a lot of things without detailed explanation. The quizzes and peer assessments are poorly worded and confusing. Week 4 was excellent, Prof. Godefroid de Callatay's lectures about Magic in Islam were very well delivered and informative.",2
I feel there are many more topics to discuss for this course. I also feel that the topics discussed could be examined in further detail and at a slower pace. And there were times when the speaker was quiet or the microphone didn't work properly and I had a difficult time hearing what was being talked about.,2
"Not in-depth at all, mostly summarizes movie plots. If you're looking for a very light overview of some introductory psychological principles, this course is for you, otherwise, don't waste your time.",2
Short of content and engagement,2
"Interesting course material, but there were way too many mistakes in the exercise files. I felt we reached a low point when the only way to pass the assignments was to figure out what the instructor did wrong in the assignments, recreate those problems in my files, and then answer the questions ""correctly"" with the incorrect data. Really bad.",2
"The course has many mistakes, especially the quizzes solutions. The staff was not very active answering forum questions. In some way, I felt disappointed taking this course, because the quality is very poor in comparison to the other three courses of this specialization. However, I hope this review helps the staff to improve the quality of this course for future students, considering that the teacher has a great methodology to explain the content.",2
"The accent,presentation & stuttering is too cloudy & not suitable for foreigners",2
"There were several technical issues (no submission button for peer-reviewed assignment, right answers listed as wrong and vice versa in the clips, etc.). The lecturer also sounded a bit unnatural with pauses in sentences where you wouldn't expect them, making it harder to process information. The course material itself wasn't bad, but the execution just seemed a little unfinished.",2
"Hard getting through this course. It is probably because I don't have Adobe Lightroom software. Perhaps if I eventually get it, I will re-visit this course as the tutorials are thorough. I scored it as I did because I think the course title should have Lightroom & Pixlr in there since weeks 3 & 4 dominate those two.",2
"Actually a great class on a topic that is highly relevant in theory and practice alike. The problem of this class is mostly one assignment: The statement of problem set 3 is very unclear while the feedback from the grader is too little to improve anything. Forum didn't help either. Despite my arguably strong technical background I had to give up at this point since I simply cannot invest arbitrary amounts of time. Too bad for the rest of the course, which I was looking forward to a lot.",2
"Well structured in terms of content and the basic framework. But the delivery is dull. Yes, I know it is Phys Chem but I do think there must be ways to Jazz it up. Gave up after Week 6, so I cannot comment on the whole course.",2
"This course gives introduction of plenty of artworks from MoMA, but it will be more interesting if it shows more details and explanations about the artwork itself or the background of the time and the society.",2
Quiz was not well structured and title suggested a different idea than what the course was really about. Its a teachers guide.,2
"This course is solely for teachers, on how to tech art to elementary school pupils. Very basic. Most of the content is available on the MoMA's website. Disappointing.",2
"Nice idea, but too many technical difficulties. I tried to complete quiz 4 nine times and eventually passed the deadline. And in order to submit my final assignment I had to embedded my images into a word doc and export it as a PDF... I won't get extra marks for being able to work THAT out! ; )I did enjoy the rest of the course though. Thanks for all your efforts.",2
A really interesting course on a fascinating and often misunderstood topic. It could be vastly improved by doing away with the peer assignment review requirement.,2
"The concept of this course is unique and pretty interesting, but videos are too short, basic and non-specific, they have vague connection with the rest of the materials. And the design of the tests and assignment is just awful. The questions with multiple choice work wrong: marking all the right answers is not appropriate, you must choose the ""all of the above"" option, but it is wrong because of formal logic. The correct option here is only to match all the answers and the ""all of the above"" line. Also many questions are debatable, and there is no answers in the materials for the course. And, finally, the uploading of the last assignment was just impossible for more than a week, and I don't know if it will ever be possible. Bad experience.",2
"It was a very interesting course, however it was biased toward Spanish history with the inclusions. I was really more interested in what I thought the course was supposed to be about anyway, Medieval Manuscripts. I had a terrible time deciphering the lecturer's English and, because I'm not interested in a course certificate, the course projects were a waste of my time, though I can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course.",2
The videos didn't work correctly (sound and subtitles). I suggest to fix the problems because it is hard to understand the content of the course if the problems reamin.,2
Problem with quiz week 2,2
Very general information with too much dependance on the textbook for the course. You might as well just read the book.,2
"The teacher needs to improve her delivery. The quizzes are also useless. They don't really add to important information that we need to remember. Instead, the quizzes usually have questions that make you gofer for irrelevant info, made to test if you've gone through the reading. Honestly, I barely listened to the teacher's videos. It wasn't all that helpful nor engaging. We got all the info from the readings.",2
"Not as good as the other courses. I do wish another instructor could have done the videos. I had a very hard time staying with this course due to my frustration with instructor style of communicating. I felt like to much basic info about marketing especially traditional vs digital advertising. Most of us, get that. I don't know when I've struggled so hard to keep my attention and focus on the material. This specialization starts with a bang and ends very boring and outdated feeling.",2
"This is clearly not the right medium for Prof Clifton. This was inferior to the first installment, which had a great many problems on its own. Poor on camera delivery, lack of familiarity with the material and a tendency to just read the PPT slide on the screen are just a few of the problems. While the content is good you really have to work to get through the presentation of the material.",2
I did not like the teacher but I did like the course material.,2
"Super basic, nothing to be learnt there. No need to purchase the course, just go over the videos if you're new to digital.",2
"Disappointed by this class. Instructor and mentors added not value to course. The main reading ""eMarketing"" was good but all video content and assignments were directly from the ""eMarketing"" guide by Rob Stokes. Also ... they couldn't even get Rob Stokes name spelled correctly in the references.",2
"This ""planning"" course was slightly better than the preceding ""landscape"" course, but it was still underwhelming. The instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation, but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject. The course did touch on the important subject matters at hand, but since the textbook was so old (practically outdated by digital media standards), it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers. For example, the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot, Dynamics Marketing and Marketo and how CRMs like SalesForce and Dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy. Another example is how email marketing has moved to rules-based and triggered workflows. Again, there's a definite need for this course. I would actually recommend breaking out social, SEO and online advertising into their own courses, rather than squeezed into small segments. Finally, the ""putting it all together"" section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing, but the coverage here was much too general.",2
"I dropped on Week 5. There was just the required minimum for a MOOC. I did not find it engaging. Too bad, as I was genuinely curious of the topic.",2
Please we all have accents but i can not understand some words and makes it more difficult.,2
The lectures for this course lacked substance. The quizzes predominantly asked for verbatim recitation of the substance-free lectures.,2
"This course is a mess. Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (excellent starter) and before reading ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen). Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific: no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading ""Deep Learning"", its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos.",2
The course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation. Many quizzes had in-complete questions (no figures) and there was no corrections made. I had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions.,2
I learned a lot about deep learning. However the quiz contains several mistakes and I wasted many hours. I also thought explanation is unnecessarily hard to understand.,2
no mouse to highlight on slide when teachingIt's a lot of unclear parts in slideI think cs231 is better,2
"There is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly. Professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details. Quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult. The slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out. This is very indicative of the classes I had in college, where the class was ""here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and you'll be an expert"". There is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward). I'm sure Professor Hinton has contributed much to the field, but I suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories, not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so.",2
"Disappointing. The material is presented in such a way that it neither suits the mathematically inclined nor those interested a more hands-on introduction to neural networks. Some quizzes miss important figures and explanations, so that they can only be solved with the help of other students that have access to previous versions of the course.If this course should run for another session, the provider (University of Toronto) should decide on the proper audience and should also considerably revise the course. Given the flaws with the current session, it seems that the provider just wants to reap some easy money from students attracted by a current and interesting topic an a well-known name (Geoffrey Hinton).",2
"There are some problems of the organization of the course. Some conditions and some images are missing in quizzes. Even some videos are missing. There's no official response in the forum. Thanks to the responses of other students in the forum, i can finally do some of the quizzes. It's really frustrating.",2
"Good course, but severely hobbled by the transition to the new platform. Many technical issues in the quizzes (such as questions not showing up, being marked incorrectly). Leaves the student feeling somewhat forgotten, which is a shame considering the brilliant material being presented.",2
"The course was ported to the new Coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing. Learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments, and they are still not fixed. The content is generally interesting, but not presented in a cohesive way. Many concepts are juggled with without giving clear, mathematical definitions.",2
"I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera. In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well. Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture. I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less. I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it. I much preferred Andrew Ng's course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first. I am also loving the University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization, but since I have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while, I did Hinton's course in the mean time. That said, I did find this course useful, although I often felt somewhat frustrated.",2
"This course could've been better by the inclusion of more examples, the lecturer is very monotonous and sadly, i see no discussion forum for this course, in addition to that, whenever i tried replying to the comments the reply button turned grey and nothing happened. I had reported to resolve the issue but nothing happened the issue persists. It could have been done much better specially the lectures. Thank you :)",2
The course was hard to follow and understand.,2
For me personally: way to complex and brain rather than output focused,2
"Not particularly engaging. Some significant overlaps in content on the videos. Some rambling videos that could really do with editing. I liked that the content within the main lecture was concise - it really needed to be because the lecturer has very little variety to his tone of speech - listening requires ""high cognitive load"". Don't want to be too down on it because I really appreciate the free content and the subject material is very interesting, but it could do with a bit more love and the practical application of the marketing concepts described in the course. Maybe start with some eye-tracking on someone completing the course?!",2
I honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general. It also seemed to be full of self - congratulations about what UPENN has accomplished with its research. I wanted more depth in a more targeted approach to improving my life.,2
"I would not recommend this course. The content is very relevant to the subject matter. However, the lectures are much longer than they need to be, and filled with unnecessary commentary. The instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself. The delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk-through of the equation at hand.",2
"I give 5 star for the teacher, really approach having such a well-organized teaching material.I also give -1 star for the homework assignment and its (almost) GraphLab only approach. Yes, it mentioned ""alternative"" approach (which is much more popular than GraphLab), but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through. With scikit-learn as a great open source package, the only reason (I suspect) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose. For me, if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas, I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn; but now, it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly. I like to get a certificate, but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time.",2
"This course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic, domestically and globally. The accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical. Also, one of the required videos proved helpful, and a couple of the optional Ted talks were ""must see's"" for anyone involved in the non-profit sector.It was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus. In fact, one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video, extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located. Another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book. (There was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview, but for the most part, I felt as though I was watching an infomercial.) Requests for help fell on deaf ears, except for those of co-learners.A small, but annoying, flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides, for the video component of the course--with an additional word thrown in, on occasion, for good measure. It would have been less distracting just to have the slides to read.I wish this course had been designed and taught to the standards I have come to expect from Coursera courses. It could have been one of the most valuable yet.",2
"Con:(1) I feel I spent most of the time learning graphlab. Suggest replace it with standard Python as the standard tool for this class. Provide any needed additional code in standard Python.(2) Course is better in the front end than in the back end.(3) Week #6 is significantly more involved than previous weeks. Suggest divide Week 6 into two sessions: Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor applying neural network results (ImageNet 2012 was mentioned and not explained. Therefore the Nearest Neighbor homework assignment from the student's perspective does not have much to do with neural network other than using the results from ImageNet 2012, which was not explained in any detail anyway). This will allow more time to delve into the forward and backward propagation which should have been explained in more details.(4) Home assignments are not best worded, especially homework assignment for Week 6. Suggest reword in shorter statements that are more to the point.(5) Programming presentation and assignments can seem like exercise in graphlab and SFrame functions rather than machine learning.PRO:(1) Class presentation by Professor Fox on recommender system is detailed and clear.(2) Classifier block diagram shown by Professor Guestrin is good, clearly distinguishing training the classifier and the subsequent use of the classification (prediction).(3) Neural network quiz in Week 6 is excellent. It drills down on the multi-dimensional space that neural network is particularly good for.",2
"Very good course material. However, Graphlab is no longer free to use for commercial purpose.",2
TBH this class's experience is not good. The lecturers seem unprepared and they talk very repetitively.,2
excessive use of GraphLab create which is not an industry standard.,2
"The content of this course is interesting, I liked the examples, and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning. From that perspective, the course is as advertised. But, where this course goes wrong is value for money - it is very superficial and not worth what is charged.As noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructor's own pay software and their other Coursera courses. I'm not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous. In my case I thankfully started with the free model so I didn't lose out, but I could see others being dissapointed. I strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra grading.My other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course. I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so I'll live with that level of detail. The material covered, however, does not need 6 weeks worth of lectures. This course could be ~1/2 as long, cover the same material, and be a MUCH better course.Other small problems include some poorly edit videos (there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the videos that should have meant they do another take), very short videos (maybe a person preference, but the number of <2 minute videos here is annoying, especially when there's a 5-second standard video at the start and end of all videos). All in all, there's just a lot of wasted time.When signing up for this course I was really excited for the entire specialization - now, not so much. I'll probably try the second course in the series (for free to start) to see if things improve, but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products.",2
The subjectes are not learnt deeply and precisely. Too summarized and vague!,2
"Good course! The only major drawback is the requirement of Graphlab, which doesnt allow the student to fully understand the applications using real world software. Just recently, Dato (the company that owns graphlab) was purchased by Apple, and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software. Despite this, users cannot use Graphlab for commercial purposes, therefore rendering the software completely impractical for professionals. The specialization is designed to help you get a job (see capstone) yet the software currently in place is limiting.",2
"I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area, as well as great machine learning enthusiasts. However, I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and (very!) expensive platform, mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning. Ok, the platform offered makes things easier, but if you really want to learn machine learning, you can not be limited to a platform, acting as a robot just using pre-written functions in a black box.",2
"I like the case-based approach--this course gives a nice albeit shallow overview. I don't like that one professor uses this course to push his startup by asking students to use graphlab. A more commonly used library would have been a much better choice. Parts of the course feel like a ""Getting started with Graphlab"" tutorial.",2
"I can only infer that this course's target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities. Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples, watching the videos at 2x speed.The course itself is incredibly shallow, even for a survey course, and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors' own products -- Graphlab Create. You'll be much better off taking Andrew Ng's course, which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library.The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab.",2
"I'm sorry, but this is just ridiculous. I can't recommend this course to anyone. It's all about advertizing: Emily Fox can't stop but recommend Amazon services, and Carlos Guestrin does the same for his Dato's Graphlab Create, which is might be great in general, but absolutely useless in educational purposes. The practice part of every week is just a waste of the time.I can't say ""money well spent"".",2
"The teachers are easy to like, but the course content is very lightweight and will mostly teach you terminology with no real understanding.The worst part was the assignments, which could all be solved by a little copy/paste: I didn't learn anything useful by doing them. All the actual algorithms were supplied in a separate module. More than that, many of the suggested solutions were bad coding (like collapsing 50% of the data before training, or writing sixteen special cases rather than a general function) or pointless (like training a linear classifier on pixel data).There are better courses out there.",2
"The overall quality of the course is good, but in my opinion the level is quite low and there is less content then I expected. The assignments are more or less copy-paste or very repetitive. The 5-8 hour work per week are a joke, I never needed more than 2.5h per week.",2
"One would learn a thing or two, but the course is very sparse compared to other machine learning courses, and I didn't feel that it was worth the time and the cost.",2
"The course uses proprietary tools for machine learning and data manipulation, making it effectively useless! However, the material on describing the machine learning algorithms were excellent!",2
Poorly executed. Constant differences in data. tiresome to watch two supposedly very intelligent instructors amuse themselves by saying Bro and Dude. The use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit. Probably a lot of better executed Machine Learning courses out there,2
"As a non programer, or mathematician, this course is too hard to follow.",2
"2 stars because the theoretical part is ok but programming assignments are waste of time. I'm not here (and paid) to be trained to use something the instructor is trying to SELL, nor will I ever recommend this product for commercial use. I will switch to other ""not recommended"" packages in the later parts of this specialization.They should put the disclaimer for Graphlab Create in the specialization page so people can be aware of this.Besides, the sound of that Giraffe toy is really, really annoying.",2
"Instructors or TAs are not available in discussion forums. and the course is focussed on promoting ""graph lab"" proprietary package of the course sponsor. Maybe you can have a look, not beneficial if you are serious about learning ML.",2
LIKE an advertisment!Why not use pandas and numpy sk-learn?Open source is more popular!,2
This course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanics of machine learning.,2
"Having done some other machine learning MOOCS , this course seemed rather basic to me and did not enjoy too much using non open-source software for the programming assignments. The material is nice, In this sense, I would have expected to 'default' to sci-kit learn and offer using graphlab create as optional.",2
"Even though the course discusses relevant topics, the level is extremely low: The lab sessions were easily solved applying copy-paste code from the provided notebooks, with minor adaptions. Moreover, 8/10 questions in the lab sessions were not related to machine learning at all, but simply looping over data and counting or similar. The intro video and course introduction strongly suggested using deep learning in the course: did not happen. We trained k-means on pre-computed features which happened to come from from a deep learning network (not sure which one, inception? I didn't even watch the lectures here from disappointment). That is not deep learning, it just shows you how well deep learning can work.Graphlab is a mature framework, I guess, but it's commercial and scikit-learn is better imho (and free!).If you wish to learn machine learning, take the Stanford course on Machine Learning for Andrew Ng. This course is in MATLAB, not ideal for machine learning, but adequate for a better understanding of intelligent system implementations.Maybe the course is OK if you're a beginner in machine learning, but not good.",2
"I didn't like the python environment, I thought it will be more like Ng's course. Nice explanations, but for amateurs.",2
"The framework is ok, but it would be more insight on the functions would be much more amplifying the learning process.Good working examples, though!",2
"The case study approach is a great idea.But I wish the instructors were more candid about the tools that were in use. It seems dodgy that the instructor is a CEO of a commercial tool vendor and is ""encouraging"" students to use it.The quizzes in the course were extremely shallow.",2
It really just touches a lot on different machine learning techniques and really just sets the stage for the higher courses. Unfortunately some of the chapters (especially deep learning) are so brief that it is really frustrating trying to complete the quiz and assignment. Also the course doesn't use open source tools but a trial version of a pretty expensive library.,2
"Very, very high altitude introduction presented in a seemingly confused way with a lot of product placement.",2
"Course doesn't do nearly enough to bring you up to speed on using mathlab or iPython notebook. I am currently learning to program python and a lot of this stuff was well above my head.The quizzes and assignments do very little to reinforce the work, and often come down to trial and error. I wanted to learn the mechanics of machine learning from this course, but it is too complex, and presented in such an arcane manner to serve as an introduction, but doesn't go deep enough to really teach anything useful. I'd suggest you look at Wikipedia or YouTube for better classes.I'd like to draw special attention to the quizzes, as often they're on trivia from the lectures and not reflective of the actual nuts and bolts of working with machine learning. They, as with the projects, I found to be a massive waste of my time.",2
I do not like this course being tied to a commercial product. In my opinion it should be using an open source python library and not focusing on the Dato product.,2
Due to many technical issues with GraphLab lib I have to reduce acitivity in this curse for only video viewing :(.,2
it's rather a course on using API of proprietary software with very very basic background on the actual math underneath,2
"This course (as the previous one) needs some improvements. First learning only relying on videos is not very effective. There are no lecture slides neither consistent addtional resources to grasp seriously the materials. Also the way quizzes are designed is not - in my opinion, very well planned. The videos alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quizzes. Also - again in my opinion, I didn't saw a consistent approach to the materials, neither the examples given made any sense. In the last video, there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savoir relier approach, but in contrast the videos and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche, use the HEC MBA program as example. I simply don't see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison. I think you should reflect on this.",2
I wish the Chinese characters were provided for all the vocabulary and example sentences taught,2
I think with more listen exercises this course will be better and the length of the videos too short.,2
"Very basic, we need sequels",2
"This teacher reminds me of old aunties that tried to tell me how to think. ""That's just the way it is"" is never a good reason for me.",2
"I am giving it a 2 and am leaving the course because several of the recordings in the second quiz don't work. It is not possible to participate when there are technical difficulties like this. If the recordings worked, I am sure it would be a very fun and interesting class.",2
the classes are sometimes extremely boring and some things are not clearly explained,2
I thought she was a nice Teacher but Didn't teach the Basics steps into speaking & learning chinese .If she had started with ABC alphabet how to write & speak the first week then taught to sound each letter out in different pitches of volume 2week then to sentences building 3rd week so on .it would had been much more helpful I believe ...I sad that i had to leave the course b/c it seem and look like a great obertonty ... but it went to fast didn't cover what i Expected it would.. :(,2
A submission too complicate to learn chinese-Three submission is too reasonable.,2
"The whole course is basically a short topic based phrasebook being read-out and over-explained in English. Since I already speak English, this isn't very useful. The course contains no dialogues, or any real situations where vocab's being reviewed. I found the exercise nitpicky and confusing, and there's no indication nor review of what actually you did wrong. Better just use an audio-phrasebook and repeat it using the same time.",2
"The lessons are sometimes completely disconected from the graded assignments. There were some graded assignements that dealt with things I have never heard about and I completed it without even looking the lessons videos. Some of the lessons are disapointing of the lack of assistance to the required software/code to be used. In such a way that the concept worked is very simple, but if you have no experience on the software or code you can have a hard time to complete the assignements with irritating details which are not explained at all in the lessons. The lessons serves more as a guide to what you should search in google and learn through other source of information. I did not expected such poor course from a paid one; I have doen free courses way better than this course. Don´t pay or this course, find some other course free or other paid course with better reviews.",2
The course is good. But it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.,2
"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",2
"This course probably deserves 3-4 stars in a better, maintained form, but the entire specialization is not maintained, the lectures have no production values. Basically, it's a money pit that Coursera is keeping up cynically. It's a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists' skills.",2
"Do not like the slides and the way it is explained. Compared with other ML courses on cousera, this one makes me feel that it is more like a handbook/dictionary instead of a tutorial to teach students. If you already know it, it would help you refresh the mind. Otherwise, you might find it is just to show off how how complex and mysterious is the data science.",2
Unrelated and incohesive lectures. Disappointed. Lots of random topics talked about .but nothing in depth.,2
"Positive: There are a lot of examples and interviews with people in the field that help to understand better. I think the concepts exposed are useful and relevant.Negative: I think it the course could be done in a much more compact way (the introduction and conclusion of each video, which is just music, take together around half a minute). I think all the concepts could be introduced in half of the time. There is a lot of reiteration and some texts are so similar with one another that more than once I thought I was doing again the same section.",2
"First: University of Pennsylvania and we still have to deal with a heavy accent?Second: Couldn't tell if all the vocab gone over repeatedly was standard or made up by the prof.Third: Stilted, repetitive and boring teaching style.",2
"While the lectures were good, one of the mentors wasn't profesional at all, she was nasty, though the other one was very fine.But my chief complaint is the terrible method (in creative writing classes only ?) of using peer reviews to pass the class. I had a non-English-speaking person NOT pass me, a former English teacher, for no other reason than he misread the assignment. So I had to resubmit. I don't know who finally passed me, I think the peer review process is a shambles, and it lets Coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me. I don't think I will be taking creative writing classes again at Coursera, as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasn't worth my time and anxiety.",2
"Designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time. Some of the facts about poetry aren't accurate. The effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material. The time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching, but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toddler. I did not finish this class as I couldn't stand the videos.",2
Clearly the target audience is a younger and newer Poet. I learned some new terms and enjoyed some new Poetry. Overall it was just okay.,2
"One suggestion i give to you that, please level of difficulty increase in a way that the learner not face to much thing in a single assignment. So, create assignment like that learner learn less thing but accurately. For example in this assignment you only build a relations between classes and marker on a map for only CityMarkerMap.java class and in the next module you implement LandMarker.java and so on. So, please this is my request in the future make assignments in a way that the Learner less thing but efficiently and accurately.",2
too fancy and the structure is not very clear. Not very much learned.,2
The peer review assignment part is reallyuseless.,2
"While the material is relevant, the exercises required too much specific knowledge that was not discussed in lecture. For an experienced programmer, most of the exercises were easy, but I admit I had to look ahead on two of the projects because the instructions were too lacking. The final project was too open ended and made me not want to finish this course.Overall, I would not recommend this course.",2
"The lectures were too wordy and the lecturers tripped over their words too often (which wouldn't have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadn't been so wordy!). There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time. This felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.Also, the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other Coursera courses.",2
If you think this is an introduction to Java programming language you are wrong.What do you want? Do you want teach us to use Processing or teach us to program in Java?,2
"Bad or superficial explanations. The instructor speaks very fast and you need to continually stop the video to keep the pace. Some interesting commands and are shown, but the instructor seems to be tired of explaining them and defers explanations to lots of links at the end of each video.",2
Nice course but the peer assignment is awful.,2
This course expects you to have a lot more ground for an intermediate course.,2
I wish the teachers would go more into how to come up with solutions to the functional problems.,2
"The actual educational aspects of the course are interesting and insightful but the requirement to grade the work of others makes this course a chore to get through. If the material wasn't so useful, I would have rated this course 1/5. If the peer review requirement did not exist, it would easily have warranted a 5/5 rating.",2
Too little content for the price.,2
"you have access to the material, but you have to pay 80 USD to take simple quizzes....",2
"Aside from a new interesting ideas (from a JFK speech and John Dewey), I found this course to be stretched pretty thin; I think this class would have been effective as a 2 or 3 week course instead of 9 weeks. Also, it was unclear why the focus was on CLASSICAL music, since so many examples come from other artforms (e.g., Ai Wei Wei) and I'm sure the discussions would be richer if they considered popular music as well.",2
"A pure misapprehension it was. The course involved many interesting conceptions (like how modern conceptions of civil society differ from Hegel’s) and discussions of many really worthy persons (like Pablo Casals, Bronisław Huberman, or Ai Weiwei) but did not pertain music as such. Mere two peer reviewers per submission turned peer reviewing into a kind of lottery.",2
"Difficult to understand the professor, and slides were hard to read",2
Not as detailed or practical as I hoped for.,2
"Slow, never to the point, repetitive, presentation and communication outdated. This class is a text high schooler student's nightmare almost to the point to be an homage to the boring economic class at the beginning of "" Ferris Bueller's Day Off ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA",2
"The subject of this course is awesome and very interesting. But the effort that Berklee put into it is nothing compared to what they give to students, on their official website. I completed a Certificate with Berklee online and I do not recommend this course - but I do recommend Berklee Online courses, with written lessons and interactive works!P.s.: the videos stop all the time and this makes it harder to follow what the teacher is saying!",2
"The lectures are good, but in the assignments he asks for tasks that are not at all explained in the videos. For a beginner's course it is way too difficult and time consuming.",2
It seems like the course loses its focus about on-half of the way through. It stops being about music and suddenly becomes a discussion about liberal social issues. I completely lost interest in it at that point.,2
Good course....but way out of my depth! Too mathematical for my liking; would have preferred more balance to this course!! None of us are going to calculate things to such an extent....,2
not very explanatory,2
"Very good course material. However, Graphlab is no longer free to use for commercial purpose.",2
"I'm a statistician, not a programmer. There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (I'm referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language.If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot. On other occasions, the question actually specifies to use the model from (3), whereas it actually wants you to use the model from (4) instead to get the correct answer. This course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimized.",2
"There are two frustrations with this iteration of the series. One: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded. Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly. If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that. Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration. Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit. Not enough to justify the increasing frustration I was feeling toward the end of this course. I have no intention of taking any more at this point, not from these authors.",2
"Pace is extremely slow. The instructor writes and talks simultaneously. The words are put so slow that it puts me off too sleep at times. I love taking courses where the instructor speaks at the right pace and keeps you involved. Carlos, the co instructor. One of the perfect MOOC is Calculus One by Jim Fowler",2
2nd time trying this. Hard to understand subject. Short class.,2
"While the content (common predictive regression and classification algorithms and tools like XLMiner) was useful, little to no support was provided in the forums. The assignments in Week 3 and Week 4 in particular were either vague or had errors that nobody double checked and course-takers had to use trial and error approach to get answers right.",2
This teacher is an amateur.,2
This course is NOT free to submit test results.,2
Primarily focused on US politics and the US policy system. Discusses mostly the problems with the US system of governance and it therefore not really useful for international viewers.,2
"This is the third Coursera course I have completed. I am nearing completion on two others. I had high expectations for this one but it was the only one I have been disappointed in. In comparison with other MOOCs I've participated in which have clearly been designed with online delivery and audience in mind, the format of this MOOC was not engaging. It's also baffling that they would spend nine weeks on public policy in the 21st century and only include one female speaker and not a single person of colour. The 21st century at the University of Virginia must look quite different from the 21st century where I am. There was also a lot institutional promoting of the University of Virginia / Batten School itself which I haven't experienced in other courses. While I did find some of the speakers and subject matter to be of interest, I had hoped for more from this MOOC.",2
"This class would do well to have supplemental or required readings and much more difficult quizzes. I think it would be possible to have one's wisdom teeth removed and complete this course on a binge-watching spree while on pain killers. That shouldn't be possible. Good lecturers, though.",2
Instructor mostly reads off the slides. Some explanations are too short. Can't connect on any level with the instructor.2 stars is for the course content.,2
"It is very well designed for total beginner of programming. But if you learned any language already, it is too too too easy.",2
"This course is a first time programming class using Python. This is not what I was looking for. I wanted an introduction to Python for someone who knows a some programming already. Also, this teaches Python 2, which no longer cuts it, especially for an intro class where you'll be taking further work. It may have made sense when this class was done 3 years ago. It does not now.The teacher was very lively and engaging, and I would enthusiastically recommend taking an online class with him, but the class is out of date and not what I was looking for.",2
very essential,2
"Not that good if you have experience with other programming languages.It's waste of time and money, you should take it as audit.",2
"This course hasn't been upgraded to Python 3. I've been following along using Python 3 code myself, but it's 2017, and Python 2 reaches End of Life in 3 years at 2020.",2
"The course material is fine. In fact its good. However I completed the entire course in 4 hours. Whilst I have some basic programming experience I am by no means an expert. There really is very very little material in this course. The assignments are also very simple and automatically graded. The course fees are not particularly transparent. I think the course is FAR too expensive for the content provided. All of the other reviews I have seen for this course are a single line such as 'I liked the course a lot' or something equally vacuous and unhelpful. If you are a beginner I would suggest trying 'Python for the absolute beginner' by Michael Dawson. If you have ANY programming experience, you might be better with a more advanced course.",2
It is too basic. Boring if you have ever programmed before. I would enclose the full content of this course into a week as part of the second course.,2
Too easy and full of straw (meaning thing not needed),2
all this course justified one class at top.,2
All the lectures are not clearly explained and a fresh person cannot understand few things and even in the assignments not mentioned properly what has to be done and if not how to solve them and how can you imagine the learner knows all the terms related to web or the particular language..? you need to explain the new terms which you use in the lectures and the lectures should be elaborate and should stress more on the basic things like abcdefg here you need to explain a in detail b in detail c in detail so on then after in the next lectures you can move fastly.Not satisfied.,2
"Extremely basic. I wouldn't even call this a full course. It's about half of an introductory course. I assume the pacing is to allow for people that may have difficulty with learning the language. I'm not certain that it has the depth necessary for those that may have difficulty though. If you are at all serious about learning to program, don't limit yourself to this course, or it's pacing. I would suggest researching every subject covered, to get a bit more depth, and moving through it at a brisk pace. If you take the pace suggested in the course, you're likely to have bought a new computer before you can program anything extremely useful.",2
"Useless Quiz and not enough Challenge CodingDatacamp or codeacademy do a better jobOnly for absolute beginners(Others please try something else, you will waste your time learning nothing)",2
"Not the greatest Python course in the world. Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized, technical issues are common, and the discussion forums do not offer much value, as you cannot discuss your code with your peers, and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful. The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it's enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around! You're better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform, as well as on other platforms. The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python, but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging.",2
"Its too easy. The exercises and quizzes are too simple to solve. Once can easily read 4-5 chapters from book in a single day and can complete this course. I feel that the duration (5weeks) for this course is way too long. The concepts discussed could have been easily understood in 3 weeks (at max). Also, I think the fees is high for such trivial concepts.",2
"Sense of humour is off-putting. Tone is unnecessarily childish (""Python is yelling at you""). Key ideas are unmotivated (just trust me, functions are useful!). Includes line of code impossible to understand in earlier videos (e.g. loops appear in earlier weeks). Office hours just seem like professor showing off all the places he goes to. I enjoyed the interviews with people discussing their work or history.",2
Material is very basic for anyone with even the smallest amount of programming experience. Very slow pace,2
I think that this course was too basic.,2
Too expensive to be that simple.,2
too easy for cs major.,2
The videos ramble too much which makes it hard to really dig into the material.,2
The pace is two slow.,2
"Far too easy and too expensive. I did this ""seven week"" course in about 2 hours. I can get much more thorough instruction from Code Academy for free or low cost.",2
"Too easy, even though I understand it's the first course of the series. But, great professor!",2
It was too easy and very basic. Not challenging enough. but maybe I wasn't the right student for the class. The lectures are too slow and repetitive too.,2
this course is suitable for beginning,2
I knew R and was looking for an intro to Python. If you already know some programming this class is too basic.,2
"Sorry, the professor has a genial & cheerful personality, but the program material is just too basic, and it takes forever to wade through it all. I will enrol in more advanced courses. My mistake, not yours, thanks for the opportunity.",2
An ambitious sweep across the NLP landscape. Requires at least intermediate knowledge of Python; especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills. Exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point.,2
"The content is important and the course goes through a great extension of the NLP topics but the methodology is bad. The video lectures are often overcharged with many different varieties of a processing method that is not well explained. The quiz are often not well related to the lecture and the assignments are badly explained and there's no much documentation related to them. Comparing to Andrew's ML course, this one is really bad.",2
"After about week 6, helpfulness decreased quite a lot..",2
"I don't have the impression that much effort was invested in this class to present natural language processing as introductory as possible for beginners in this field, i.e. someone who not necessarily has a background in computational linguistics.",2
"The assignments were not well supported by the lecture material, which were much to shallow. I guess an Intro level course is going to be broad and shallow, but if you are going to have assignments that require implementation then that should be better supported by the material. And don't even get me started on the final...",2
Content is not well adapted to a digital format.,2
"This course SEEMS to be a great course. But personally I think it's not.It talks about so many things but none of them are explained clearly. I can't get the picture of this field clearly.The assignment looks nice. But it's not. First, it's not well-organized. Sometimes you need to look at next week's course to do this week's quiz. The programming assignment is VERY VERY unsatisfying. It's not explained clearly; there's no helpful instruction; and it is very confusing. You need to spend hours and hours just UNDERSTANDING what you need to do. And some algorithms are not even told in the course and you need to implement them! I know this could be a good exercise but I would hope it at least provide some useful resources.Generally, I am very disappointed. I feel like I'm spending hours and hours but learning nothing. Just confusion. Please consider reformat the homework; make it more doable for new learners in this field.",2
"Initially, I was excited about this course, but I lost interest due to two things. First, while the beginning segments about how we know the Presocratics was great, the presentation of the early Milesians was shallow and did not deepen my understanding of their world and thought. Then, the section on Parmenides made me lose faith in the teacher - she presented his main ideas in such a way as to obscure his vision, which is of what we now call a multiverse, a world in which all things exist potentially. The best part of the course was that it made me seek out other writers about Parmenides.",2
"Lecture videos were fantastic! Instructor was amazing. I have a big problem with the final project in Week 5. The entire courses was focused on statistics, yet the final project was focused on R. I wish I had prior R knowledge before starting this course, yet on the front page it says it's a beginner specialization. I would recommend learning R and ggplot before this course. It will make the course a lot less frustrating!",2
"This course will teach you a little bit of statistics and leave you confused with R. The first four weeks are very straightforward. They give R code for everything. However, this is not good because it does not prepare you well for the last project in which you have to do the whole project using R. This is almost like learning how to cook without knowing how to use a knife.",2
Not very engaging. I ended up just reading the notes as videos were slow and took too much time. Not enough pathophysiology or treatment details for me as a healthcare provider. Disappointed after taking a previous course which was wonderful...student conversations and dialogue from around the world.,2
This course was heavy on data and light on implications and course corrections. It would have been more helpful to outline the types of behaviors that make an individual fall into a specific category socially and how to change what your currently do to enhance your social likability.,2
"very basic, tool based solutions, no real content behind.Usually these courses are about learning and being mentally challenged not getting a toolbox.",2
this course needs much more evidences and examples to support the valuable information.,2
"the course is theoretical, it would be better with more examples and case studies.",2
introductory course,2
The course is well organized but I don't think it covered all the basics.,2
Boring,2
"The course material was quite boring. I have gained some theoretical knowledge about problem solving and decision making techniques, but we weren't given enough practical examples on how we should apply these techniques at work. I wish the lecturer had t suggested additional material on the topic.",2
"Very brief , some points are leaved without explanation",2
"The course really isn't that useful for day to day management decision making. It might be more useful for those who look solely at long term data and make choices ""at a distance"" so to speak. Very heavy focus on charts and graphs....so there's a lot to it but very little you can sink your teeth into unless you have a very specific type of management in mind.",2
"Theoretically good course, could have been made more interesting by including more examples or cae studies.",2
Somehow simple presentations.,2
"In my point of view the course overall is a bit superficial (even though the decision-making part was very interesting indeed). More importantly, the course lacks one of the richest tools in MOOCS: peer interactions - people voicing their opinions and sharing experiences.Besides that: some of the questions in the quiz looked very ambiguous and there are some editing mistakes in the videos.",2
"Doesn't go much further then common sense. Introduces terms for concepts you probably know, just didn't know it's a concept. The lecturer is terrible. His stories, or i guess metaphors that are supposed to help you understand and remember things are aweful. He takes way too long to get the point across.Some helpful things are mentioned. Gives you the ability to distiguish problem solving methods, so you may use them as required.Nonetheless, mostly wasted my time watching this.",2
Great first starter but poorly done,2
The course was very basic. I don't think I have learned anything new.,2
It is more likely a microscopic level of mos description. For me i like to have a devise design perspective on the MOS components .,2
The course need more improvement in the case of videos and always updates,2
Very basic overview of personal branding.,2
The videos were not very professional.Depth of the subject was not there.Very introductory and generic course where personal branding as a subject was merely cursorily touched.,2
For me this is too artificial.,2
Very basic.,2
"The first course I was really dissappointed with. It came of as very subjective, unscientific and I could not take it seriously. Coursera usually has more credible courses.",2
"The backbone of the course was useful, but I thought the lectures were lacking depth. The quizzes were way too easy, you didn't even need to follow the course to be able to pass it.The extra articles and links were one of the highlights.",2
Its a good practical lecture but I think it have lots of room to improve. The material itself can be covered in 2 weeks lecture.,2
"Very basic, no new material or ideas if you've been interested in the subject for a while, but it might give you a fresh perspective on how to present some subjects to your audience.",2
The topics are of interest however the course content could be presented better. In most instances it is hard to predict where the instructor is writing and is hard to read. Also writes over the slide material.,2
The material is OK but the grading is terrible. Most of the grades are for peer reviews which depending on other students may never be completed particularly if your first try isn't perfect and you need to resubmit. I would not pay for the course until I had passed peer review as odds are you never will.,2
"I base my ratings of courses on 3 things:1) Is the material clear? 3/5Yes, for the most part, though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like ""class"" / ""object"" the wrong way.2) Can I generalize from the material to other applications? 2/5This module spends a lot of time on C before you get to Objective-C specific material, so you don't get much Objective-C. There's a bit of a tour of XCode, but it's not particularly comprehensive. The apps you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/5This course is super boring. If you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you don't know C this is not a good way to pick it up.So overall 2/5One other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way. You have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission. In return, you have to review three other people's videos. Sort of a rolling homework Ponzi scheme. This strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon!",2
"There are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies. Slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value. The course is not compelling in any way. Too many references to a book said to be not compulsory.In the final exam right answers are not given.The course gives you just a smattering of the subject, nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job.",2
"The course is not interactive enough, it's a waterfall of dry information. I'd expected more based on the generally good reviews. Say, more examples, better videos. Think twice before buying.",2
"Despite having high quality contents, the quantity wasn't as much as I expected. The number of videos could be a lot more.",2
"I found this course disappointing. Whilst the presenter, Margaret Meloni, was enthusiastic and pleasant to listen to, the content was very sparse indeed. A large part of the content each week was simply reading a presentation which you could get from a book. I would expect an online course to be more interactive, have more videos, and more varied content. I found the case studies (where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision) useful - there was one of these per week when I think there could have been more, perhaps three a week. The course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments. This would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them.",2
"I felt the initial splash screen was a bit time consuming, also lot of the knowledge felt like more bookish. Could have been different styles of management and approaches or even how leaders in the past like Dale Carneige would have approached. This course has a lot of potential and I feel revising the next version would make it so much better for novice program managers",2
"The flash tutorials are helpful. Instructor quality is low, production quality of instructor videos is low. Not on par with the University of Virginia project management course. Pace of course is also extremely slow, though it may be appropriate for novice students. That should be made clear up-front in the course description.",2
"Good as overview, but pretty shallow. Only some slides to read through, no real exercises but constant reference to the standard project management book. Pretty fast click-through as start into project management.",2
"Some good concepts and stories, but lacking in specific techniques.",2
"I have mixed feelings about this course. I notice that a lot of courses like these in US colleges are incredibly glorified. The professor sounds knowledgeable, I have to admit. The material, however, seems mostly like common sense. Most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time. Just like business courses, people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever. Also, very boring.",2
"Profoundly knowledgeable, but very soft spoken Professor - was difficult to maintain interest and energy especially in this remote learning medium.Decided to table this course for a while and revisit when my learning attitude is calmer and more in-line with his communication style.",2
"Good context, however, long videos, didn’t catch my attention.",2
"Wasn""t great. I didnt find the tests great",2
"I thought the instructor was very well organized, and knowledgeable. However, the information I received, at times, appeared more descriptive than informative. What I mean, is that I feel that we were told a lot about how things are, and very little about what to do. Overall, great instructor, I had expected more ""strategy"" and ""guidance.""",2
"Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.",2
Repetitive and stating the obvious from all sorts of angles. But this may be usual for business classes.,2
"Unfortunately, didn`t enjoy this course at all. I have gone through 7 courses on Coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results. This time I had to leave the course before finishing because:1st: content is organized awfully (for example ""HTML overview"" - I knew all the material so I have an idea how it should look like, but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts, than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlinked content. I have simply lost a logic inside this.2nd: Very difficult to get an idea: lecturer doesn`t try to simplify the content, even opposite - I had a feeling, that he makes easy things complicated for a reason. My husbend is a programmer with 10 years experience and when he watched the lecture he said, that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing (things he actually knows). All these terms used, no relevant examples, too complex words and so on - I lost concentration, I had to google a lot of unknown terms, I had to stop lecture every 30 seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture, because I could not understand it. As I mentioned, I know HTML well, but it was described so complex, that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer words.3rd: not international student friendly. Use of complex words in places where they were not necessary, complex structures, too fast language... I am pretty good in English, but had to stop video and to google translate some ""smart"" words lecturer used without particular need - I don`t mean definitions, just some epithets to make his speech ""smarter"". I completed Coursera specialization by Michigan University and it was completely easy with plain text, short sentences, so well made for international student.4th: this is boring. I am sorry, but this is true. I am interested in all these questions, but for some reasons I lose my attention every time. Maybe the reason is in all points I have just mentioned, but I didn`t enjoy this course at all and it was the first time I didn`t enjoy something connected with web app development. Please, don`t be mad at me - lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person, but I simply don`t like how the material is presented.5th: I have a feeling like all slides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles, it is not like described with own words, simplified for better comprehension, cleared with own real-life examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humor.Please, take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more.",2
Unable to download certain materials and no spontaneous reply was made,2
The course is very hard due to the difficulty of the explanation. The course has a lot of points to cover with few explanation,2
"I wish I could rate this course higher but I didn't enjoy it and despite being 10/12 weeks into it, I'm going to stop now. The videos are hard to follow, the examples are few and far in between, some explanations (eg. exchange rates) are really poorly explained. I'm disappointed, I don't feel like I learned much!",2
Too much contents in short lectures. Hard to catch up and to understand.The tests after each class are poorly designed. Most correct answers are the first choices.,2
i can't see the course teacher so it look like the all parts of course are the same,2
"I just finished this course. I want to give a frank feedback since I see a lot of untapped possibilities in this course. On the strengths, it began with a high note and got me glued with expectations and promises. The instructor sounded extremely comfortable and confident with her subject, and had a very calming and pleasant presence which helped establish a kind of ""remote"" trust. On the improvement areas, I however have a few to list. For one, the intensity, rigour and to-the-pointedness of the content sharply fell after the first week. Having known about mindfulness, Metta meditations, gratitude, it became personally disappointing to me how this course conveyed so little about them and impacted so less than can be possible with the time and space alloted. The framework which initially looked hopeful is perhaps not the best framework, as much as is said about this not being ""spectator course"". Because this format diluted the intensity and possibility of the course, making it drag and bore towards the end. I wish there were guest interviews of more experienced academicians than what happened here as interviews from which there was little to learn. Honestly, this is my 4th of 5th course on positive psychology and this one will have to make many a fixes to any other that I've taken on coursera. The course ended and I find myself not a tad upbeater or nourished, or knowing something useful that I did not know already other than about vegas nerves which really did not make sense to end user who are here to know what and how to do things and feel better.",2
"Uncomfortable to watch and also a very outdated layout of the course, feels like a bad 90s American talk show.",2
It could have been more dynamic . The interviews were boring and there wasn't enough content.,2
I'm sorry but I don't like the way this course was presented. Since this is about the science of happiness I would have preferred a more clinical approach.,2
Absolutely too perfunctory. Just a very slight notion of the subject.,2
"University of Michigan is the way to go, This course is very out of date",2
"Introduced too many tools in a single course. Javascript, CSS, JQuery is very vast and it is not possible to learn everything in one course. They should have been introduced one by one. It took a lot of time for me to capture what the video taught. I had to do a LOT of self learning",2
"I haven't completed the course yet but after html and css and some javascript, I didn't feel like continuing. the instructor doesn't suit me... kind of monotonous tbh. the content of the course seemed good but instructors play a huge role on delivering those content to the students so it just didn't work for me. especially the short haired instructor with constant hand movement and unblinking stare which is quite unnerving...",2
"HTML and CSS classes were great, but JavaScript classes were very confusing and difficult to understand.",2
It consists mostly of video lectures there is a lack of coding exercises,2
It can improve a lot.,2
"Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand-alone course. For example, there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven't been covered in the course, but you can't even look them up because they haven't given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google. This means that you'll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else.I have now started using Lynda instead, and am seeing all the bad habits I've picked up and the holes left in my knowledge. Normally I prefer Lynda to Coursera for the assignments and the quizzes, but not in this case...",2
"I am really disappointed, to be honest! Course covers mostly trivial stuff; lectures are just presenting code snippets; many inaccuracies; nothing about HTML5; entire 4-week-class can easily be completed in one week.Definitely not near the quality I am used to from Coursera. Udacity’s ""Intro to HTML and CSS"" and ""JavaScript Basics"" are way better.",2
"I think it the course goes extremely fast, I do not agree with its tittle of basic nor the instructors provide sufficient information to achieve the final quiz goal, I am not sure about completing the entire course. Thanks anyway.",2
Leaves out so much of basic stuff. I think this course is for 4th graders.,2
"The instructors are very knowledgeable, but the course seems to have the , ""we just threw this together at the last minute feel"". Many of the Quizzes are very poorly worded. The final project is a bit of a disaster as some of the reviewers are unable to unzip a generic '.gz' file and you can end up getting 0 points from those particular incompetent types.",2
really basic course. The second lecturer is disappointing.....,2
almost nothing.is it a course.so frustating after one week.not details.,2
many question in the quiz wasn't covered in the video lectures. I enrolled in this course looking for refreshing my info about the 3 subjects and hopefully gaining new in-depth info about them but the information presented during the course was very trivial and only covered few parts about the main 3 subjects,2
"This course needs an overhaul. There are mistakes in some code examples and quiz questions are sometimes ambiguous. While I appreciate the work that has gone into making this MOOC, there are better courses available on Coursera to learn this material.",2
There was a lot of questions on the tests that were never covered in the videos.,2
It can be better! However I learnt useful tips!,2
"Only very very basics. They won't teach you make well formed HTML documents, complete CSS files or learn to program in JavaScript.",2
"Very hard to follow unless you have had a good deal of experience with programming. I would not really recommend. Like the teachers OK, but they all went through too much material way too fast and without proper explanation. I will take other classes on programming and then come back to this one again later (maybe).",2
"I have followed 2 courses at the same time: this one and ""HTML, CSS and Javascript"". They are covering the similar topics but this class has fallen short on most of the subject.Lecture time is very little. Short videos, and few of them. Each video is mostly non-focused talking, very few examples and so you don't learn much.By comparison, the other class has a lot of videos, each video is much longer and goes into many examples. Time is spent on focusing on the things to learn, and you get a lot out of it.I am dropping out of this specialization and will follow the other one which I hope will bring good content (unfortunately the following classes are not from the same teacher but from the same university). The following classes from this specialization are from the same teacher, so I don't think things will improve much.",2
"A very lightweight intro to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and a dash of Boostrap. The instructors barely introduce the topics, and then point out that we don't need them, we can just ""Google or Yahoo"" for the information.If you just need a shove to get you moving down a path, this might be helpful, or if you are brand new to HTML, this would be a relatively painless way to check it out. I'm just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coding. The materials are pretty sparse and there is not much structure.All four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend.",2
Very easy. Not worth the money it requests.,2
"This course is extremely basic. Its planning is best summed up: “Just show them a memo, have the participants write one, and boom, success!” That one small, peer-evaluated exercise is not worth the fee.",2
The content from this course is already out of date for Meteor.js and links are broken.,2
A lot of stuff is just glossed over and not spent enough time on.,2
"The lectures are fine and the book is great, but the assignments have a lot of technical problems. I spent most of my effort trying to solve trivial issues with the sample code and dealing with the auto grader.",2
"I am kind of disappointed that you have to pay for the course before you can submit the solution to the problem set. However, that is not the main issue of this course, as I fully understand that the financial profit for the lecturer is very important. The main issue of this course is that the chaos in the symbol used in the second programming assignment, the lecturer cannot even main self-consistency in the symbol used. The statement of everything in both PA1 and PA2 is also very confusing.",2
"Course content is good, however, material is explained fairly quickly and the lady who is lecturing is almost impossible to understand (due to a very strong accent and a very mechanical reading), which made me want to skip all her lectures.",2
"Great Lectures, big content, high academic level But...Lectures are deeply dull: all but 5 or 6 (on nearly 70) are long static videos of a lecturer speaking like he/she is reading, sometimes even robot-like speeches, no cacthy at all.Sessions are based on Peer Evaluation, but often to find peers is a problem. I worked hard to do my assignment on time, then I had to switch sessions because no one was assessing my work.",2
It was really hard to complete the course as not enough peer reviewers were there. Had to switch sessions twice.,2
"Although I'm only the first week, there are two main comments I'd like to make.Firstly, why are the lectures sub-divided with the ridiculous, overlong, and irritating introduction for each section. In lesson one, this was repeated 11 times. What a waste of time!Secondly, the transcripts are in rich text, which is basically unreadable, has no line breaks, which makes reading the poems impossible, and the transcripts are poorly transcribed, making them illiterate.I feel I may not continue with the course for these reasons, even though the content is really interesting.This is the worst presented MOOC I have encountered.....I have completed 6, and am undertaking another 2, with edxcel and with futurelearn",2
"Professor Dinham's investigative and research based approach is great, and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwidely. The material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peer-assesed assignment is pretty well explained.However, I think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse, by adding complementary video lectures, research articles and book extracts in every week, since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week; course 5 of the specialization program is a great example of that.The first piece of peer-assessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express his/her own ideas, instead of request a summary from this. Multiple Choice Questions should follow the principles exposed in the 6th course of the specialization program, which seems to not be done at all. Forums prompts should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened.",2
"Having only video lessons is really heavy and time consuming. I'd like to have all the material in written format too so that i can come back to skim trough how some modal or tense works. Now if i wanted to recap something, i had to guess the video, and then watch it just to notice it wasn't the right one. Super difficult. Having all the material in well formatted written format, i could been able to easily skip the parts i already know. Now it wan't possible and i had to spend way too much time for simple things.Also more practices would have been nice. Now there was like three quiz questions per topic. that's not enough for proper learning. Most of the ""gamified"" practices outside coursera were good though. I encourage you to have more links outside coursera and point out material where i could deepen my knowledge about the topic.Also some times this course didn't explain differences between different ways of saying the same thing. It confused me a lot as i wasn't sure why one would say it in one way and other in some other way. If different ways of saying same things do not have any difference in meaning, nor emphasis on different things, it definitely should be mentioned too as it is also very valuable information.This course has lots of potential and the structure was good, but due to lack of good written material i can't recommend this to any of my friends :/",2
"The presented material wasn't coherent for me, I didn't walk away with knowledge of functional design principles for larger/complex software. The topics presented seems just a bunch of topics next to each other.",2
"A sharp decline in quality and cohesion from the Functional Programming Principles in Scala course. It may be worth enrolling just to hear Odersky's elegant lecturing at work once again, but if you're interested in the core concepts, I would highly recommend picking up a highly rated book instead.",2
The mix of materials from different courses hurts the structure of this course.,2
"I expected more. Week 2 on streams in my opinion was a very strong week and well worth time and effort. Week 1, 2 and 3 were pretty weak in my opinion. I don't feel like I've learned much or that the exercises reflected what was being taught in the lectures. For example on week 4 the exercises do nothing with futures even though there's 6 lectures on them. Week 3 spends 3 long lectures how to build a discrete simulation application and exercises are about property checking. Course felt disjointed and not really finished. Would NOT recommend and definitely would not pay 79 USD for.",2
The course was still useful and with new information but I really found it lacking cohesion with the overall specialization and with its own content.,2
Several courses have been combined. Content is not updated. Now is 2016.,2
"It's mixed from previous courses on Scala. Not coherent, many unrelated topics with little explanation of their importance and real-world use cases.",2
"This course is a re-hash of both the excellent ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"" and the mediocre ""Principles of Reactive Programming in Scala"". Unfortunately, in quality it's closer to the latter: mixed quality, lectures that seem unrelated to their corresponding assignments, many errors (both typos and, more seriously, examples that don't type-check!) and a general lack of an in-depth motivation for the principles. Staff participation in my run of the course (2016) was disappointingly low; in some cases there was no response at all to students pointing out glaring errors in the lectures.It's very noticeable that this course is a patchwork of previous courses. In same cases the video lectures even display the wrong title for the course, or mention lectures that no longer exist in this version of the course!The course has interesting parts (I was especially thrilled when I saw there were lectures about FRP), but its quality is way below ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"". I'm disappointed.To make this review constructive, my recommendations:1- Pay attention to quality. Make sure all examples compile and type-check.2- Make sure you're not repeating content already in other courses, especially if they are part of the same specialization!3- If you're going to re-use content from other contents, make sure it fits the current course. Do not mention lectures not in the course.",2
Not very interesting,2
"Very interesting subject. I was really wainting for a course like that but, with all due respect and aknowledgement to the instructors, their is many ways this course could have been an inspiring and exciting journey. Vincent",2
"The course tackles an interesting topic: why do we enjoy music?But there are two problems with this course:1) It fails to provide convincing evidence for its claims; the evidence is circumstantial and flimsy.2) The lecturer is, how shall I say this politely, monotonic. He lacks enthusiasm.My recommendation: if you are interested in the topic, take this course and make your own mind up. Maybe it will convince you. If not, you will have learnt a bit about human perception a sound perception.",2
"Very dry and uninspired.The lecturer monotonically reads off some material.The explanations don't usually make any sense.The quizzes are a guessing game, arbitrarily connected (or not) to the lecture material.In retrospect: a waste of my time.",2
"This class isn't very good. It is confusing and not well explained, and the quizzes are too short and badly written. I gave up on week 5 (of 6) because I just didn't feel i was learning very much, particularly about what the title of the course would suggest you'd be learning about.",2
"It is odd that a course that concentrates so vehemently on speech tone, as a segue to music would be taught by a monotone and mostly unenthused professor. Often verbose, but never succinct, I had to listen to his drone twice to glean anything of value.His tests were wrought with ""gotcha"" questions, having nothing to do with the important material of the course. As a physicist, I was very disappointed in his treatment of the important equations associated with the mathematics of music (mentioned as ""too hard"" to understand).There was nearly no mention of rhythm and its importance in music, as relates to biology and/or emotion, and no mention of how those rhythms relate to heartbeat.I am deeply disappointed, but I do hope this critique is seen as an opportunity to create a better course.",2
"The content was interesting, but the quizzes didn't relate to the lectures very often. It was as if there was a major piece missing in this course. One of the questions even referenced a book that was never mentioned or made available. Also, several of the musical sections seemed to be in the wrong place. I think maybe this is one of the classes that doesn't work well in this format.",2
It seems that all these types the course is based on are not quite scientifically proven. Also the materials are very pro-american culture like this link http://mentalfloss.com/article/65218/10-myers-briggs-type-charts-pop-culture-characters Not very helpful and inclusive.,2
Content of the course and presentation was great. But the audio quality was not so good. As they are echos on the background and need to set to high volume to heard the speaker.,2
This is a very basic course and should state that in the description.,2
"A lot of formulas and theory which if attempted by the casual investor would quickly overwhelm him and reduce him to a babbling idiot with no investments.One useful tip: Use a 20% drop in ""Consumer Confidence"" to warn you of an impending recession and sell everything; back into equity when the Consumer Confidence level gets back to its trigger point.",2
"Too repetitive. Very boring. Unnecessarily verbose. The instructor's tone of speech gets annoying after a while. I skipped a lot, and didn't finish it.",2
"Too long, too academic, not practical.",2
The support by the mentors could be much better. Because of the missing support I was not able to solve the assignments under Windows with Octave. I had to buy Matlab. (-2)It seems to me that the course is very difficult to complete without additional sources. (-1),2
"The content seems to be excellent regarding ""what"" is presented. But sadly the sound quality is rather bad: Sounds like an age-old valve radio with A LOT of dropouts. And Professor Daphne is an agile and therefore less disciplined speaker which lessens the understandability of her speech in conjunction with the poor sound quality furthermore. Especially for me as a non-native foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow. And now I am at one point in the course, that is ""Flow of Probalistic Influence"", where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions ""flow"" and ""influence"" which makes me difficult to understand what is going on. That means in my point of view that the slides are not sufficiently prepared. Although I'm very interested in the topic I am asking myself after the first view videos if I should continue or drop because my cognitive capacitity is for me to worthful to use it for the decoding of badly prepared and presented material. Ok, my decision heuristic in such cases is ""Use the hammer not the tweezers!"". Therefore I have dropped. Please improve the state of this class from beta to release. Then I will come back.",2
"For a while, that's the worst course of scala specialization. All the parallelism is just obvious division of a one big piece on several small pieses, and perfrom parrallel tasks on it. It's enogh to write merge sort with several threads to get the main idea, which is proposed here. You don't need to watch 4 weeks of coursera video and perform tasks to get it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I expected something more than trivial division. Besides that, I don't like the tasks. And I hate the last one week. Very bad description of the problem, it made me really suffer. I'd like much more the first 2 courses. Which I rated as 5 and 4 accordingly, but this one is fail. Besides that, I like the theory about parallel and concurent programming, and all the stuff about ""iron"". Hope the 4th one course will be better.",2
It's difficult to follow the content. The way it is organized could be greatly improved.,2
"The approach in this course is incorrect, I think that will be a course with more concret examples, but is a course with a lot of teory that is not applied.",2
"The course presents two core approaches to parallel programming - task and data parallelism. While these concepts are really useful, I expected more details on, for example, how to implement the _parallel_ construct used throughout the lectures. The materials were good and I can use some of the ideas straight after the lectures in my everyday coding, but the assignments were really slightly related to the topic.Barnes Hut simulation assignment. I'd say it has nothing in common with parallel programming in Scala. It looks like the authors looked for some real-life example or use case for Combiners and this simulation model looked nice. But, really, does any developer not working in university would ever use it? It's completely impractical, the most of the time I spent reading the description of simulation model, but the coding itself was just playing with 2D coordinates and some basic recursion. I'd expect something more practical, e.g. implementing simplified form of Hadoop map-reduce or something like that so I can use it after the course. But Barnes-Hut is too specific and is pretty far from everyday problems developers encounter.",2
"Excellent lectures, let down by the difficulty of the assignments.While the tutors clearly know their stuff, I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new (to me) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped.I'm an experienced professional programmer with the EPFL 'FP in Scala' and FRP courses under my belt, so I thought I knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than I'd thought.",2
"It was way too theoretical, the concepts were not clearly explained, the tests had concepts that had not been explained and the teacher is not good explaining it, it is too monotonous",2
The pre-written code in the assignments is not so good.,2
"Unlike the very first course for beginners, there is a little bit more content here, so I put 2 stars. However, I still found the pace was too slow, with too much distraction (""funny"" videos, teacher drinking and making mistakes, hummm !!!). It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses, not 5 (with the capstone). I am planning to move forward with Python, and to keep reading the booklet which is good (I like the introduction about the HTTP, XML, JSON and SQL databases) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation, it is overpriced for what it is !!",2
The course is an introduction to the absolute basics of python. Programming assignments are not very challenging and the course could benefit by adding more content and challenging tasks for those who wish to challenge themselves.,2
"The course is really trivial. Maybe I was expecting so much, but the material is really to simple. Also there are a lot of material which lector things is fun and cool, but it is really anoying. Please, try to focus more on programming instead of being cool and fun. Thanks for understanding.",2
an easy one,2
Course moved a little too slowly,2
Just wasn't a fan of the videos: way too long and oftentimes unrelated to the course material. Quizzes had no connection to the lectures either.,2
"Good content but man I am struggling with the verbose, pedantic style. It's like you are teaching college stuff to 8th graders. If you say someone values something at $20, you don't have to say - that means he will let it go if offered $21 and will not let it go if offered only $19. That's a waste of my time and yours.",2
"Not very applicable for the real world. Recursion over lists can be a nice mind exercise but please don't use it in real world, there are way too many stack overflows, unneeded context switches and cryptic code already, don't add to it.",2
Questions seem geared towards school children. Having ridiculously obvious answers in multiple choice is an insult and I now think I've wasted my time doing this course as your accreditation will mean nothing to business in the future if you are just giving accreditation away so easily.,2
"I think that a lot more that could be explained and taught in this course. I would have preferred if some qualitative and qualitative risk identification and assessment were taught, and also solve good examples of risk response methods.",2
"Course content is quite interesting, but it is a real pity that the english is so bad. Sometimes the lessons were very hard to follow and the quizzes often made little sense.",2
Interesting content but the bad English grammar makes it hard to get through and sometimes simply incomprehensible. I dropped the course after the second week because of this.,2
"Very interesting course material, however, texts are often in such bad English that they are incomprehensible, and the staff does not react in the Discussion section.",2
The material was very interesting but the lecturers were often very difficult to understand.,2
"I appreciate the effort of the professor and the University but I found this course extremely theoretical , research is a practical thing that a PR practitioner should know how to do, in practice. I understand that all courses should have an introduction and presentation of basic concepts but I don't see myself getting very far with this knowledge of research.",2
"I am sorry, but this course is made by PR specialist, people that should know how to talk to the public.Some teachers of this specialisation should been trained on how to behave in front of a camera.The content is nice but you repeat too many time the same stuff, in a very neutral voice, so it is really hard to keep watching the course.Thanks for sharing your knowledge, it is really helpful and rich, but as communication specialist, you can't just read a text, you have to live it.The source is important when releasing a message ! that's what you said ! The source should a good CV, but also has to know how to present the message.",2
"Too long, too academic, not practical.",2
"For a course with the name ""Pro Tool Basics"", I was expecting some specific knowledge about this particular software but what the course really teaches is basic music production things (samples, synthesizers, how to create tracks, how to record audio, compressors, EQs, etc).As I am already a music producer using Logic Pro, I was hoping to learn more about the software itself and its differences in comparison with other DAWs in the market, so I was a little bit disappointed in the end!",2
"Although it is a very informative class and Chrissy is a good teacher, I am finding this class to be EXTREMELY troublesome unless one possesses the means to purchase a great deal of equipment and product to work within Pro Tools. It should be noted that Pro Tools First (the ""FREE"" version I downloaded) is a DETRIMENT to learning in this course and will effect your grade negatively. I am also dismayed by the lack of community participation in the forums. On other Berklee / Coursera classes, this hasn't been nearly as much of a problem.",2
very basic,2
This course was so dry.... I could barely keep myself engaged. I know project management is not that boring. :(,2
very basic,2
Pretty boring and quite hard to follow. Not all subjects in the quizzes were covered in the study material provided or in the lessons,2
Covers only the very basics for project management.,2
It was helpful but too technical for non-business person to learn about basic project management. It also would have been easier to understand if the information presented were to be broken down into smaller sizes.,2
"Not really engaging, most of the material looks really outdated, and the instructor has a very ""classical"" way of presenting, which does not profit from the potentialities offered by Coursera.",2
"This course seemed to me the most un-interesting course. The content though important was not taught in a way to engage the student. The professor basically read everything. I could have easily done with slides than a lecture. Hopefully, this course can be revised to make it more exciting, interesting and engaging.",2
interesting course to support previously knoledgement or improve it.,2
Really too basic for meaningful learning. The instructor was not very engaging and by the end of the course just seemed hungry and ready to be done.,2
Very poor teaching,2
"Excessively short course. Like previous course in the specialization no slides of the lectures were provided. Approach over-simplistic. IE could done more. Also as in previous course there was no supervision from the staff of the discussion forums. Also looking at the big picture, there is a tremendous gap in quality and approach to online courses between EU institutions and US top tier institutions (favoring the US offerings). Looking at Wharton, U. Michigan, Yale courses (just to mention a few) and then looking at the majority of European offerings, the gap is very salient. If IE wants to stay relevant in this online space, some benchmark is advised... If you are in the 'game', you must 'play' it better...I hope you will accept my critic as constructive and positive, not as negative. As an European I am more critic and I would like to see more quality, relevance and credibility of EU offerings. As it is, it is a matter of time until Wharton and U. Michigan spread their offerings into this specific field and with a superior approach they will most likely divert students to their offerings, probably lowering and marginalizing your courses.But despite my critics it is fair to salute you for your efforts and availability to offer this course.I wish yoy luck.Ricardo J. Oliveira",2
"Ok course.When I am taking a course from Wharton school, and from adult learning perspective, more is expected than simply small lectures and few activities. Some areas that I see this may be improved...1) Latest evidence based support (few articles/papers) on achievement and satisfaction (Success both parameters). This is widely discussed field as subjective and objective career success.2) In addition to SAME - better instruments/scale those are easily available online.3) Some better links to career related articles from Harvard/California management review or organization dynamics on the topics covered.",2
"Great review of concepts to refresh lean and six sigma, and process improvement in GENERAL.Expected deeper and more practical information (case studies, maybe a project in a module instead of a quiz, etc.) regarding the service industry as stated at the beginning of the course. There just one part of a module (aprox. 15 min) that got into some detail.Also, there was no interaction at all in the forums. If at least the mentors could set some interesting subjects and comments to motivate that, would be of help.Due to this, my expectations weren´t met. Was looking for detailed service industry (financial) applications of process improvement knowledge.",2
"I would not recommend this course. The content is very relevant to the subject matter. However, the lectures are much longer than they need to be, and filled with unnecessary commentary. The instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself. The delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk-through of the equation at hand.",2
"This course strayed too far from its origins. Yes, this course contains topics that are nice-to-know, but they are by no means essential or useful.",2
"The continuity and smoothness of the first two Python courses have been lost. From week 3 onward the assignments were badly worded, and that distracts the learning. People were trying to decipher the wording of the questions, not learning how to code. Lectures of later weeks were ""rushed"", very little buildup of understanding and I felt assignments were done for the sake of passing, very little were learned during those final 3 to 4 weeks. Effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained. May be there are topics that needed to be introduced for Course 4, will see, as I'll be doing straight after. The course overall is still very positive and the prof. clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated.",2
For the third Course in the Python specialisation this is a very basic 6 weeks. The assignments are repetitive and you are pretty much spoon fed everything. If you are looking for a challenging course this is not for you!,2
This class is not challenging at all,2
"Professor is good and funny, and subject is interesting, but that's all. Very basic course, very easy to follow and not at all challenging. Also (maybe because being that easy), peer review is compromised by people who doesn't really know what they're doing there, with comments that were clearly made without any knowledge about the subject.",2
"Compared to other Python Courses I have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is NOT worth $80 at all even for a certificate. However for FREE? ok. Worth the introduction to some useful tools. Spend your time and money on a more valuable course like Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, which is awesome, and is about the same price as of this writing.This course offers no challenge, little content, and the assignments let me down. Assignments are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hour.Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python thru Rice U has content and weekly mini projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses, I felt like I really got something out of it.This course barely scratches the surface of ""Accessing Web Data"" and does nothing to challenge your coding skills. The positive side, it introduces you to Web API's, the basics of Beautiful Soup, and other BUZZWORDS. At least structure assignments to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one another.Side note... what is the professor doing filming lectures on vacation or at lunch? This does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofesh.The meaningless assignments let me down.",2
"Too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.",2
"This class' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course. The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop. I'm hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background.",2
There is a large difference between the skills acquired in the video's and the skills needed to fulfill the assignments. There are errors in the video's and without the help of the UCI help forum it is hard to get the assignments right. You can acquire a broad set of skills interfacing with the Raspberry PI but Google is your best friend.,2
One of the worst courses I have taken on Coursera. I have been in IT for 20 years and expected a lot more in this course. There were a couple times that the instructor was inaccurate about a some of the concepts he was teaching.,2
I expect the projects and Peer Graded to be a litle difficult.,2
Much of the code is outdated (I'm using python 3.5). Fix this and you'll have 4 or 5 stars easy.,2
"its more a linux introducction, not the expected from the title. the content is good but no what was expeceted, as it said interfacing I thought it was more about sensors and gpio programming",2
The course is so simple and just has only a few interesting points.,2
this course just for a newbie,2
only a small portion was applicable to my country and school environment,2
"Scope for improvement. Nevertheless, thank you.",2
"A very high level approach. These courses require a better math background and far more concrete explanation, since the student has a passive role and lecture mode is on.",2
"Too many theory and reading from lecture slides. It would be way much better if some examples were included. Quizzes could include some more questions, too.",2
The teacher can explain more and not just read through the slides.,2
"Good lecture and content. However, disappointing that even when I audit the course, I cannot take the exams. This is contrary to most of the other Coursera courses where you can. If you cannot afford to participate you have limited access to the testing material. I'm not impressed.",2
Very basic collection of concepts. Not too much practical exercices,2
"Sorry to say that, but this course has nothing related to programming. I like Dr.Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots. If you have any programming experience you don't need this course it doesn't pay off your time you spend for this. Sorry again, but it's my opinion.",2
It could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts.,2
No new learning during this course. Working on the capstone project is practically optional.,2
Sorry folks but we are not learning much here,2
Not the quality i expected. The capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new.,2
"There was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses. Also, this course started too late after the other courses and I lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework.",2
The assignments were not challenging enough.,2
"The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either. Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.",2
"As a captstonse course I expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation, especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing pre-written scripts and uploading screenshots. Rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb, combined with the awesome teaching skills of Dr. Chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately.",2
Very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from Capstone.,2
I expected more practical exercises. but I did learn some,2
"The course offers just a simple running of (interesting and useful) code, but doesn't put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code.",2
"Probably I am biased by just having followed edX's Minds and Machines. Compared to that course, the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging. This becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses. Also the quizzes are way too easy and you can try until you get it right. This makes the certificate virtually worthless, although you can pay for it.",2
Sorry but he puts me to sleep. No emotion.,2
Almost totally ignores the ancients. A skewed view of philosophy from an enlightenment perspective.,2
It seems I have failed at week three without having to ask for the answers for three questions.,2
"Sorry, but of no real use except to people totally",2
"The name of this course is misleading to me (and if it's misunderstood by one, you can assume there are other people affected as well) - it would be more clear what's expecting you if the course would be called something similar to the last assignment name ""Creating a data-driven website"".The responsive part that I was interested in, was basically done with ""use bootstrap"" - that's pretty poor. Of course the course isn't responsible for this, but an appropriate name would fix that.Throughout the course, the quizzes were entertaining - but the quality of the questions is questionable. Sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous, sometimes you don't know what to click, even though you just watched the video carefully. Reason for this is that there are questions being asked, which weren't even touched in the lesson.It's basically the same with the last assignment - you can watch and do all the lessons before, you've got no idea how to start and what to do as there's simply no explanation of what affects what - which seems to be extremely important in javascript. Yes, it's often told in an overview-style explanation what a function is doing, but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lacking.The quality of the explanations also varied in their quality. Some things that were pretty easy to understand, were explained over 10 very boring minutes, other things that were far more complex and tricky, were handled in half a minute. This made watching the videos frustrating at times. I'm not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for, but the style varies way too much.Furthermore it's great that coursera is offering an iPad-app, but I'd like to be able to use and do everything that the app is offering me (and in the best case: everything that's necessary for the course). I can't even review classmates, as they're uploading .rar or .zip-files, which can't be accessed via iPad, and also javascript is a problem for ipads. Unpacking such files and running them on your servers would be an option, maybe.",2
Very theoretical course they should add some hands on. Its like mugging things for quiz.,2
Videos mostly show lecturers talking to camera.,2
"Wasn't much of a class about responsive design, only one of the four weeks talked about responsive web design. Much of the class was about parts of building sites that aren't relevant to building a responsive site. The week that discussed responsive design just talked about using bootstrap",2
Mostly disappointing. I found only one week interesting and non-biased.,2
"Some interesting ideas. Unfortunately some of the presentation was so poor that it was impossible to work out what points, if any, were being presented. And for a course called ""Science and Philosophy"" there was far too much religious and/or anti-science content.",2
"Some of the knowledge is useful in life. But they are not integrated well. They let you feel that they are just knowledge but you can hardly connect them with food, with daily life or with your health. The good knowledge teaching should be like how much calorie we need per day? how much food equal to 1000 calories? What is the good sample for eating or cooking? Knowledge is not only formula. This course is not that interesting. But, thanks for the teacher all the same.",2
"Much of the syntax is outdated in updated external libraries. Would have been helpful to include Python 3 syntax for all programs. Slides were not translated to English, so external sources were required to understand many of the slides.",2
Couldn´t finish it because assigmnets were not graded.,2
Over reliance on student grading. Material does not map well to the quizzes.,2
abstract and uninformative stories about some photographersbut not about the profession of the photographer or the technical side of the workThank you for the opportunity to get acquainted with the course,2
"Vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia, ideas, and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often aren't even closely aligned with the original artist's intentions.A brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting, otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless. This course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography.",2
"I think it would be better if the professor had covered Markowitz theorem, and showed how CAPM is derived from the theorem. I think the first two courses in the series are too basic and should be combined. They are only useful from people who have no background in finance.",2
Too easy.,2
"too basic, wish they had more content",2
Very boring,2
It was an interesting first experience with Python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually. I have been able to complete the hole course on one free day.,2
"Sorry to say that, but this course has nothing related to programming. I like Dr.Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots.

"The course offers just a simple running of (interesting and useful) code, but doesn't put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code.",2
"This is just a poor sample of a course. Very few material, low quality assignments and grading.",2
"The contents and quality of the video lectures are great.The quality of the supplementary materials (like the quizzes and the Matlab code) provided by TAs for the assignments are very poor. The assignment guides are written with very poor grammar. The Matlab code is written using the worst coding and documenting practices. The automatic evaluation system (the system for grade the submissions), doest't provide useful feedback. As people can read in the course discussion forums, students have been asking for months for improvements to the grading systems.",2
"Interesting material, and good assignments. However this is no assistance when by TAs if you have questions, which is important since there is no feedback on assignments and hard to know where you went wrong.",2
"The assignments in this course take much more time than indicated. Feedback from staff is minimal. If you are not a good programmer, think twice. Nevertheless, the lectures are interesting and well taught. So if you do not want a certicficate, I recommend this.",2
"Prof. Taylor's lectures were clear and easy to understand. The course taught the basics of planning pretty well.The teaching staff, unfortunately, was completely unavailable. The solution checkers for the Matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students' time. There were several queries about the assignments on the Discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff. The students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers, and by helping each other. This certainly soured my experience with the course.",2
No much staff in it,2
"The course could be 1-week long instead of 4. The material offered is introductory level. Quizes are too easy, programming assignments still have bugs, and grading procedures cause a lot of confusion.",2
Many problems and mistakes found in the assignment programs and I felt a lack of staff assistance on helping solving them.,2
"So I'll start with the positives. The material was appropriate and interesting and well presented. CJ Taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course, I definitely want to learn more about computational motion planning.The problems I have with this course though are numerous. This is the second part of the Robotics Specialization and compared to the first part, this course was very weak. There was very little lecture material and the course felt thin - as if it were 2 weeks of material stretched over 4. There were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didn't, I appreciate that you can't cover everything in lectures, but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resources?The assessments were the worst part. The quizzes barely tested what I had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense. What I find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily brute-force these quizzes if you really wanted to. Compare this to the Aerial Robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecture.The programming assignments were shockingly bad. They were hard for completely the wrong reasons. I spent most of my time on them not coding the solution, but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO EDIT. The autograder would never tell you why you were wrong, just ""I'm sorry, your solution didn't pass all of our test cases."" This meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought. This was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow - and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressful.One of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it out.The final assignment wouldn't even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code. This would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehand.Thing is, the tasks provided in principle weren't that hard, they were actually kind of too easy. Dijkstra's algorithm isn't that difficult to implement from scratch, and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small 10 line for-loop. That said, I appreciate that as a software engineer, I might find this sort of thing much easier than most, but even so I don't feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anything.Overall, regardless of how interesting the material was, this course was very shoddily put together. I appreciate this is the first time the course has been run, but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable. I paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free MOOCs I have taken. I feel ripped off and I sincerely hope that the next section is better otherwise I doubt I will bother to continue until the end. I thought Penn University was better than this.",2
"This was an interesting course, however there were bugs and errors in most of the assignment materials, which really impaired the learning experience since much of it was reduced to debugging the course organiser's code... Also the 3rd and fourth sections, including assignments, seemed to be rather small and to cover very little material, with little or no supporting material. Moreover, course staff were conspicuous by their absence on the course forums. A stark contrast to the abundance of support provided and material covered in aerial robotics.",2
"Extremely basic.The assignments would be easy except that the provided code has bugs, and some of the assignment details are wrong, making it very difficult to pass the test cases.There is also very little information on how the work will be graded.",2
The Assignments are more of Trial and Error and not very helpful. The Course Material and Content is good. Teaching Staff is nowhere to be found.,2
"The assignments were hard, not because of the contents of the courser, but for understanding the context of the method being implemented (what each variable meant and how it was expressed).Also, there should be a range of submissions that could be right but having higher or lower scores depending of how long it took to find the path, or how long the path was to reach the goal.",2
"Readings were not necessary for the course and quizzes were extremely difficult, seeming to be worded in an attempt to stump students, and many questions were not from the course lessons. Videos very dry and boring.",2
"The material is useful, but the execution is poor. There were numerous quiz questions that I think they just had coded wrong on their end. I think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if they've made a mistake. Also, this might be the first time they've tried making a peer-reviewed project part of the course, but they did a poor job. They made it a homework assignment for week 2, but didn't make it clear that it wasn't due until the end of the course, even though Coursera sends you emails saying it's due soon. This caused a great deal of confusion. Some of the required readings also had broken links. It's odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught. They do provide a lot of useful supplemental material (though often pay-walled).",2
"I learned a few things. The videos were good. The feedback from the student reviews was erratic. There was some good, thoughtful feedback and some was nonsense. I took the free option. I don't think I'd ever pay for a course where evaluations are conducted by people who understand the material no better than I do.This is the second course in this series that I completed. I also finished the machine learning course. I think I'm done with this specialization.",2
"As with all Coursera courses, there is no way to communicate with the tutors, which is vey important in such a specialised course. The course also requires finishing assignments while needed clarification and explanation is not always provided in the course videos. in some assignment a required step was only explained in the following week (Centering variables).Assignments review depend only on peer review, when peers in most of the time don't read through assignment completely or open attachments leading to poor grading based on 'missed information' that are actually attached in submissions.Also this course along with the rest of the courses in the Data Analysis and Interpretation need some more focus on using SAS and other data analysis tools and the way to present results in a more appealing way. (this could be given one extra lecture in each course).",2
Could be more clear about how to calculate period and latency.,2
The content is very good but the lecture presentation and structure could use improvement. Assignment instructions are not as clear as they could be.,2
"The videos should be completely reconsidered. Instructors pointing at virtual points on screen does not help at all. The course creators tried to squeeze in many concepts in 4 weeks. More examples should be provided in lectures, not just abstract math (e.g. lectures on projective transformation).",2
"Lots of cutting edge mathematical and computer vision concepts, but a serious lack of support. No technical staff around to help, only one or two examples of how the math works, and a general poor explanation of the concepts.This course is not for beginners, and I recommend you steer clear if you do not posses at minimum a bachelors in mathematics.",2
"This course should have been very good. Lots of detail. But the material is not presented very clearly. The Assignments are also not setup so that it is easy to fix your work. It either passes, or you get minimal feedback.",2
"Professors very hard to understand, and videos don't have the best editing.Also extremely math heavy, lectures being just math formulas, without a lot of real life applicability (ex. the assignments where you have to project a logo, or cube, when the program gives you the location corners in a file, which will NEVER happen when you use your camera; finding that position is a pre-requisite of the entire program)",2
"Hubiera sido genial que se puedan dar los exámenes, y ya el pago por el certificado aparte. - It will be really great that you can make the quizz and get your results without paying, because you will not get the verified certify.",2
"The speaker isn't very good, he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the slides. I am not very happy about this course, I think it could be better if subjects would be deeper.",2
Too high level,2
Way too shallow and way too english :(,2
"Reproducible research with doubt is important but videos and what it is discuss are not appealing and beyond that, what are worthen are the projects. I did not learn so much from the videos but by myself. Though, the forum is very useful.",2
Sholdnt be a different course. It shold be very very concise. Not this long.,2
Provides a very summary overview of a very important aspect of data analysis. Expected more!,2
"This course seems 'light' in content - too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research. Perhaps this should be a topic/chapter in another course, and not a standalone course.",2
"It is not a bad course, but it is very little informative. There is some nice general discussions about data science by the teacher, there is the explanation of the package knitr, and little else.As part of the data science specialization it is nice. As a stand-alone course, I would definitely not recommend it.",2
"Seems like the course lectures are out of order or duplicated. In order for us the complete the first project, it required us to view Week 2 videos as well. I wish this was noted/told to the students in the course.",2
Instructor not as good. A big fail when you need the 2nd lesson in order to complete the 1st programming assignment.,2
The course is poorly organised: There is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two. Some concepts are dictated more than once because it uses videos made for this course + other recorded from a class room.I think this course should be a 3 weeks project and the price should be the half of it cost.Though I enjoyed the second project.,2
It requires you to use a lot of personal information - I did not do well on a peer graded assignment because I didn't give out enough information about what my teaching level is. I fail to see how it is relevant to learning the course and do not feel comfortable volunteering the amount of information many other people do.,2
"What's there is ok, but there is only a few minutes of lecture material each week.",2
"When I took, assignments 2 and 4 were broken and there were no mentors to help students. However, I am now told they will be fixing the course. I give 2 stars becuase the concepts of the assignments is good, but the course needs more attention.",2
"Very important materials are explained super briefly. I would only suggest it for getting familiar with the estimation ""keywords and terminologies"" or for someone who wants to brush up his/her prior knowledge in estimation. The total session time for all 4 weeks together is only a few hours and the homeworks do not cover the session topics.",2
It is not very clear. The assignments have several problems with the given code. There are many things to improve in the next sessions.,2
very borring and too simple,2
Assignments should be much more clear in terms of what is expected from the students and how to approach the problem.,2
"Very poor and a complete lack of interaction from Mentors/Tutors. Learners are left behind shooting bullets at the sky hoping to hit a star that might fall over with some hints. The course materials is consistent and very well informed but, as mentioned mentors/tutors since course began never showed up to clarify some frequent issues with Matlab codes and input data.Felt disappointed!!!",2
"I'm sorry, but I felt the week 4 assignment materials is not consistent to lesson videos or the lesson video does not explained enough.I think that making students think does not mean making explanation indistinct.",2
"Much better Courses are available for free on udacity and edx. this is only a money making course. concepts used are very old. nothing new in this course. One can dwell in PID controllers for life, its a huge are and the way its used here is totally ancient. its just some ancient methods in new quadcopters.",2
"Interesting course. But definitely not for beginners. With a designer background, I could never accomplish this course. I really hope Penn could offer course in such topic for beginners!",2
Just PID in MATLAB and not very well explained.,2
Assignments for week 3 and 4 were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coding part. But since I'm interested in the course i'm re-enrolling to complete it this time.,2
"This course successfully covers the mechanics and control topics of quadrotors. The course also points to some resources in order to extend your study on UAVs. However, there are some issues concerning the assignments which I didn't like at all:1. Big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week.2. The difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping (somewhat 'smartly') a 1,2,3, or 6 dimensional parametric space. I guess that real UAVs engineers are not paid for this. In some assignment, I had to edited a file which I was not supposed to edit in order to pass it.3. The last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasons3a. Really long running times to test if the parameters work fine. I would sacrifice the fancy real-time visualization to save some time. Apart from long running times, I guess that UAVs are not solving ODEs in real time on board, so I think is more interesting a more practical/real-time approach.3b. Search in a 12-dimensional parametric space (some parameters are equal, but still you end up tunning 5,6 independent parameters, which influence each other). Come on, is this useful? I am sure that UAVs engineers don't spend their hours in this kind of crappy search. You could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tune.3c. Even though the drone trajectory seems to fit perfectly the planned trajectory, you might not pass the exercise, and you would get some clueless messages telling you the final position/velocity is not correct.3d. The assignment guide is very unclear in some parts.3e. A lot of typos in the formulas of the last part of the guide. I decided to completely ignore it and develop my own strategy, which turned out to be far simpler and easier to implement.3f. The submission program tests the whole exercise regardless you passed some sections or not, which make the waiting times even longer.",2
This course definitely requires prerequisite knowledge of calculus and matrix math. There is also very little in the way of practical application. The MatLab work is interesting but barely explained. The assignments were nearly impossible without help from other students. Understanding which equations that were shown in the lecture (not necessarily explained) were useful in completing the assignments was not apparent and there was no help from the TAs.I don't think the assignments were irrelevant but without having a background in academic engineering the course needs to walk through similar exercises with explanations to increase understanding and ability to complete the course.While I don't think this course was well presented and I can't say I truly learned anything I am glad I was exposed to the material and I will continue with the Specialization.,2
"A tough score, which I have mixed feelings about as there was good stuff in here too. The course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and I do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one PhD student's dissertation. Realistically I would not recommend this course if you don't have a STEM Bachelor's degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years. None of this is bad, although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time, and have less time per week with family commitments. Unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work:1 - Inconsistencies and errors in the material. Certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse, changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are. I don't feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted ""interpreting""2 - Tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of ""correct well done"" or worse I'm sorry to say, the relatively useless feedback ""sorry that is not correct"", without ANY explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why. I can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research, but if they hit a wall, realistically they're going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week. I wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here3 - TA Support - The lack of TA support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week 3. For 10 days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct. NOT ONCE did a TA wake up and step in. In the end one of the students flagged the video as ""inappropriate"" to wake the UPenn organization up. The TA then stepped in and said (I paraphrase) ""oh, we just dropped those terms because they're not so important, but we didn't mention that..."" If you are not going to adequately support the students, the material had better be bullet-proof and show some linear thinking4 - The last exam. Keep in mind if you do this course, you had better be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, vector math/mechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in Matlab. That said, the last question in the last exam, was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a ""shake out"" question. I passed the course and had a good understanding of the material, but I suspect that the folks that did, made it through that last question in multiple random fashions. The material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so. Unfortunately the one example (jerk trajectory) provided appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback I saw, and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through. As for the final exam, it would be highly desirable for UPenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didn't come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have",2
"I think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well. The supplementary material is very good in that regard, compared to the lectures. However, there are too few to make up for it. I would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.As a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory.",2
"Not well prepared and not well explained. They throw formulas at you and read it aloud instead of explaining the nature behind those.They change notations every lecture, sometimes in the same lecture. It's easy but these things made it artificially dificult.At least it's better than the next one in the specialization",2
"My feeling is that the course creator(s) did not fully prepare and scope of the course materials (i.e., lectures, supporting artifacts, assignments) required for the available time alloted to each week's topic. No syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started, which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials. The lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants. At the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format; not very conducive for detailed review. The student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials, which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session. The assignments say they require 3 hours, but I would venture to say that most students have spent way more than 3 hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment. In summary, the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience.",2
Quizzes and Assignments are poorly designed. You will spend most of your time tuning parametersand deriving matrices that were never discussed in the course. Unfortunate.,2
This course is not a beginner level course rather it is an intermediate one. I had to put in more than 10 hours a week to complete this course. A basic knowledge of control theory is a must.,2
"This course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter. It gives a lot of formulae without proper explanations. A lot of quiz answers do not come from the video lectures. The course is really just spitting formulae from the dissertation ""Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors"" by Daniel Warren Mellinger (easily found using search engines). Reading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formulae they say out of context without the proper explanations. Sorry for the bad review, it's the first time I leave one like that, although I've completed many MOOCs. I hope it will help to improve the course.",2
The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics. But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared. The lectures are not well organized. Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials. Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity.,2
"The lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses of the course. While it is evident that each of the Roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history, saying that it was a Rooseveltian century is going a bit too far. Nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the 20th century. Wagner-Pyser, Glass-Steagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the UN we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights. The only thing that has lasted has been Social Security and that is under attack by a co-opted ultra-conservative Congres",2
"I was excited to learn a bit about using document-based databases and JSON parsing and transport. However, for me the approach in this course was very dry and I found the material, goals, and teaching style to be a confusing jumble. It seemed like each section/module did not feel like a cohesive package, with each one building upon the last.",2
"The material was was too much for the estimated time given to spend on the course per week. The assignments are very lengthy and the grading doesn't always conform to what would be intuitive.Some gems used in the course material are also old versions. There are entries in the db seed data that cause trouble, leading to intensive debugging and modification of given files that require a much more experienced programmer to figure out.",2
Good contents but a bit over-complicated assignments.,2
"An unexpectedly disappointing, and in fact, downright awful course. The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments. The assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spec-test driven spirit of the first two classes. However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some “hints”, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code. The tasks are very (and by “very"" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students. How about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!) pages of assignment for the 3d week? To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair). Took me 44 hours of pure coding time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course. I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst. That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) “a bad one”. I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Mongo and another one on Rails instead. I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete.",2
Excellent!But I couldn't complete the course without payments.,2
Not what I expected. Talks more about the professional settings where conversations are going to take place and not about helping student with their professional English speaking skills.,2
The course is great but beginners but not for intermediate and advance learners. I must appreciate Coursera for providing free courses. Thank you,2
the projects are very hard and useless,2
Extremely basic,2
"This is the only course in this specialization that doesn't seem to belong with the rest of the material. It seems out of place, and too little was done to relate it to learning python.Moreover, learning databases and SQL is easy; rather than taking up a whole course, this content could be relegated to one week of lectures in conjunction with some external references for further reading. Four weeks were spent on this external topic while the more interesting discussion on using python with databases is glossed over haphazardly in the last week.I am a big fan of this specialization and think Prof. Severance does a great job explaining some of the basics of python in a short amount of time, but this course needs to be restructured.",2
"The course was informative and some of the material regarding databases will be useful towards my current job. However, I felt that in classes 3 and 4, Python was really an after thought. I believe I could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignments only required slight modifications to existing code. I was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code. I would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programing knowledge so that I can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cut/paste all the time.",2
"Very basic, rather simple",2
Not enough material covered to make it worth the cost.,2
This course is not challenging at all.,2
"This class was really difficult. The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes (particularly in Week 3 & 4) and the final exam was immensely difficult. Additionally, the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i.e. repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs. I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn't have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class.",2
Although courseware video is well doneAssigment are poorly designed and imbalancedFar too easy on end of each weekLast week final assignment overly difficult and poorly guidedThe sense of progress is very small after completing the courseBiology meets programming from UCSD is better designed on pedagogy and code challenges level.Can't recommend not worth investing time or 50 bucks,2
final project almost impossible based on lectures,2
"Not enough material provided to successfully complete final exam. More detailed explanation needed for newbies in Python and especially for newbies in programming, as it is , I am assuming, target group.",2
"Poor. Fun American English intermissions, that's about it.",2
Too little information.,2
"A bit light in terms of content, this probably could have been condensed down into 2 lessons.",2
"Great start. Many promises. But week 3 and 4 go in a wrong direction. Instead of speaking about Strategy - author goes into unrelated fields. Trash bins as a reference of a new strategical approach - misses a point that it is not a mass product. What strategical decisions did it involve that were not related to marketing? Almost none. Strategy is much, much wider term. Regarding new tendencies... Globalization has happened yesterday... Today it's time to open new horizons in relation to application of IT solutions to management problems. After AlphaGo proved that a computer program is more skillful in a complex game of GO than one of the top human players - it will not take much to the next step - strategical decision making on a corporate level. What companies need to do today? Infrastructure - probably. New organizational structure? - Definitely.",2
"I had rated this course 4 star earlier but, I am downgrading it to 2 star now as the course managers - coursera + CBS seem to have abandoned the coursera while the program is still running and being charged upwards of hundreds of dollars.The final peer assignment date has passed by close to 2 weeks and the grading process is not completed, neither there is any communication from course managers about the same.Very disappointing from Coursera and CBS. For free, the course may be still useful as early introduction to strategy but as paid course, refrain for the time being.My earlier review below.-----Delivery of the course - presentation, videos, sequencing and articles for each video are very well organized and executed. Referring cases studies is good as well.However, the material seems simplified and is very much a basic course and not intermediate or advanced course.Additionally, the quizzes are very simple and have ample room to increase the difficulty level in order to make the course more challenging.",2
"By the end of the course, you do start to develop the ""hacker mentality"" the course writers want you to develop. That being said, it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non-programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers. A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics, but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums. If these really are ""core concepts"", as described by the mentors, one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases (which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources). It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners, given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics, tons of time on fairly advanced topics, and almost no time on critical intermediate-level content.",2
"The ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly. Felt the class needed more hands on learning. Although the lectures were clear and concise, going back to them really didn't help me with the assignments.",2
"This course is very bad. I would like to say this course sucks compared with my sql course no matter how it is structured or how the instructor conducted the course. The instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly. Even when I start, he does not clearly clarify how to start to use R. He was just talking about what the powerpoint shows. I will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners. (0 STAR)I will give a little credit to swirl, a practical tool provided by this course to learn R by yourself thought the instruction of the R program itself. But for the later part of swirl, it's confusing sometimes. However, I learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor. I can't understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl. He said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl. (2 STARS)Overall, I don't recommend this anyone, especially if you are beginners.",2
"Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course. Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures. I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in. I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.",2
"As someone with little programming experience, this course was extremely challenging and I don't think the information taught was enough to successfully complete the course. I had to go to another online education source to teach myself R before I could do the Coursera programming assignments.",2
The homework and the lectures are at totally different level.,2
"The exams and projects are really really hard and make R newbies, such as I, feel very suffering. And these contents are not connect to the teaching materials closely. I think there is large space to improve this course to make it more accessible and learnable.",2
"I passed this course with score 95% finished all quizzes, Programming assignments and swirl exercises. but it wasn't useful that much. the videos wasn't interactive, to much theoretical parts...less practical you can't solve the assignments depending on the tutorials you have to google for the answers and know how people can solve the problems.......I recommend if there will be a new version to put these points in consideration",2
Very poor lecture support for the assignments. So much was not covered at all during the lectures that the assignments were extremely time consuming.,2
"It is just not a good course for a beginner, especially the assignment 2 is hard to understand. And hope this course can add a little bit material on statistical programming or machine learning session in the future.",2
"Good intention but the programming assignments were much much harder than what was covered in the mostly theoretical lectures and the more practical but not as advanced swirl exercises. After reading other reviews of this course, and struggling to complete the FIRST programming assignment, I canceled. Please do not advertise this as for beginners - I think people who have had some programming experience before would find this great, but not for the newbie.",2
"I do not like how the lecturer teaches. It is too theoretical, and from very simple concepts makes rocket science. It would be better to have more exmaple and less theory.",2
"Not meant for a complete beginner. I've spoken to a dozen people who have taken this course, and if you don't have some programming skills, you'll struggle. I'm not suggesting its not doable for the complete beginner, but the time commitment may be prohibitive.",2
The videos do not adequately prepare the students of the programming assignments.The instructor should provide more support regarding the homework.,2
"Swirl package contents were better than the lectures in the videos. The video lectures introduced concepts without any context, making them difficult to understand. The video lectures also didn't demonstrate anything. The Swirl package was much better at ""showing one,"" ""doing one.""",2
"Had potential, but exercises and quizzes do not align with content taught by professor. This is not a beginners course!",2
"The swirl exercises were helpful, but the video lectures and assignments were not. Therefore, I cannot recommed this course. There are better resources for learning R in general and R programming.",2
Not good for people who would like to learn from basics.,2
"I am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here. I studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile. R programming is considered nearly essential skill, if not fundamental, to data analysis. So I had high hopes going into this course.Lecture videos: I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell asleep watching the video lectures. This course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copy/paste text from a command prompt. I, on the other hand, prefer learning by doing. Sadly, all the doing is clumped into the assignments (more on them later). Also, Dr. Peng makes gross burping/drooling noises in the video from time to time. I apologize if that sounded rude, but try listening to the lectures with headphones and you'll say the same. Video editing for pre-recorded videos is not rocket science.Assignments: These were the biggest frustration throughout the course. Imagine you want to learn to play the piano (and you play a little guitar now) and you go to the piano class. Your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall. You protest ""But I have no clue of how to PLAY"", but your teacher says ""All the piano greats learned by fiddling around with a ""hacker"" mentality"". You ask ""Why did I pay $50 to hack on my own?""Off-lecture help: If you take the course for the same reason I did, then thank your favorite god for the moderators in the discussion forums (mentors). 1 out of the 2 stars I give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do. The stickied posts in the forums offer a bit of help with the assignments (not enough, but still something). And they are also active in answering questions. The other star in my review goes to ""Swirl"". You will learn way more by doing the swirl exercises than watching the lectures by a long way.In conclusion, I finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of R despite the fine grades. Very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures. I would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone. Otherwise, stay away!",2
"R is a good to know tool, but so many of these process are automated now. You can do this quite easily in XLS or SPSS in most cases.",2
"This course is ""1-dimensional"" and not of high didactic quality. I have followed several other courses ( also Python in Coursera set up) and this one really disappointed me ( I'm in wk 2 out of 4 now). It is a bit of a pitty that the instructor speaks too rapid ( it is ment to be also for non-native US speakers?). The material is hardly explained step by step. So what I do at the moment: I watch the video and than go to Yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better way.Examples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course/ and the python coursePS ""all of the data toolbox"" course seem to have the same flaws.Of course my knowledge level is low concerning programming ( I am a MD, so hardly scientific educated...). Nevertheless I hope this feedback can be of any good.",2
I don't think the course is setup for a beginner or a person who has never used R...very frustrated with needing to search the internet for help on everything that the course is supposed to be teaching me.,2
"From my past experience, I know it’s not easy for people to take suggestions. But I still want to have a try this time.I had high hopes for this course, but I am quite disappointed. I think Dr. Peng needs to improve his teaching skills.1. Good teaching is clear, concise, and right to the point. So please slow down, speak. Don’t mumble.2. Programming is a practical skill. So the best method to learn programming is to use step-by-step demos. You can talk about a concept for 5 to 10 minutes but I still can’t get it. Use a demo and I can get it right away.3. Don’t just try to cover the materials so you think you have done the teaching, try to understand how your students learn and make sure they really get it.4. If you haven’t covered some concept, don’t assume your students will understand it by magic.A good teacher can make the learning experience effortless and fun, a poor teacher makes it like a torture.",2
There are huge gaps between learning materials (videos) and assignments. Assignments are very difficult and definitely not for R beginners. Also assignments' instruction are a little difficult to understand. I wonder if the purpose of assignments is to exam our reading and understanding abilities or the skills of R!!!I also took courses <Getting and Cleaning Data> and <Exploratory Data Analysis> at the same time and these two courses' assignments are much easier than the course <R Programming>. Writing function in R really isn't that easy especially for an R beginner who only has little knowledge of R packages and functions. I really don't think this course should arrange as the second course to take in this Data Science course series.,2
"Better than the Data Scientist's toolbox, but not a great introduction to R. When I'm learning a new language, I don't want to know about data types and for loops. A detailed example showing the strengths of this language would be better.",2
The course content and the assignments are too far apart. I would have learned more if it was better aligned and there were some exercise in between.,2
The lectures for this course do not adequately prepare students for the graded quizzes and assignments.,2
There is a disconnect between what is taught and what is assigned.,2
"This course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. In the end, it does teach you the basics of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.The reason I still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself. There are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined. The teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides. This shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. The assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.If you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners. I'm quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings.",2
it's so hard for beginners in my opinion,2
"The first 2 weeks have too many videos, which make it difficult to follow. This breaks the flow of the lectures and makes a lot of unuseful repetitions.The slides only have words and are hard to follow, no graphs or illustrations, this means that you rely on the voice of the lecturer to guide you, which is difficult sometimes.Furthermore, the code presented is not run 'live', and results are often lacking, which makes comparison with 'my own results' hard to do.Summary: Not that its a bad course (SWIRL is a great tool), just look for another course that's easier to follow.",2
"This course is a little too deep into programming and a little light on learning the basics of R. I would recommend splitting out the more advanced programming concepts in this course and offering them in a course near the end of the specialization.This course should be higher level and give the user a wider view of R. Currently this course seems to assume significant knowledge of R or programming in general, making it not a good early course in the specialization.",2
"This course is not very ""beginner friendly""",2
"Morely designed on slideshows, not effective.",2
"This course was difficult for me to grasp. The instructor (I believe) assumes that all participants have some background in programming, and since I do not, I have a very difficult time following the examples. I bought the entire series of classes, but need to retake this one after I read some more from other sources and have had a chance to digest what's here.",2
There is not much of a relation between what the course gives (explains with the videos and with the SWIRL exercises) and the real exercices they ask to. Too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area.,2
"Poor quality. A disappointing experience.The lectures are very basic, thought for people that have no experience in programming. This might be ok, but the difficulty of assignments should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.The course does not focus enough on what differentiates R from other languages: just a few videos on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of scoping (very unclear). All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.Finally, the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.All in all, I was disappointed with the course.",2
"Way too much way too fast. Not sure how I would make it better, but I felt like I was learning from googling more than from the course.",2
"This is not a course for a beginner in programming. If you are interested in learning R, I would recommend going to DataCamp and starting there. The lecture videos were not engaging, and the jump from the lecture and quizzes to the programming assignments was quite significant (as others have pointed out). The lecturer for this course does have a pre-programming assignment on his GitHub repository to aid in the first programming assignment, but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well (had to scroll through discussion forums before I saw someone mention it). The swirl assignments were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structured well. The class could stand to be restructured: for example, it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the str() function before our first programming assignment. Overall, this class does seem to be a good choice for a ""refresher"" course if you already have some experience coding in R, but be wary if you have little to no programming experience.",2
"It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors. The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience. Other than swirl, it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before. I worked hard to be able to follow it, but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were, I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it. Disappointing.",2
"Too much ppt and theory, while little examples and real code",2
"This is not an introduction to R programming... this is more in-depth than just introduction... in week 2 we're asked to compute and program to read multiple files at once with very specific functionalities!... this is not an introduction to R programming whatsoever... also it requires a lot of user reading from other sources i.e. google, stack overflow... etc... I don't recommend this to newbies",2
"This course is *NOT* for beginners. I would not have asked my work to pay for the specialization if I knew it would take me 3 months to complete R Programming. I have a degree in economics, magna cum laude, so clearly I'm not dumb. Also, I have non-trivial experience with Stata. When I read that this would be a suitable introduction for anyone, I had no idea that what it would really take was a professional programmer (which I am lucky to have as a partner) to fill in the gaps.Extremely misleading.",2
"The lecture is too general. Not a courser for beginners. But if your are not a beginner, you won't need this, so…",2
The lectures did not prepare for quizzes/assignments. Not a class for beginners.It would be better if he used R while lecturing instead of just talking through the whole lecture.I got more out of the swirl tutorials than I did the lectures.,2
"This is a tougher class than advertised. I essentially had to clear my entire week's plans to complete the first week's assignment, which was by far the toughest. There needs to be more testing on a variety of incoming skill sets. The lectures can also benefit from a recalibration, because the lecturer speaks way too fast for newbies and speaks fastest when explaining the most complex concepts. This makes it tough to learn.",2
difficult for beginners,2
"My background is in software development, so I know a thing or two about writing code. I'm about halfway through the course, and I'm really struck by two things:",2
This course is very difficult for beginners.,2
"The video lectures were not on par with the, in my opinion, extremely demanding programming assignments. I'd say some knowledge of advanced coding was required in order to complete the assignments, or alternatively, lots of time to learn by yourself on google and forums, which wasn't really the point, was it.",2
Disorganized course materials. Gaps in the materials.,2
Assignments do not correspond with video lessons.Video lessons has a lot of teorical concepts that are not usefull at all.There's a big opportunity to enhace this course.,2
"This course is not at all beginner friendly, really hard to follow the assignments and the lectures if you do not have a programming or R background.",2
"The videos were helpful, but too fast. Not a lot of time is spent on any of the functions of F. Swirl helps but not a lot.",2
Peng is incomprehensible. I give up.,2
"Too short, too simple, too theoretic.I found of little interest the slides, partially interesting the swirl exercise, interesting the programming assignment.I would like to have a longer course with more practical examples.",2
"This is NOT a step-wise introduction to R for the novice. Useful in many respects, but the uninitiated to the field need more time, slow increments in project difficulty and more thorough, step by step explanations. I think the designers of the course wrongly assume that ALL R programming should be taught in THIS course which is erroneous; it should be about laying the foundations, on which the student can then expand his/her R programming abilities.",2
"The content and the speed that they teach you R are actually good. But considering that we now have to pay 45€/49$ for the course you will expect more polished videos and quizzes. Some of the videos are just stutters, repetitions and filling words. It's seems like they have been in a rush without decent preparation. Also one of the quiz questions was simply wrong. This should be fixed. Furthermore some of the commands they present are deprecated and cannot be used anymore.",2
"Very disjointed and no clear progression. While it teaches the basic syntactic rules well enough, the functionality of R is explored in an ad hoc manner where the assignments have little to no relation to the week's lecture.",2
"Very essential topics, but the instructor's delivery of content is inconsistent, glosses over explanations at time, ""umms and arrrs"" a lot, talks extremely fast at times. Making this course quite hard to follow.Disclosure: English if my first language. Not new to programming. Not new to MOOC courses.",2
"The Course is not easy for someone who is new to programming languages, I myself with 2 years of programming knowledge with other languages I found it difficult to understand, the only thing I liked about this course was swirl training it was pretty easy, fun, and clear.Assignment was too hard and the descriptions are not that clear specially assignment 3",2
"You don't really learn what you need from lectures. While I agree part of the experience is having to search and figure things out yourself, this goes beyond what I would expect. I have a technical background (heavy database, Data Warehouse, sql, and coding) and it was difficult for me, I can just imagine if you didn't have a technical background.",2
The assignments are highly dissociated from the course material. Also once the due date has passed sharing the best solution would help so as to give insights on what could have been done better.,2
"This is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignments. This course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the Data Scientist's Toolbox. If you have the time and resilience to search out support materials and frequently peruse the Discussion threads, you will be able to find what you need. My peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coding assignments. If you decide to take this course, be sure to do the swirl exercises so you get a feel of how the R functions work. When you grade your peers' work, you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from others.The videos need to be redone. Effective instructors know that students learn by seeing examples, not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do.",2
"I am very frustrated by the disconnect between the lectures and programming assignment in this course. The lectures are very basic, but that makes sense for an intro-type course. The programming assignments, however, have very little connection to the lectures. I have some experience using software with command-based interface (including R) for statistical analysis, and I am relatively good at searching and finding information independently, but this course was way too hard even for me. I might revisit programming assignments again once I have more time and more experience with the application, just for the sake of completing the course, but I kind of find it silly that I need experience with R to pass the course intended for people with little to no experience with R.",2
"Difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming. This is not a beginner's course. Best to take this course after trying Swirl, Data Camp, or Code School.",2
"This course is VERY abstract and I find myself rushing through the videos to get to the practice/quiz so that I can trial and error my way through the project..... hoping for the best. Neither am I excited about starting the lesson each week because there is no real world problem/or data set I'm continuously practicing from. The lessons are essentially a reference guide and not a useful approach for teaching. If I wanted a reference guide, I'd just pick up one of the various handbooks/books on the markets that list R codes and their functions. A better way to teach/present this course is by infusing actual, real world examples or cases throughout the lessons instead of just listing a function and talking through its corresponding activity/response. Ideally, the real world example would be introduced in the first lesson in Week 1 and that data set would be used throughout the course(s) to apply and practice newly introduced functions. Teaching from this perspective would likely make the concepts much easier to grasp and importantly, RETAIN. The lessons, as they are currently presented, encourage rote memorization and rob the students of actually applying the concepts/code taught.Also, I love the idea of this specialization. However, I think the professors need to work more closely with online instructional designers to make the entire series more palatable for online learning. It very much feels as if they have adapted a traditional course on their own without the help of professionals who are skilled at designing online courses. If the aforementioned is the case, the professor(s) should be commended for their efforts, but there is definitely more work to be done to make this an engaging course I'd recommend.PS - I am taking notes and I have some experience with STATA so this type of coding/anaylsis is not unfamiliar to me. I can only imagine how novices may take to the lessons.",2
"I was really hoping to complete the data science specialization, but I have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive. This course in particular was ok, but lectures and application (projects and assignments) had such a wide gap between them I found that I was mostly teaching myself...",2
"Excellent video materials---one of the best classes on this subject, but there has been no support. Missing and incorrect spreadsheets for assignments and no response from TAs for days at a time. This could be a great class if they get the bugs fixec.",2
"Intro audio for each video is incredibly poor.Early course videos have too much animation; it’s distracting.Video 1.3.1- At 4.57 says “Certain jobs and tasks that are not value added are more easily outsourced. But critical functions that are part of the company's value chain or the critical functions that give the product or service value to the customer, should really be outsourced.” I assume that was supposed to say NOT be outsourced, otherwise it doesn’t make sense.Lesson 1.3: the link to the IRS page isn’t hyperlinked. You have to copy and paste.Module 1 Final Quiz: questions aren’t worded well.Mid-lecture question pop up in the middle of sentences and sometimes even words.Quote from video 2.2.2: “Did you know that over 90% of candidates are now using mobile technology to look for jobs?” Then the practice quiz question “What percentage of job seekers use their mobile device to search for a job once a week or more?” and the correct answer is listed at “68%”. There is no mention of 68% anywhere.Videos often go silent for several seconds for no apparent reason. These could easily be edited out.Week 2 quiz: Q. 6 “improve employmentoutcomes” - somebody forgot a space.Practice quiz 3.3, Q 1: “""Tell me about a time when you made a mistake"" is what type of interview question?” - Answered Behavioral, but system marked wrong (but under the answer Behavioral note says “behavioral- tell me about a time”, so obviously it actually is the right answer.",2
"There were some real technical problems in this course. The video sound wouldn't match up in places, and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question. In addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video. For example, one quiz asked what type of question would ""tell me about a time"" be, and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question, but that was marked wrong in the quiz. There were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz. This was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization, so I was quite disappointed. I do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors. Thank you.",2
"This course seems patched together. The volume isn't consistent, even within videos. Some videos / slides are great and full of information, while others are just long periods of talking with one word or phrase on the screen and none of the information put in written form.Some of the questions occur in multiple practice quizzes. Also, there are misspellings in the quizzes. Finally, one quiz marked a question wrong and then, in the comments, noted the answer was right.Further, some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time.",2
Not very substantive. Seems to be a marketing ploy for those on-screen more than to be anything of use to its audience.,2
Topics were not taken in depth and enough clarity. I tried hard to learn in the course but lost track by the end of week 3 and the peer assignment.,2
"Very shallow content - broad, but not deep. Not many assignments instead of the last one. We hear what we heard before. For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning.",2
"This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered. Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization. The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning. I learned how to use the",2
not what I expected for a machine learning course,2
"This is a part of the data specialization; from afar, I would not be interested in Machine Learning because of this course. I will seek other methods to learn.",2
needs more case studies and examples,2
"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",2
Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler,2
Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,2
The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).,2
"Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach. Pure waste of time and effort. Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this ""course"".",2
The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.,2
This is too high level for a machine learning course. You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person. My least favorite course in the series,2
"Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date. Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a ""free"" course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no ""official"" course staff seeming to be involved this round.",2
incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.,2
"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit uninspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out. I found the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject. We also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!",2
"lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of training/predicting: ""use x, y, and z [underlines some stuff on screen]"" and you're doneAlso lots of mistakes/typos in lecture and quizzes",2
"Slightly better than the Statistical Inference course, but many of the same technical and delivery defects persist. With an otherwise high quality program, I recommend re-producing the inference and regression lectures to increase the overall value of the curriculum.",2
To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!!,2
This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject.,2
"I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides. In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text. Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it. 2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery.",2
"With all respect, Professor, if you are reading all our comments, I think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructively. As having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. As when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.The key point here is ""speak to the level of your audience"". Even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon. If no one able to understand you, it is useless.",2
"Difficult, fast peaced and not well explained. Requires a lot of work.",2
The video lectures are really boring and useless,2
Should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme.,2
"The professor doesn't explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times. And why must the videos show the teacher? It distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesn't help understand anything betterConcepts like VIF or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher, at least the SWIRL lesson explains it correctly. ANOVA and ANCOVA are mentioned in the description but they aren't explained anywhere. ANOVA is used without any explanation of what it is.I found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts.",2
"Some topics that are important, are obviated",2
Coursera keeps changing my rating. Not cool.,2
"This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material. Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about.A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say ""Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables,"" but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text. Think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time.",2
The instructor is not good and doesn't explain things clearly.,2
Very difficult. Needs homework problems guided by videos like Statistical Inference coarse to make easier.,2
"Overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world. I think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of 30% applied 70% theory.Also the new format is horrible and TAs are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forums now. The TAs were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on EdX where course staff actually participates in the forums, on Coursera I do not think I have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forums.",2
way to much emphasis on non-data science. This one course covers more information that the rest of the courses combined..,2
I just realized that you have to upgrade(pay $49) in order to submit the quiz and receive the feedback. That's depressing since my purpose is to watch the video and check out what I learned so far without getting any certificate. The policy here bring huge inconvenience for people like me.,2
Appears more like a revision for those who already know the content than geared towards those new to the subject.,2
Teaching style of teachers is very dry and boring.,2
"Vague content, quiz and programming assignments not exactly related to video lecture content.",2
"If you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them, grab some popcorn and take this course, because, hey, it’s about cool robots!!If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate, I would not recommend to participate in this course. The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about. But there are a bunch of quizzes, which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right. I managed to solve all quizzes in the end, but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process.",2
Not the best course of the serie. It is a pity because I had great expectation in this course.,2
I feel that the lecture material lacks proper explanation of the key concepts but the questions in quizzes are good although the lectures should have been more conceptual rather than theoretical,2
"The material in the quizzes is not adequately described in the lectures or notes. Some of the quizzes require 100% to complete with some problems being quite difficult. Most importantly, I do not believe the course leaves behind an effective understanding of the material that would allow you to apply it. I thought the aerial course was much better.",2
Loads of room for improvement,2
"This course covers very interesting topics, but there are some serious shortcomings in the lectures. Too much information is just omitted or taken for granted. Some of the lecturers are rather inexperienced. Reading or reciting mathematical expressions in a monotonous voice without actually pointing to the visual representation of the lecture material makes it very difficult to follow. Better care should also be taken with the quizzes - if one looks at the comments or questions posted by some learners, it is clear that we simply don't understand the question, or a question is answered correctly in essence , but the quizz expected more (or less) precision without stating so . Finally for some reason the support from Technical Advisors was also lacking in the specific session that I did, contributing to my frustration and rather negative experience of what could be a very good course",2
"I think this was a poorly structured online course. Especially for someone who is attempting this course having experienced two excellent previous courses in the specialization. It was good only in few patches but the link was seriously missing. I realize this area is a bit more advanced but with all due respect to the knowledgeable instructors, they could have emphasised more on basic building blocks rather than cramming in so much information which my bandwith couldn't handle it. I did guesswork in almost all the quizzes after week 2 which further adds to my disappointment.I think the Robotics specialization is better off without this course because there is little or no value addition here. Expecting a lot better from the next course in the series.",2
Poorly structured.Bloated.Discontinuous content.,2
"In some ways good, but deeply flawed. The assignments were weakly correlated with the lectures, and no explanation was given for correct answers or for incorrect answers.I believe the authors would have benefited greatly from getting outside feedback from an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student, rather than each other.",2
"This course is a disappointment after the previous two courses in the specialisation. It tries to cover too many topics. As a result it provides a shallow introduction to many topics rather than deep coverage of any one topic. I do not feel I have learnt anything of substance.Many of the assignment questions are poorly written. To name one example, assignment 3.1.1 question 3 has at least three correct answers, but the grader accepts only one of them. I wasted hours trying to work out why it was marking my answer wrong.The lectures by the TAs are delivered in a ""robotic"" tone if you'll pardon the pun. They are reading off an autocue and it shows.",2
"The course has a lot of interesting material, but I believe that a few points may be improved:1) Exercises with Matlab are not programming ones (except for the PD controller). In my opinion, more detailed exercises (with a guide for solving them) would help to understand better the concepts behind the theory. For example, programming a rimless wheel or a SLIP template.2) The course has a strong emphasis in theory. Some of the lectures were boring an difficult to follow. As I said before, a more practical approach would be more rewarding.3) Quizzes were sometimes based on intuition, or topics outside of the course, rather than topics learned from the lessons.On the other side, the TAs were highly involved in the course. In addition, an extensive list of additional resources (books, papers) is a plus.I believe that the following sessions will be better than the first one!",2
"Didn't like trying to hammer in recommended activities into my lessons, would be better to create new material and use that.",2
Definitely a very light course designed for beginners and to promote the Leiden's 3 Years International Studies Program in Safety and Security! Somewhat very disappointing to me! Useful to note the not so realistic 3 peer-reviews awaited in that course... Two of 1000 words and one of 350-550 words! Totally unbalanced!,2
"The scope of the course is interesting, the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine, but the contents and quizzes are very often off-point. A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents. Affirmations are most times not justified at all (""incremental prototyping will yield a feature-rich and robust software""). The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before. The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here. I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material, but clearly that last effort for quality was not done.",2
Could have been more practice than theory.,2
It was like someone is reading a book for you. there was no need to watch videos. It wasn't even helping your memory. Just 2 instructor standing still in front of camera and reading from a file in flat voice.,2
Mapping of software product manager to scrum master is IMHO not correct. Some misunderstanding by introduction of scrum (e.g. customer is not a part of the scrum team).Preparing of a part of an university course by a bachelor of computer science....,2
Very shallow,2
Visuals were not great. Content was a bit irrelevant,2
"Dreadful course. Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments. From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?) and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions. Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student! This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue. (BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.) This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer. (Wish I had a good recommendation as an alternative.)The only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets, to complete specific tasks, during week 3. (This was as much time as I could afford to allocate to this course.)From a 40+ year software engineer, with doctorate in CS, a part-time instructor at a private university, with a very challenging technology job in a multi-national corporation.",2
"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering.",2
"Really disappointed with this course to the point I'm quiting -in spite of having paid for the grade-. It reminded me of my days at the university where I found being a great scientist/engineer didn't mean you were a great teacher. And this is the real problem, even things that should be easy to grasp are difficult to understand -just the opposite of prof. Bill Boyd who makes learning a joy-. Because of this I would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in Python.",2
"Doesn't provide resources to complete assignments.Telling students to ""go to Stack Overflow"" is a serious red flag.Independent learning is an incredibly valuable process, but this course felt more like a series of challenge assignments to do once you've learned Pandas on your own from another source.",2
Need clearer examples and explanations. Slides summing up concepts or used functions will be great.,2
I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement. Please look at this youtube video. this will give you some fair idea what do i mean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast.I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions. Not much clear what is required to solve the problem. it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment.,2
"""Course"" is very self-directed. There are very few exercises, and there is minimal feedback on those exercises. No attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time (e.g. spaced repetition) nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course. Emphasis is placed on the student's teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis. Standard filler course for an empty education system.",2
"Overall, this course is tough for me. In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is ""introduction"". The word ""introduction"" generally means something basic and fundamental. However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard.Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.e. what steps need to be followed to complete each question. So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum. I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.e. Assignment X Tips), which is good. But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures. I mean, it is ""too many"" new things in the assignment. Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is ""introduction"".",2
"Too much focus on databases and database operations, rather than data science.The assignments are too difficult for a 4 week course.",2
"The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments. Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material. I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on. I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those.",2
"Two stars because I have found poor explanations of assignments. I finished the course without being very clear what I was asked, and I lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong. The teacher and the videos are very good.",2
"While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessments is not very helpful. For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup. Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part. In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.)Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating. Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment.",2
"I felt like the test-candidate for a new course. While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the ""homework"" was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution. Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems. Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package....",2
"Videos are fast-paced, material is limited (no real slides or extensive doc). Exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement. Activity on the forum compensates that. Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life. Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started. So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated. I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given.",2
"The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python. That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless. I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow. The jupyter platform is also very frustrating. For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments. At one point, I lost all my work because of this error.",2
"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?",2
"Many bugs, lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments, assignment instructions are not written in a clear way.",2
"Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.I learned a lot.I was challenged.Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).Course did not provide enough support to learners. You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff. I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation. For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python.",2
"The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality. The assignment questions were often nebulous. This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader. The discussion forums were the best part of this class. I'd encourage the course instructors to take a look at the University of Washington's Machine Learning class. Stylistically, pedagogically and content-wise - that's a much, much better Data Science class.",2
"The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with ""busy work"" that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class. While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says ""I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education,"" I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives.",2
"Good material, let down by instructors.",2
"The class was a helpful intro to pandas. But it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow. In the end, i am positive I got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions. There should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts. Otherwise, I might just throw a class up on coursera, give the link to docs.python.org, tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python.",2
"Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming.Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff.",2
No or least support.Course Quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive time.Assignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.Grading system is not easy. You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfied.This i not an elegant learning process at all.,2
"Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time.",2
Very good lectures and examples. Horrible autograder - very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format. Extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretation.Most of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions. The stress should be somewhere else. As a whole poorly prepared course.,2
"bunch of information, but the videos are tedious",2
"Assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance. In general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review. This is far off the standard set by courses 1 and 2. Lectures seem a bit generic and although Liz Gerber tries to make it hands on, the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when Klemmer presents it.",2
"the course is just 5 minute video of an overview of the topic then an assignment,many topics are replicated from previous courses in the same speclization",2
"Unfortunately I found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization. I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling. I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds.A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely. In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all. I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization. I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners. Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.",2
"It is a good introductory course, but it relies too much on networks and could be confusing and demoralizing if you intend to pursue a career in systems biology.",2
"The lecture quality should be dramatically improved. Even at 2x speed, I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos. In the conclusion, Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is ""new"", but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist, and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old, even more than a decade in some cases... so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist. I've taken more than 5 coursera classes, and this has been my least satisfying. ... I do appreciate the introduction this provided, for free, and plan to keep learning in this space, though not in this course sequence.",2
"This course can give you hands on advice on how to manage a sprint that solve a design issue. For my taste most of the information is far too specific and tied to one scenario. It's ok to present a detailed schedule with a number of minutes for breaks; it's also ok to assume a certain mind set for ""your manager"". However, I am missing the occasional bird's eye view, like how did we come to these conclusions and where do other team leads (maybe from different cultures) vary from these rules. In conclusion I would recommend the Agile course from Alberta University instead.",2
"I really like the course however it was too short and generic, and writing a memo as a repetation of the course was not that exhilarating...I haven´t used the discussion forums too much however I was expecting more on building business models...Probably it will be the subject of the next package but still 3 courses were too little as coverage....I really liked the alagories and interviews from real life experiences and thank you for the effort...",2
"While the content of this course was presented in an engaging way, the assessment task lacks context. To then be asked to peer review others based on this is particularly disengaging.",2
"The speaking style and body language of the instructor was quite monotonous when teaching the content. For the most part of the course, it felt like the instructor was just ""reading"" the teleprompter without blinking for several seconds! He did not attempt to teach the students in these videos. It could have been MUCH better if he had used better presentation tools and shorter sentences.",2
"This is a very simple, brief and useful course.The modules are short, concise but do not go into lot of details. Is a good course to audit/browse for free but may not be good enough against a verified option. Anyways, paying for verified course is subject to personal value derivation.While I had rated earlier for the above reasons before the course finished. I am facing the exact same problem with this course as I faced with earlier course.The grading process is badly constructed for final assignment. In fact, now I am learning from coursera staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignment.So please do audit this course but do not be trapped in specialization.Cheers..",2
"The professor isn't that great, and really difficult to follow (high speed, English pronunciation not obvious). The assignment was also really similar to the",2
At times a direct contrast the the precursor class. Assignments too easy. Lectures okay but syllabus lacked structure. Too easy. Wasted time.,2
Lecturer is too boring and volume is too low.,2
"The assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclear/incomplete. Because of this, given these are peer graded assignments, it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently. Some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments, while other topics which are not covered are. All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code. The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API. Sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes. It sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time.",2
"two stars because I really suffered during this course .I didn't like the instructor behavior of explaining the topics he represents.First of all I didn't like the idea of building over one website, if you didn't get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasn't explained in details during the sessionthird the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skillsforth the assignments requires two many details really, Also I need to get the code of other classmates using ""get source code "" option on my google chrome and then run it again , there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server",2
"I think the course, while well laid out content-wise, is poorly executed. I'm thankful I audited the course. I would have been upset had I paid for it. Still, even the free access permits you to use all of the materials minus the major graded assignments. I struggled getting any styling to work with my CSS (files that was provided by the teacher) in conjunction with my Bootstrap. I was unable to replicate what he presented throughout the project (figuring it out on my own after-the-fact), as he would jump ahead in sections while verbally NOT visually detailing what he would be doing next. I was lost for a while. When I managed to correct where he'd left me in the dark, I found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults. I didn't get much help when I asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work. Overall - I'd give the class a C+. I did learn a few things that filled in the gaps with responsive websites, but the tutorials were ultimately not very helpful.",2
"I would recommend reading the docs on the bootstraps website, this course doesn't add much value to just the normal bootstrap docs",2
"A large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you. While the code that is pasted is explained, and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it, I feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses.",2
Awful teacher,2
"I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria. Assignments mostly copy and paste. Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor. Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange. How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application? (In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a ""clearer"" example in the Node.js course. Hunh? Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility. This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel? It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.Just not impressed. I am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me. The only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at Bootstrap. I had already worked with Foundation.",2
"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews.",2
the lectures sometimes used to get very boring :-|,2
"The lecturer is clear, but there is a problem with the paste.It is much too slow. He states the obvious too often, talks VERY slowly, and that makes it hard to stay focused.",2
"This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University. Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot. However, it is a complete disappointment.In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course. That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file. If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine. However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time. Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment. Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer. Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so. Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.Also, the course is extremely slow paced. I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed. Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured. There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand. Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture.",2
"preety boring, lots of code copying.",2
I would like the course to be more dynamic.,2
"This course is not for me.Principal concepts seem very difficult from the first lesson.Professor hesitates, quiz is incomprehensible.So, Good Bye ! I do like blues and listen it very often, but this doesn't help me.",2
"The audio quality of a lot of the lectures are quite bad.A number of the slides seem to be un-organised at times, with repeating information, making them confusing.While all the information seems to be presented, it feels like it could be done better with more time spent preparing and recording the videos.",2
Good info but kind of dry,2
There is alot of advertisement for UBS in this course.,2
"This course is too elementary. U of G is considered to be a top university in the world, I am expecting an advanced course, at least teach us some asset pricing theories, such as APT, thanks.",2
"The videos do not work, the sound disappears and sometimes vision too. Otherwise it could be very promising.",2
"Without a comprehensive background in thermodynamics (which I do not have), advanced mathematics and statistics, this course is extremely hard to impossible to follow. Formulas come out of nowhere and the explanation of the conceptual theory is very thin.",2
"The course was great, however I think it should be more video content.",2
"I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading. I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention ""Prezi"" is subscription service. I didn't use it. Try Open Office which has a ""PowerPoint"" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs. There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions). You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.e. sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the ""suggested"" programs I tried. The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke. Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed. It is not.There is almost no practical discussion. There's plenty of ""what,"" --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much ""how"" or ""why.""Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals. If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you. There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation. If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.So, who is this course for? I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that. If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much ""how."" If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video).In the end, this course was very much a ""self teaching"" course. I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like ""ADSR."" I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, ""Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."" Rarely did it include ""how and why"" to use that XYZ for musicality.The quizzes were awful as well. There's a lot of ""minutia"" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed. Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one. This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do. I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.I'm glad this is over. I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes. Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.",2
"TL;DR -- Good videos but short and not always relevant material; the course should be titled ""A First Light Introduction to Strategy Implementation""The ""Strategy Implementation"" course is rather a first introduction to the concepts. The material is quite short: only 30 minutes of videos every week and no interviews with ""real-life"" managers.The additional articles to read most relate to blue-chip companies that succeeded: Samsung, Toyota, Netflix, Google, and of course the obligatory Apple mentioned in every Strategy course on the planet. However, it would be much more interesting to discuss failures and/or duller companies.Finally, the final peer-review exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every MOOC peer-graded approach (cf. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/problems-peer-grading-coursera to know more).On the upside, videos are well edited and clear and easy to understand.",2
"Material was interesting, but mentors/teaching assistants and the course director were non-existent. Hard to get any significant discussions going.",2
more about the study of terrorism than about terrorism,2
Just for get our opinion.,2
A very good and thought provoking course.It is a re-run of an archived course and sadly a number of reference materials that had been on the dashboard are not reposted with it. Also there are references to discussion forums that don't exist. If the missing material and content were up to date it would be a strong and complete course.,2
"The topic is really good, but the course does not cover the tools or methodology detailed enough. It is too high level and not many examples or assignments.",2
More clear examples needed to make concepts clear,2
"I can't say I really enjoyed this 5 week course. The flow itself was more like ""food for thought"" where a bunch of ideas are presented as sort of an intellectual gymnastics exercise with no point really. By week 5 you are just plain bored. The content wasn't concise enough. It could have easily been a 4 week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic. It all was too high level and never really got down enough to earth. I have done other courses on the same topic which were better put together.",2
"The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared. The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials (e.g., downloadable slides/handouts) available to assist in learning.",2
"Interesting, bit not worthy of the invested money.",2
Platitudes and generalizations. The interviews with real people are the only redeeming factor. I wasn't impressed.,2
The format of the course is not very engaging. The instructor shows slides with generic statements and then reads them slowly. The case studies are quite artificial and the answers are too obvious. I was expecting more tricks how to apply this in practice.,2
"I didn't learn a whole lot -perhaps it is because I'm not coming into a professional setting as a newbie anymore? I found a lot of the examples juvenile - 'wearing a robe to the office' or 'stealing things'. I was looking for more substantial examples of idealogical conflict I guess -stuff that is harder to resolve than being a person of integrity and making good decisions. I know this is just module 1, but the content didn't feel valuable for the most part. The assignments were alright.",2
"The course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class. The quiz was far harder than it should have been, mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas.",2
Difficult to follow.,2
"A lot of talking, I missed some practical tasks / projects to be lead through to practise the subject",2
"It is ironic that a course about virtual instruction is one of the worst online courses I have taken. The content was good, if a little outdated (hence the two stars vs only one), but the course design and delivery were lacking.The videos were excruciating for visual learners (or really any non-auditory learners). The video for Week 2, Lesson 2, for example, had a single static image on the screen for eleven minutes. Words were added to the image during that time, but all in all there were 26 words of text on the slide. Really?!? ELEVEN MINUTES. 26 WORDS. Give me a transcript or make it an audio file. Don't keep me chained to my laptop watching a static image for ELEVEN MINUTES!The instructor droned and was clearly reading from a script. She did not even use the video to highlight key terms or spotlight key references. Whenever she mentioned a reference I wanted to look at, I had to either hope it was on the course reference page (many of them weren't there) or try to figure out how to spell the author's name based on her pronunciation of it. It was just really, really hard to get through.The tests were also poorly designed. What states do x y or z. Who cares? I don't live in those states. Which online school has this policy? Again who cares? Maybe a question about why states/schools have different approaches or how outcomes differ between states/schools, but memorizing a laundry list of which state or school has which policies and practices is useless and did not advance the learning objectives in any way.",2
"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.",2
"Classes are ok, but there is no support at all, no advisors to answer your questions, even if you pay for the course.",2
"There's not much substance. Also, considering there is not video the course seems very non-interactive. Its nice to see the instructors speak and work through examples. Hoping this course was just a quick primer for the R newbies.",2
"The first course of the specialization is very simple. The specialization was announced to be on an intermediate level but at the same time, you need to spend money on a very basic course with swirl assignments pretty much copying the course content. The good thing is that it includes very modern approaches to data analysis and new packages. The second course is much better, nevertheless.",2
"A very enthusiastic teacher, but the information was difficult to follow and some of the assessments took over 4 hours to complete. This made it hard to get the work done.",2
"Very vague, abstract ideas in the lectures. Would be much better if more real-life examples and scenarios were used in the lectures to convey those abstract ideas.",2
"I had done ALL the tasks in February-March - I don't remember exactly when, but I received my certificate in May. The course was interesting, but I needed the certificate for my application to university. Now I'm so dissapointed.",2
"Dr Moerman is passionate about qualitative research and does use some interesting examples to illustrate his ideas, some of which are drawn from his own research experiences. Do note that if you were to take this course, you need time because the assignments are time consuming and the videos are (I think) a little longer than they really need to be. Also, some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way (e.g. one week's assignment requires a shocking 10 peer reviews to pass but when I took the course, there were only a few submissions). This probably means I can't get my cert until the next session starts - if I'm lucky!",2
"The instructor's presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy, nervous, and hyper-excited manner that I could not stand watching the lectures. If you don't mind that, it's probably not a bad course.",2
Video's were great but some of the assignments were unpractical and the tests were based on minuscule details.,2
"Starts off great, but quickly jumps into really dense course material moving quickly between topics with few images or examples while watching the lecturer slowly scribble on the slides. I expected more discussions in the videos with variance between visual, heavy calculations at a slower pace and high-level applications. Quizzes are long and redundant and there isn't enough recognition of the relationship between climate change and thermodynamics.",2
"Very little modelling in this course, instead you get some accounting lectures which are pretty difficult to follow if you have no previous accounting knowledge. Very boring lectures, too!",2
Turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling. The whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling.,2
"The content was redundant at times, at other the dots that were trying to be connected were to wide apart on the spectrum",2
Too much focus on technicalities - not management based.,2
"Apart from the book the courses does not offer me anything. No videos, no active forum, no explanation. Also the assessment is not interesting and there is no much information in the teaching material in order to be able to do the assessment.I am very disappointed with this Specialization.",2
"Nothing but following the lectures, hardly any quizes or assignments where you have to work things out on your own. Also, there's way too much material crammed into four weeks, leading to a lack of depth. I learned a lot, but this was not very engaging.",2
Slow and redundant. Would have preferred a faster-paced and more substantive course.,2
"There's a lack of crucial information such as how to merge AngularJs with all the Back-End. A few chapters such as cookies and session could had been skipped, even the prof. Muppala doesn't advice to use them, but as they're easy to teach so they're explained intead of more imporant things.I'm getting crazy to do the most simple thing: a MEAN Stack Login.So why is not explained the most usual thing here? There are no excuses. Login and uploading files IS IMPORTANT to be learned.",2
"While a lot of useful ground was covered, it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly - the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup.",2
"Pay to submit assignments, GG.All the stars goes to the prof.",2
"This course is very interesting with well thought-out content that involves the student very actively from the first lesson. The assignments are challenging but also very exciting. I consider is a unique innovation in MOOC courses. The professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies. Unfortunately, there was no interaction in my iteration of the course, or any apparent involvement whatsoever, from any TA's or mentors. All questions remained unanswered (except by other students), and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored. The majority of the course's mark (60%) is determined by fellow students using a rubric which leaves little true 'wiggle room' between pass and fail marks. The mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never 'resolved' or explained in any way, which would have been nice after the effort that went into them. I would recommend the content of the course 'for fun' but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned, try another course.",2
Definitely could be more systematic and clear. Sample spreadsheets could be improved in many ways and any attention to detail would do this course much good. Tests and quizzes also could benefit a lot with a revise-currently plenty of confusion with phrases and wording.,2
Very little new and does not include more complex sensitivity analysis for corporate valuation,2
I was expecting an intro course for beginners... this was not it. I'd say this is more of a refresher course for intermediate/advanced users who are out of practice.,2
"The slides are not at all helpful. Unfortunately, this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization. The quizzes tend to be glitchy, and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas,",2
I don't feel learning much after the class. Particularly I think the video should be better made to present the spreadsheet content more clearly and i think there should be more emphasis on important points during the lecture session.,2
"Weak, definitely not what I would call a ""course"". Should have been at least twice as long to give more depth. Also, too many type-in answers for quizzes.",2
This coarse don't worth 80 bucks at all,2
"Some of the ideas discussed are useful & new to me like linear programming and what-if analysis. The content is more suited to this specialization context instead of teaching excel in general so in case you are looking to learn excel, this is not a great course. I didn't like the quizzes, most of the questions added no value. My suggestion to the instructors would be less questions on the quizzes and more relevant to what you teach. I wouldn't complete the course if it wasn't a part of the specialization that I am attending.",2
Not worth the time and energy.,2
Too basic and superficial.,2
"It was fairly easy and short. In comparison to the Duke course, it was way too shallow.",2
needs more clarity,2
This course is somewhat lacking depth. The introduced tools are very basic and I would have expected more content for the prize,2
Too easy for financial spreadsheets,2
I've only taken 2 classes with Wharton online. This and Intro to financial accounting. Financial accounting is awesome. It taught smoothly and explained things well. This class jumped around and didn't give full explanations and had questions on one quiz that we didn't learn until the next week.,2
"I didn't know how to make cashflow assumptions. Also, instructor jumps from one lesson to another without enough explanation how did he reach to the solution",2
the quiz is so frustrating,2
This course is poorly organized and presented in comparison to other MOOCs offered by Wharton.,2
"For what you pay for, this course is not worth it. While I was able to follow the lectures, the material is very introductory and I was hoping to learn more. The lectures are really short in duration and the quizzes aren't challenging. I feel that pricing of this Specialization is purely due to the brand name of Wharton. Please improve this Specialization to encompass more depth in the course material or lower the price.",2
1st 3 weeks were helpful but questions of the quiz were unclear & improvement is really necessary but still an ok course for basic learners.It could be much better,2
It's ok. Reading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration.,2
Very basic course. It only touches the surface of the subject. Most of those information you can find in every web-page on time management.,2
"The contect of some modules of this course is very light and the multichoice tests at the end insultingly easy. I would not pay for the certificate unless you need one per se.I found that modules 1 and the communications part of module 3 were useful. However, the most valuable thing I got from the course was the link to the lecture by Mike Sanders on Advanced Multi-tasking.The reference material referred to is very light - there are no reading lists and one link is to an out-of-date web page. Coursera may wish to review whether it continues offering this course.",2
"The lectures were very short, the contents are too simple and general, does not have the deepness and comprehensiveness for professionals. Did not live up to expectation.",2
This course doesn't help much,2
"I expected more content. The course description says that there is material for 4-8 hours, however the videos are only one hour long.",2
"I found the course pretty basic. It did cover the topics well , however, in-depth understanding and newer concepts (for eg. exercises on time quadrants) could have been introduced & explained in detail.",2
Too basic! Can't even do the quiz without payment!,2
This course is too basic and superficial. I think already high school students can figure out the tips by themselves.,2
"Most of the content was already known to me, and in my opinion it scratches at most the surface. also it only contains round about a 100 minutes which is not that much.",2
"I'm glad I didn't pay for this course.Nothing new, obviuos advice and basic information.Nice instructor, with a clear pronunciation and interesting videos in Module 4.",2
I expected much more detailed and deeper knowledge from the course.,2
The course is too superficial. It isn't worth the mo,2
Very basic.,2
Very disappointed that the assignments are not part of the f,2
Too much of common sense stuff and not much in the way of advanced techniques.,2
I didnt find it very usefulIt maybe useful for professionals just starting work but if you are in a managerial or leadership position struggling to manage work it didn't seem useful.Very basic tips and tricks to manage life,2
"Well explained videos, But very short course. Only 1 or 2 (short) videos per week!",2
Presenter speaks too slow. Still slower than I would like at 2.0x speed. Not a lot of new information.,2
too easy,2
"While this course might be suitable for somebody new to this topic, it was not very useful for me. I have read numerous articles on the topic, so it brought me nothing new.",2
no substantive knowledge at all,2
A little bit tedious/monotonous course. It has some useful tips and tests for beginners in Personal Time Managment.,2
"Useful only to new professionals, I learned nothing new",2
"It is too basic content, I can't imagine an specialization with material that basic.",2
"The information is probably great, but the instructor speaks way too slowly in the videos and it's very difficult to listen to. I switched to reading it as a transcript but that generates as a .txt file which is also very difficult to read as it's not broken into paragraphs.",2
"The material is very interesting, but with only 15 minutes of video a week, it is really not enough.",2
It should be helpful for people who are not working yet or is about to start they first job. It is only the basic to get the idea of how to organize the work.,2
"This course is less informative and systematic than I expected. Although some time management tools are provided, the course is in general loose rather practical.",2
I didn't learn much new concepts or working tips that I didn't know before taking this course.,2
Very basic and obvious things. It's not really useful for anyone older than high school student.,2
The course does not offer very useful material. The instructor speaks too slowly and it takes her a long time to explain simple ideas.,2
too short,2
Very easy,2
"nice idea, but too short, shallow and with too few practical examples.Also a review of some software out there would have been handy",2
This is more like a one hour lecture than an actual course. I was hoping for more content.,2
a bit basic,2
"Some things are useful, such as the table ""task list"", but I would say there isn't enough of this type of help. It would be better if there were more tables like that.Also, more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking. Unfortunately, multitasking is necessary in many environments, from office to home, and even a housewife has to multitask. One of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of ""housewife"" type of work. Examples of this include engineering, molecular biology, chemistry, work in a lab in general etc. You constantly need, like a housewife, put something for a chemical reaction (or start laundry, or put a cake in the oven), and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur. And during that time when you wait, you need to keep this ongoing ""laundry"" task in your head, so that you don't forget to take it out later on time. And when there are more than 3-4 tasks like that, and they all have this ""pick me up and start on me later"" thing, they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources. And the worst part is, it's difficult to schedule them, because you need to schedule not how long will something take, not in a linear fashion, but how long will multiple parallel things take. I would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course.",2
There is not much information you would not know before taking the course. I was expecting more tips and tricks how to change well known theory to practical life.,2
The course is not well constricted to guide students.. it's only fill the gaps.,2
This course relies heavily on self-reading and theoretical knowledge. Video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful. Overall the course did not provide me with the value I was looking for.,2
"This course is nicely organized and has manageable readings & videos. The video quality could be better. It's very very basic information about research. It might be useful to someone who does not know anything about it at all. The title might lead one to expect that methods of research such as qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method would be explored. Rather, this course is a general overview of what research is.",2
"There was very little actual content in this course, and I can't say I learned very much. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't paid for a verified certificate.",2
"Good: The video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism, ethics, and other important considerations for becoming a journalist.Bad: The entire course feels hastily put together. Some of the videos have summarizing points, which is helpful when taking notes, but they flash on the screen briefly, then cut to a closeup of the lecturer, then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you can't copy them down and it becomes super distracting.The quizzes are a joke. They usually consist of 1-3 questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they don't take any thought at all to complete. You could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and ""ace"" them easily.The assignments are also a joke. They ask for 1-2 sentence answers max! Some of them ask you to ""use more than one word"" to respond. I've taken free courses on here than involve 1000 word essays and then at least you're forced to process the information in the lectures. You can pass this course without watching a single lecture and that's a travesty to Michigan State.It is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control. One of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo! The simple assignments are described in 3 different places, sometimes with conflicting instructions. They tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do. For example: the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience, and then you click next and the SAME question is now asking you how you distribute content. Did they even try??In Summery: The content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism, but don't expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questions.Not too much to learn here.",2
repetitive.. long.. too academic... unnecessary terms.... The instructor voice is annoying after 2 minutes. Blah.,2
It was difficult to me! I think that 's more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts.,2
I need more practical example related to mentioned theories and concepts in lectures,2
Too much focus on portfolio investments topic. Would expect more on modeling principles in broader context.,2
Not enough information is provided to pass some of the quizzes without extensive additional research into organic chemistry or other topics. There is no help forum or feedback from instructors,2
"HiFirst of all I just want to write I have a background in mechanical engineering and I know the working principles of solar cells quite well. I just wanted to check out this course.I started this course but I find that it is very difficult to concentrate. I tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and I came up with following:There is too much talking and not enough going on visually. I know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams. It is just not working for me. I have a hard time remembering what you said. I can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick. This especially true for the LCA part, which I don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.I think the best courses I have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles. Afterwards they do an everyday life example. I find that these courses always help me a lot.I am sorry about the 2 stars but I hope you see it as a room for improvement. It is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.I did like when you illustrated Isc and Voc in terms and abbreviations. More stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.If I can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like Michigan Universitys Python learning series. I think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lot.Anyway thanks a lot for the course. I hope you will find a way that works.",2
"I started the course with high hopes, and i was beginning to enjoy the subject matter. But it became very tough for me to continue because the sound in the videos was not very clear. It became very difficult understanding what the instructors said, either because the placement of the mic was not very good or the instructors were not speaking very clearly",2
"Good idea / intend, horrible execution.",2
The Quizzes are written in a very tricky way. It's supposed to be a course for beginners.,2
"The course provides fundamentals as advertised, but the delivery was not impressive. For example the lecturer's speech interrupts, changing words and thought-flow. Examples given were not well thought-out, for example HR was said to be hard-set because it was ""outsourced"" which doesn't make sense. Another example would be where the lecturer said that ""stand-up meetings"" mean no body is allowed to sit down?! Generally, seems to me the course was filmed in a hurry and wasn't delivered good enough for a rating above the basic fundamental two stars.",2
"I was disappointed by the Capstone. I expected we would get some data set we would use to apply the analytics skills we learned. Instead we got an ""open-ended"" problem description with few if any input on Yahoo's operations. The only data available was public data (e.g. annual report, executive interviews, etc.).",2
"I didn't like the professor's teaching style. He took way more time than was necessary to get his points across. Plus the little quips where he's pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show. There were some good nuggets of info, but there was too much filler to get to it.",2
"For a course that requires you to work on your own project, it still forces you to follow a code skeleton outline. This limits the freedom with which to tackle the project's issue. There is not much guidance or support from course organizers, which makes this course not very educative.",2
"The student needed to have a good foundation of statistics and high levels of math to be able to follow the class. I have not taken statistics or trigonometry in many years so I struggled. I would have benefited greatly if there were more examples of how to calculate the models, including the calculations part of it. The professor did not do that and that got me wondering (not knowing) how to calculate the formulas. I think if I had seen a few examples, it would have been enough to understand and keep up.So, more step-by-step instructions on the mechanics of formulas, would be my biggest recommendation.But the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts, and showcasing some industry applications of the models.Thank you for asking.",2
"Its good for the starters but touches very few and very basic concepts. No offense, but the professor could have made it much more interaction by making the better slights he would just read values without even using markers",2
"Personally, did not like the pace of the course. The course can be a bit more interesting with real-life case studies.",2
Just the basics. No concrete explanations of models. You have to study them on your own.,2
A first year undergraduate student can pass this,2
It is very easy and somehow less impacting on real business problem. I hope this Microdegree will get into some kind of complexity otherwise will remain high school level.,2
Very basic and the lectures are short in duration. Not what I expected from this course.,2
"Really superficial overview, I suppose it's good for just familiarizing oneself with assigning the appropriate model, but to shallow for any real carry over to the real world.",2
I liked the course because of its format and material. Basically it was comprehensive.I did not like the presentation and lack of practical examples. I had to force myself to concentrate at times and search other sources for more detailed insight.,2
"Great explanations provided by Prof. Waterman, however for the price of this course (in my view quite expensive) the materials available are quite poor (e.g. the formulas shown in the pdf slides are a mess, not a mathematical summary, etc), and the level of the quizzes is very basic. I would have expected much more from a course coming from Whaton.",2
"This isn't a CLASS it's a workshop.Thank goodness for fee waivers; I would have been so upset if I had spent my money on this course. As someone who has taken Coursera offerings in the past, I cannot cosign the quality of this course.This class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time. I believe if the course was longer (allowing for more space between unguided assignments) the class would be a little better. I understand that the Instructor is barred by time constraints (this is only a five week course, and an opt-in one at that), so I do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lectures.That said, the guidance and lessons are lacking-- even if the class was longer, I would still only give it 2.5/5 stars.It appeared that the onus was on the Mentors to provide answers; for example, the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots. This left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss, since they were planning for hour long pilots. (This, again, is partially an issue of the class being so short; more time to review = the option to have longer pilots, rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days.) Since half hour dramas are unconventional, I asked one of our mentors, JZ (who is great) for examples.The responsibility should not be on the Mentors to find out-- information like that should be included in the prompt; if not discussed in depth, then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time + desire to do so. Especially since the assignment boils down to ""break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion."" In a class presumably allowing beginningeres/greenhorns to participate, this is irresponsible and flawed teaching.The same goes of the ""hints"" that are periodically posted (though again, appreciated!) by mentors in the forums-- those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class, not as supplemental elements. In all honesty, if I didn't have prior experience with writing, I oftentimes wouldn't have any idea what was being discussed by the professor. (And one trip through the forums will illustrate that I am not the only one.)The assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together (another time constraint issue, I understand), but the Instructor's videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time? Maybe in a longer course that would work, but here, I didn't even receive written feedback initially, so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging ahead.If this class isn't going to provide a solid foundation to build on, then it should be made clear, upfront. There is nothing wrong with an experience based / motivation-focused class, but that aspect needs to be transparent. ""We will not provide 101 teachings/readings."" This isn't a class; it's a workshop. It's a makerspace at best. I expected insight and some level of instruction.In one of the lectures, the Instructor literally says:""I'm not a big fan of some of the classic story structures, defining in what must happen in each act. Or the problem, the twist, the resolution, rising action, denouement, fine action, etc."" He does not define these terms, nor allude to them ever again. These are key benchmarks in screenwriting. Definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out, even if the Instructor doesn't strictly want us to abide by them. His students should leave the class more informed than when they came.Unless you're lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing, the reviews don't amount to much, because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment. That is the fault of the course, I think, rather than my peers. Likewise, The grading system here is atrocious because of it; few people understand the foundation, and thusly don't know how to format or structure. So to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis (that, looking through the forums, many students weren't even AWARE of until the first review grades rolled in) is ridiculous. And I am saying that as someone that scored 100% on both assignments that I did stay to complete, so this is not a case of sour grapes, but an observation of inefficiency.I understand that the class is based around ""Active Learning"", but for active learning to work and bear fruit, students should be able to engage with/analyze/synthesize/evaluate/build upon class content. Which necessitates actual, meaningful content. Content beyond my fellow confused peers, and 2 minute videos illustrating various ways of saying ""Write Something Interesting and if it isn't Interesting, people won't care."" Not exactly an astute observation that we couldn't glean anywhere but this course.Honestly, my 4th Edition copy of ""The Screenwriters Bible"" is five times more helpful than this course, and it is about six years out of date.",2
"No real teaching attempted in this course, as far as I can see...",2
"a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'. The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function. Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical. The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros. I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity.",2
"Course material was pretty good, but the lectures were hard to watch. Lots of editing problems, and blurring on the text (gave me a headache several times). Would rate higher if the videos were improved.",2
Felt somewhat light on substance.,2
Extremely superficial. The total content in this course would make a nice introduction segment to a full course.,2
"Not recommended for medium or advanced users. As the name says this is just an introduction in Social Media, so if you are already using it you don't have much to learn from this one. I look forward to the other courses from this Specialisation for more in depth content.",2
"I think the content itself is somewhat too theoretical, it does not usually apply to the reality",2
Instructor was good. Content of whole program was focused on analytics. Perhaps a better title for this course is Social Media Analytics.,2
"The informations were useful, but the videos were repetitive. This whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others. If it was free I would have no complaints, but since it is part of a specialization, I expect more. Removing all the fat each week would have 10 minutes worth of material.Also I did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books.",2
This class was so boring I could not stand it. Social Media Marketing is such a fun + interesting subject that I could not BELIEVE they could make it so dull. Disappointed!,2
The content was very shallow. Not lot of hands on,2
"I wished it to be more hands on, more practical but unfortunately is like reading a book about social marketing. I am disappointed...",2
I still don't have a grade and need help!!,2
"Very basic content, the content in this 5-week course accounts for similar volume as only one week in courses from other universities.",2
"This course is pretty old considering how fast this field changes,",2
Course lacks real example and full of theory. It lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve SEO.,2
Not sure how this course is usefull.,2
Not bad for who have never met the SEO,2
"Content is good. But you need to pay to be able to answer quiz. In other courses of that specialization track you even need to pay to do peer assessments. It is a shame that education and securing the learn success seems not to be the focus anymore - it seems that focus turned towards monetization.So before taking the course be aware that you can not get a participation rate of 100% due to locked quizzes, which will only be unlocked once you paid.",2
"Good content, but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea.",2
"An evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid price.On the plus side:1) It provides an interesting historical perspective of Search Engines, their evolution and the evolution of the algorithms and their purposes.2) Rebeka May talks slowly and clearly. The transcripts also help in reviewing the contents of each lesson.On the minus side:1) It is very theoretical and with no practical application.2) Lots of terminology pops out of the blue without any prior explanation, and would be difficult to understand for a total newbie. Just as a very simple example, backlinks are mentioned several times. What is a "" backlink"" ?? I know what they are, but not everybody does.3) There should be real support material, not merely "" transcripts""4) The Peer review does not make any sense. There should be a real test. The peers do not have a ""higher"" knowledge level to make an evaluation of the alummni.5) It is not possible to take the quizzes unless you "" upgrade"" . Presently this costs $ 80.Conclusion: it is an interesting course, but at $ 80 provides no value.Audit the course instead. UC Davies and Coursera should provide this course free of charge or with a voluntary ""donation""",2
"I failed to figure out how to translate the theory (presented in the lectures) into practice (the only assignment, a website audit). I would have benefited from another application assignment that was a stepping stone to the full-blown audit. Information was interesting, but not sure this is a good course for someone new to the nitty gritty of SEO.",2
"As a web developer, I found that I already knew about 98% of the information presented. The final 2% I could have found faster via a Google search than by watching the lectures. It was also a little strange to me that the course began with a segment on job opportunities and how to begin a career in SEO. I feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the material.I also did not like that the free version of the course did not allow you to complete any of the assignments, as this has not been the case in my other Coursera courses. Not only were you unable to assess your comprehension of the material because of this, but also it meant receiving annoying emails and notifications that I had not completed the module. In other classes I have taken, there are additional resources and content for the paid users. As it stands, I'm really glad I did not pay for this class.I will continue to the next SEO course, because I'm hoping that it will delve more into the technical aspects of optimization, but I am not pleased with the format so far.",2
"Seems to me the professor needs to study evolution a bit more or change his language a bit. For example, he said, ""Evolution happens for a reason."" I know what he meant- that the success of the organism is served by the results of gene mutation - but evolution is a RANDOM event. The success of an organism depends on its survival in the habitat, etc. but it does not depend on the mutation itself. The mutation confers a fighting advantage, perhaps, but it has no will of its own. There were many times the professor seems to be saying that evolution is somehow willful. I direct him to read Richard Dawkins on this subject. I had to read it twice before I got this point - we are inclined to believe that evolution is a lot like us - driven by some purpose - but, alas, no.",2
"I was attracted to this course because it offered the science behind Buddhism and I am studying neuro-science. I have abandoned it as it is yet an other exposition of Buddhism. Neglible science, neglible evidence - just stuff I already knew from non-scientific Buddhist sources.",2
A bit thin on the psychology. References are not hard to find and post in Resources.,2
"Due to change from xcode 7 to 8, important parts of these lectures are outdates. Hence, it get complicated to follow the course.",2
I found the assignment quite difficult as I felt that what we were asked to do was not possible. At least not with Accuracy. No matter how many web pages I tried to analyse and with how many different free tools I seemed to come up with the same 2 issues.....if the page was performing badly (which was the type of page we were recommended to choose) there was not enough traffic to it to gather any information/demographics. However even when I chose a popular page I was unable to obtain the requested information because it was not my website so I was not entitled to view this information - again returning zero results. So I am a little confused as to how we are expected to answer (truthfully?!) questions such as:Who are the main visitors? Where are they from? Where did you obtain this information???,2
It was OK. There is nothing you will gain from this course that you can't get in a single 1/2 hour youtube video instead of 100 2 minute videos here. The assignments were questionable and the examples used in the first assignment at least no longer exist.,2
"Good content, but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea.",2
"This course is not as well designed as the preceding courses in this certification. The instructor's lessons are poorly organized, his activities offer little value, and the quiz questions and answers are poorly written with regards to grammar and depth of knowledge. The author also does a lot of self-promotion with regards to his company, his research studies, and his book.The only positive to this class is that it progresses quickly, making the lack of quality more tolerable. Had this been the first course in this certification, I would have dropped out and looked for a better program.",2
"This course introduce you to some kind of good behaviours to apply to social media. But actually it is some kind of well manners that everybody should apply in social life. Of course it makes you aware that in both cases you should apply the same behaviour, but I found it a bit too logical...",2
"1 star for the course, the video's are longer than needed because the instructor could be telling his stories in a more structured way. There's too much self-promotion (or maybe that's normal in the US).1 star because the final assignment gives a lot of insight, although it's on the long side.",2
"I did not find this course as good as the other parts of the specialisation. There were some interesting elements there but also a lot of redundancy. I don't feel like I now have all the tools I need to do a through, structured content marketing analysis.",2
"I think this information is very dated - Calories In/Calories Out, High Carb/Low Fat, recommending exercise to lose weight, vegetable oils recommended/animal fats denigrated . . . . so many recommendations that have little 'science' behind them, and which have not produced good results for 95% of the people who have used them. I've lost weight with a lower calorie diet and exercise, so, yes, it can work, but it is very difficult. I've kept it off easily for two years with a high fat/low carb eating plan. I've changed my exercise to mostly Pilates when my weight stabilized and I enjoy it enough to stay with it. knowing how difficult it is to stick to a low fat/high carb diet - which causes me to struggle with cravings, even when I am eating unprocessed organic seasonal local food - I hate to see a low fat diet recommended to people struggling with losing weight. I recommend ""The Big Fat Surprise"" and ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" as an alternate view of healthy living.",2
"I think the course is great - I would give it 5 stars. However, the instructor needs to develop better teaching skill. Each lesson is not clearly defined and he rambles on about aspects, which though interesting, have little or no bearing on the course objective.As well, many of the answers to the questions on the exams are not given in the lecture nor in the badly designed slides. Nor are the answers something that could be inferred from the lecture.It is a pity, because it is such an interesting topic.",2
"The course is interesting but topics are sometimes way too difficult to follow through. Maybe the hardest is that there are few exercises during classes to test the given information, so the grading tests become really hard to pass.",2
"Proof reading needed, for the slides and for the quizzes. Overall, this is a low content course delivered in a rather boring and uninformative way.",2
"Horrible quiz questions. I found the distractors to be too similar to the answer, what is the point in having 4 possible correct answers?",2
"This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project. I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on. I still made an attempt to watch the course content, but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance. Two stars for quality video production. Aside from that, I was unable to find much value.",2
Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion. The discussion forum does not work as intended. There is too much noise.They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated. It all seems rushed and not rewarding.I do not think that my outcome of this course has been significant because of the structure of the course and I regret that I have paid for all 3 courses.,2
"I liked the content that was presented. There was some really good advice, like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed. Unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest, where to get data for backtesting, where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm, etc. In other words, everything was kept at a very abstract level, and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything.",2
"Course material and contents are quite interesting but, grading system specially peer review method is absolutely disappointing and kills the motivation. Grading level by other students somehow looks insulting regarding the time and effort which I put to think, write, explain and make videos.",2
"Much blaba, lenghty lectures, but less delivery/content. The second course (from idea to startup) is much better.",2
"While I appreciate this class for attempting to tackle a complicated topic, it was too hard for me to follow, and the peer assignment grading rubric is too arbitrary. Perhaps it is designed for those who are more analytical than myself.. Such as developers... (I am a writer). Although I liked the topic, I will not be taking more classes with this instructor.",2
The content is good but the delivery is not engaging or creative enough.,2
Kind of hard to follow. Explanation is,2
"There are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max, I struggled to hear, while other parts were clear. The course is interesting, but I doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course.",2
I did not learn a lot.,2
"This course is about ""good practices"" for user interface design. If this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time, just be aware that the ""production"" (quality) of the videos is among the worst courses I have taken in Coursera. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy Cybersecurity related course I suggest you to stay away from this one, unless you are taking the specialization in which case you don't have other choice.Content: 2.5/5Videos Quality: 1/5Practice/Theory ratio: 1/5",2
"Reasonable class about designing user interfaces, not much about cybersecurity.",2
"Very repetitive content, provide only some abstract presentation of the technics used.",2
Super boring & clinical presentation of the material.,2
"Course is gathering general information on smartphones, and tells an historical view of smartphones et OS associated.what could help professionnally is more about how to develop apps on these phones, today and tomorrow.",2
"There's a lot of detailed information here, but it's surface level at best. I don't feel I have a better understanding of how smartphones work.Although I am now more familiar with the tech components of a few smartphone models and the timeline of iOS/Android OS development, I am not able to connect this information outside of base facts. I'm not even sure how the smartphone components fit together, or what they actually do.It would be a really interesting course if there were more examples, such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the iOS and Android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model, instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slide.Maybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate, but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted.",2
I didn't learn anything useful!I just didn't like this course at all.,2
"The video materials were very poor, they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief. The course only contained a single project, which although fun, is not enough for learning a new language. After completing this course I feel that I don't really know Swift, but I can use it. After each week you have to complete a quiz. They should replace these quizzes with project, where you write real code. I took this course for free, but I wouldn't pay for it.",2
"The pair review it's really not the way to go. If you don't have the horse power to check it yourself, create automated tests to pass like other courses.",2
"A little bit too light and not really challenging. Just a quick view of the language. The teaching team does not seems really organized : just a quick view of the language, no slide, just someone who is presenting code on screen, no real support on the forum from the teaching team.",2
"By far to introductory, I think that this course should be an extension of the iOS App Development Basics",2
The lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material. Mostly they just introduce a few concepts then point you at the Apple Swift documentation. They really don't go into much detail.The final assignment is good for getting your feet wet but is poorly specified.,2
"Videos are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out. There is zero support from staff in the forums. If you take this course, plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail videos.To improve this course, the instructors should:-provide links to at least one textbook on Swift-add Mentors to the course to help students in the forums-include a repository of code snippets for practice of the concepts",2
ProsConciseModular based learningConsCourse needs more auto graded assignments.Lack of feedback in discussion forums.Assignment language is not very clear.Overall I prefer this course to the android specialization but not for the reasons you may think. The android development platform is more or a less a mess compared to ios. Android studio feels more like a toy than a complete product. Emulation is slow and almost un-usuable with plenty of boilerplate code required to do simple events. Xcode by comparison is very smooth and easy to use. Swift syntax is also very clean compared to Java syntax. But is not without its grievances.At the end of the day you will choose the platform you work best in.,2
Very disappointed. Having coding assignments weekly would have been very helpful. The quizzes often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons. The instructors were never present in the forums to answer questions. The final project asked us to do things that hadn't even been mentioned in the course materials. I would not recommend this course to anyone. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did learn some Swift.,2
Very caotic.,2
"Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.Improve the description of the assignment to be completed. Be specific about what is required (e.g.; what does interface mean? Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code? What do you mean by order of applying filters? Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria. The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria. Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !",2
"In my honest opinion, the quality of this course is not that high. You can expect to learn some basic syntax of Swift, and that's about it. There are very little material each week, and then you get a quiz, which is not the best form of examination nor for learning. I do not recommend this course.",2
"It might be a great choice if you are already familiar with Swift programming! There is a huge gap between the week 1-4 and week 5, in other words during the first 4 weeks, you will learn about just the syntax and idea of swift programming but all of a sudden you have to write a program with over 50 lines of code.I would recommend to offer more details and more practices during the first few weeks from this course before writing a complicated program.",2
"Should be lecture by Professor instead of BS student.The content was not well organized.Also should prepare slides and explain the Swift for more details.More exercises needed in each weeks lecture.Hopefully, this course should improve next time.",2
"Not so impressed with this course so far, let's see the rest of the specialisation.",2
I donot own a Mac nor a iMac and hence I wish to opt out.Apologies.,2
"The Good:The idea of having the lectures in a Q&A style, two experts in continuous conversation about the topic has a potentialThe Bad:That potential is wasted on poorly planned lessons and course contentThe Ugly:Instructors run the Swift code that is written during the lesson and they get a wrong result due to an error in the code. They both agree that the result is weird but then continue to explain that this is how Swift works. In short, they are misleading and confusing you on a topic you are trying to learn.This is of course unintentional but gives you a clue about how the quality check on lecture videos are taken care of. Details here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/swift-programming/discussions/DBk-SJO2EeWNbBIwwhtGwQ",2
The course should have been more thorough and should have been accompanies with good programming exercises as well..At some starting course there was also some cross talk among the instructors. The module on image processing should be reviewed as after some point it becomes sort of boring.,2
"This course needs major improvement. Lectures included errors in the code. While showing code in video lectures instructor was quick to delete code, not giving time for students to view and understand what had just been shown.On Dec 15, two weeks before due date of final project, large portions of all weeks of the course were changed, requiring going back through to complete these new lectures. No adjustment was made to the due date.Requirements for the final project are vague and confusing and I am not able to submit the final project by the due date in about 2 hours. If this issue is not addressed I will need to consider adjusting my star rating.This experience casts a negative impression for me on the Coursera platform and University of Toronto teaching staff.I'm disappointed.",2
"I think this course could be much better without Jack Wu, laughing every few seconds. I would except more professional approach and not videos likely taken on first shot with errors.",2
Poor Quality,2
The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.,2
"Probably guys did big amount of work, but the course looks extremely raw. Half of lectures time is talking about nothing and it seems that there were no lecture plan before shooting the video. It would have been ok if the course had been free, but I expected much more from it for that price.Thank you for you work, but, I think, you need to keep improving the quality of the course.",2
"I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift.The lessons felt very unstructured, unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn't know they were being recorded, this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an ""introduction to..."" course.A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming.To summarise, the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content.",2
"This course was little more than a haphazard, ambling preview of a tiny bit of Swift. There was some useful content in the class but the organization was poor and there was almost no evidence of course design or use of the teaching techniques I expected to see from a major university. The best section of the course was week 5, where they syntax of Objective-C and Swift were superficially compared. That section did give some clear opinions on why Swift should be chosen over Objective-C for new development. The other sections just contained too many confusing, unrehearsed diversions into esoteric topics to be of much use. I ended getting more out of the Apple documentation on Swift than I did from this class.However, the instructors have received ample feedback of this nature and they do seem genuinely concerned with improving the course. Assuming that they will make major improvements for the next round and noting that Coursera's infrastructure is excellent, don't be scared to take the class. The email reminders from Coursera about assignments, etc... kept me on track and kept me in the class.",2
"Not the worst, but I did not think this was a well developed course. It felt like an informal conversation between the instructors with one of them repeatedly calling different aspects of Swift ""cool"". It was very distracting. I also thought the tests were vaguely worded and the final assignment was long and definitely more than the 30 minutes it said it would take to complete it. I am all for difficult challenges, but it felt like the final project was badly designed/described. Un-enrolling.",2
"Poor video quality, weak, ad hoc examples, not well thought flow. Seems like tutors have not spent time on proper preparation. Free courses on iTunesU (especially those by Stanford University) are far more better.",2
Felt like the teachers weren't putting much time into preparation - felt random and disorganized. I didn't finish the course - I'll watch the cs193p lectures from Stanford instead.,2
"This course is not as polished as most other courses on coursera. They occasionally give examples that are too small to see in the video. Most of the quizes dealt with syntax. I don't feel like any new skill was developed in taking it. If you are interested in iOS programming take the University of California, Irvine versions of this class.",2
"Lectures are careless prepared. It's really hard to follow this course without previous background in iOS development, despite it's called ""Introduction To Swift Programming"". There are a lot of small misleadings notes in course materials. Hope the next course in specialization ""iOS App Development with Swift"" would be much better.",2
The lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio. The content covered in many lectures seemed off topic. Quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture. Do I focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics. This combined with the unorganized nature of videos(just winging it) made the lectures distracting. The lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to get(and not just over the weekend).,2
"The course need more improvements in terms of material, presentation and execution. The two presenters format didn't work well as it made the lecture look informal. The material need better preparation and it seems at times to be ad-hoc coding. A few videos were not edited properly resulting in lengthy black screens after the presenters were done talking.",2
"The professors did no prepared the classes. They make so many mistakes in the video lectures and they also laughts in the middle of the course and they send a non-professional feeling to the students. The content of the course is very good, but the proffesors could really do better.",2
"Content was thin and none of it felt immediately actionable - felt like more of a ""hey isn't this cool"" series of videos rather than something that could be used by a professional.",2
This course was not interesting compared to the others in the specialization. The long section on crowdsourcing seemed very unrelated/unnecessary.,2
A bit basic,2
"I've had to guess a lot of things, video explanations were not up to the level of the assignments (I don't look for easier assignments but broader explanations).the last week assignment on crowdsourcing it's cool but for example Mechanical Turk take 48hrs to validate you before you could start, so if you start the assignment on friday you'll barely make it and if you had time until saturday(because you work) you are doomed.",2
"Assignments are not well prepared: forms are not helping either people accomplishing the assignment, or the people reviewing their work.We have to go back and forth to review the question answered in both cases (when filling-out or reviewing), and sometimes notation criteria are not clear upfront.Please review the assignments and improve them, because it was really frustrating.",2
Dry and boring as hell.,2
"I liked fun videos, some explanations and teachers. But the quality has really disappointed :( A huge amount of misprints in printable exercises, a few grammar mistakes in the answers, mistakes in the execution of the online exercises. The part about passive tenses is only about one tense Past Simple. And the whole design is really destructing! Awful typefaces, different styles, different colors. I enjoyed some explanation in videos and fun teachers, but in general, I'm really happy I haven't paid for this course.",2
There is no any Discusson forums in there. It's so disappointing. I've paid for course and unable to ask questions.,2
"A very poor course. The teacher just ask questions in order to stimulate students, but doesn't teach anything. Incorrect terminology (Ah-ah? Please, study Aaron Allston works before inventing other words).Test are cool.",2
"Unlike the other two lecturers in this course, this module's lecture is very very bad. I always felt like coming back and learning more with the other two lectures but with this one I had to force myself to complete the lessons. First of all his English is bad, sometimes you cant understand what he means even with subtitles. He repeats many things through out the course and he tries to teach by asking questions all the time. As a guy who takes and make his own notes, I found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying. It seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera. I feel that it was done blindly and in a rushed way. If possible can you please change the videos and also the script. Please make it more understandable.",2
"articulation needs to be improved, talked too fast, content doesn't give much",2
Very poor content. Everything is already said in last courses in this specialization. Also they didnt gave any techniques or tips how to easier create game worlds,2
The course is very abstract.,2
"I did not found this course much useful. I expected more detailed examples of worldbuilding, but talks were quite vague and unspecific. ""Sit think about this, go learn about that"".",2
"I was a little bit dissapointed with this course because, in my opinion, it is not structured well, it is just an amount of questions we need to think about. It has ended but I have the feeling I still have no good idea about what is world design for video games...",2
few specifics and examples,2
"I was unable to complete this course, because the course required at least two years of programming knowledge prior to enrolling. I was confident that I could learn while taking the course, but I continually failed to pass the quizzes in the second of five courses. It was very confusing and the questions were cryptic",2
"This course can only be taken who have good knowledge in programming.Although there is a assessment quiz at the start of the course It needs to kept in mind that since this course is part of specialization,most people would take it and not all of them are programmers.This course needs a revamp to suit all sorts of security enthusiasts.",2
"The difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent. The first project (stack smashing) was difficult, at least for me, but I could complete it with the information taught in the lectures. I was unable to complete the second project (Badstore.net), which requires a knowledge of html and SQL that is not taught in the course. The third project (fuzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: ""Type this and tell us what you see."" My advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it. Then, if you really need the certificate, pay and retake the course.",2
"I thought the lessons were really boring, there are some interesting aspects about it, but it's hard to concentrate, Pat Pattinson couldn't get me hooked up all the time.",2
"I enrolled in this course hoping to find a balanced perspective about historical foundations for religions and other philosophies. It did include a good amount of interesting material around different systems, but there were a couple of key things that made me lose interest in the course at around week 6 out of 11.First, I felt that the instructor talks about how he wants people to learn to think for themselves, yet I also felt that he himself preaches. Much of the evidence in his lectures is delivered as an anecdote, which might appeal to some (e.g. I could see that happening to me) and probably made the course more entertaining, but didn't do it for me. I felt that the Wade reading, in contrast, was balanced, cited other sources, and pulled in a variety of perspectives, but when I listened to the lectures, I felt that Professor Ogilvie had a tendency to state points and expect people to believe them.Second, on a related note -- this course was not shaped for the online medium. I understand that it's cheaper and easier for universities to just use recordings of live lectures, but that meant that the lectures contained quite a bit of anecdotal rambling (e.g. going off on a tangent on how you should never take charge of somebody else's soul). Another, smaller beef I have with the presentation of the course is that when he had students who were raised under different religions come up and speak their beliefs, it took a long time to demonstrate a fairly simple idea -- despite people ascribing to the same ""label,"" the same religion, they can have in fact been taught very different things. In a live university class, having students speak can work because the evidence is being presented by ""one of you"" (""you"" being the students), and has the added benefit of building community in the class. But in an online class, I didn't feel that kinship at all.I'll make a disclaimer that much of this review is about how I personally felt about the course, and about how it wasn't right for me. Some of what I didn't like, others may like. But overall, despite being initially interested in the topic and why people believe what they do, I didn't feel that the material was delivered in a way that captured my continued interest.",2
"Course is good, the reason I'm giving it a low rating is because it's a little redundant with course 3 ""Introduction to Meteor.js Development"". Some of the features covered in this course I researched on my own to create the final development project in Course 3. So no much value for me here.",2
"Only one assignment at the end, so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code (this seems like a big mistake for any programming course). The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes. You can't put that as a project on a resume, because you're doing 5% of the work with your hand held through it.Worst of all, the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices, like local variables not being declared (so that they become global variables, a big no-no), spacing being all over the place, etc. JavaScript has a bad reputation, and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad.",2
This course was too repetitive compare to the previous course in the specialization.,2
"Review of documentation from meteorjs website.Slow and boring course.Last assignment is where something starts to be moving but that's the end of course :(You could dive deep into Subscribe/Publish, what is below meteor(node.js) etc.",2
"This course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology. It would probably be better if the data science track had an optional ""intro to statistics"" class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology, and then a separate ""ins and outs of probability testing in R"" for those already familiar. This course seems to try and bite off more than it can chew by attempting to be both at the same time.Still, the lectures are interesting and the material is important to learn / cover.",2
"This course should not be presented by video. I loose lot of time by learn with others supports than Coursera.Even if I notice and appreciate the works to produce these supports by the teacher, I'm not a big fan at all.",2
"Sorry to say, but for me as a non-native english speaker, most videos are hard to follow. Its because speaker talks fast, unclean and with bad sound quality. Of course I'm not used to the mathematical english terms. Also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me.",2
It's a very interesting topic but I had to rely on a text book to understand it! I struggled to understand the lectures and reconcile it back to the quizes.,2
"This course is great, but Brian is certainly not a good instructor. He does not explain things well, and articulate examples. I had to take Statistical Inference from Duke university to pass this course.",2
"If I wasn't already familiar with statistics, I would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow. If future revisions to the course are made, consider including a cheat sheet with the notation, parameter abbreviations used, etc. It would also be helpful to rewrite (or at least include a reference back to) the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in.",2
"A lot of the concepts in Stats Inf - although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day - I felt were difficult to understand at first. Wikipedia and some other online sources, and youtube videos, were more helpful but I think the real issue lay in the teaching style. I won't knock Mr. Caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently. What works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirements.My rating is purely based on the content which I think can be simplified by giving more visual examples. I am rating this after taking the 'Regression Models' course and in that course it is MUCH easier because he gives ""real time"" and visual examples of what, eg Residuals, mean or represent. Just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the R code rather than trying to understand the math. Hope this helps!",2
"This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.",2
This course is poorly taught. The instructors often speed through significant concepts and are generally unable to explain the concepts clearly to someone who does not have a major statistics background.,2
"Despite the pertinent content, the way the instructor gave the classes could have been way more intuitive. You'll find videos on the web that can help you with the subjects covered and do a better job explaining the concepts. Disappointing.",2
"The instructors approach in this course is very cursory. He tries to split the difference in going through the mechanics/mathematical theory and practical applications. As a result, he fails at both. I think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures.",2
"I have to admit, that most of the videos confused more than they helped. For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course. I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them. IN KhanAcademy e.g. they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formular wasn't such a big thing anymore.",2
"Concepts are very hard to understand, even with some background knowledge in statistics.",2
"Very poor instruction and organization of topics, very poor explanation of core concepts. I learned more from reading other sources while taking the class than I did from the lectures.",2
"Seemed like a ""ghost"" course, issues reported with the swirl package, duplicate questions in the final assessment, where is the instructor ?",2
"completely missed the explanation part of the teaching. Why use n-1 for standard deviation? ""Because of degrees of freedom"" Only mention, no further explanation. Just no explanations of anything in this course. I looked at the biostats course by the same guy. Same story. Teaching is more than just saying the facts, you have to explain things, lead the understanding. The materials are just not there, not in the book either.",2
Poor concepts exposition with a bad teaching method.,2
"this is heavy material, and I suggest it be broken down to two separate courses, and the author take his time in explaining the various concepts in much more detail vs. trying to cram them within 5 or 10 minute sessions. I know I wasn't the only one struggling to keep up with the teacher after week 2.",2
This course was more like a glossary. Not quite good but practical,2
Teaching material is fine. The Professor's explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations,2
"Not beginner friendly, might be good as a refresher for grad students",2
There are better courses on the subject on coursera and other platforms. It worth it pursuing it if you are interested in joining the capstone project.,2
"I get this course since I really want to learn on boosting. However, I think the course pace is too fast and should be include more 'non-greece symbol'. I have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but I'm still having a hard time understanding lecture. I would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization (practical machine learning is much easier than this). I bet many students will have a problem in this course since it's a 'beginner' level specialization.My suggestion is to 'slow down' , expand the lecture with more drawing/picture explanation, more r coding and get rid of those greece-symbol as much as possible.",2
Taught very quickly and assumes a high degree of math fluency. Only take this if you are either very fluent in math already or have a significant amount of time to devote to understanding the material.,2
"I am left feeling this course needs work. I don't know if it's the pain of switching to the new platform or what, but the total lack of any support from the TA/instructor team is frustrating. Add to that the fact that Brian skips from slide to slide very quickly often not providing adequate explanations and you'll be re-watching the videos many times over.Several of the videos have blatant errors in them, like the fast that the fourth video of a week also contains the entire third video... again.Such things should not have passed a half decent QA test.More than anything this specialization should not be marketed as ""no previous experience needed"". You need to know some statistics. And by some, I mean do the whole thing on Khan Academy first.",2
professors caffo and leek go way too fast and are completely monotonous. the examples they use assume we know basic stats when likely most of us are a bit rusty.,2
"The class needs to be more accessible especially for non statisticians, I learned more from khan academy which got me through this class than the class itself",2
This is the worst course so far. This should be a 2 month course or the course descritpion should be changed to make sure you have some statistics knowledge.,2
The instructor is not very good when compared to the others that are involved in this specialization.,2
Compared to the first three courses in this specialization this course is very unstructured. The video's almost seem to scheduled randomly and a thread stringing everything together in a logical and purposeful way is completely missing. Learning anything from this course - at least for me - is very hard.,2
"This course is not meant to stand alone as a single course, rather is a portion of a larger Agile Development course. I'm sure the information included is very informative, but it references information that was included in other courses. The first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined (which I presume were probably covered in the first course). Also plenty of references to information from other courses (""Previously we learned"" ""Remember the example"").Dropped the course, not that I didn't understand it, but rather it was not worth my time to play ""catch-up"" on my own. Suggest removing this course as a free-standing course, or revising to allow the data/lectures to stand on their own.",2
"The most important part of this course is peer review IMHO. So, I put a lot of effort and consideration into the reviews I gave, trying to make them helpful, constructive and encouraging. But it was not very reciprocal. I DID get a few great reviews, very thoughtful, very constructive. But sometimes I only got two reviews instead of three, and usually the reviews gave no criticism. One review was a single word, ""nice."" I got a LOT more out of the other courses in this certificate. I was disappointed with this one.",2
"There are a lot of kinks to be worked out in this course. The teaching aspect of the Craft of Writing is in the four previous courses, this one is basically write a story, get reviews.",2
"I don't feel like I learned a whole lot, there wasn't a lot of new information presented.",2
"I found that the portion of the class that taught story-telling was painfully over simplified. I learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever, in fact, I felt as though I was rehashing information from a 9th grade English class (no hyperbole). The other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers. I found this component to be useful, but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture. There is no real accountability when it comes to grading work, as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture. In other words, most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments, without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria. It often felt as though the lectures didn't matter at all. Right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story, it suddenly ends. This class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway. If you are seriously interested in writing, this class will have little value for you and I would recommend skipping it.",2
"Such a boring course. No challenge at all, no meaningful example, and in the end seems that everybody grade without any reason. I don't think I'll finish the specialization, it's too expensive for such a poor quality",2
"The content is good but is too focus in the 3 act structure, and don't explain the narration techniques specifically to videogames genres. The assignments were too repetitives and don't add variety or feeling of progression through the course. I recommend the course for who don't know the basis of the narrative structure, but not for people like me who work in the audiovisual world.",2
Poor presentation. Unclear points. Not a detailed walk through about the specific tool.,2
"Not very like this course... especially those videos are introduced by female speaker....we dont have this kind of software, can't understand and practice it....",2
"Bad learning experience. Materials were reasonable, but the slides for the course were not made available, no one answered questions on the discussion forums related to the course content and the only additional resources provided were to buy a book from the instructor...",2
"Hello, I learned some new knowledge about entrepreneurship, and this course was helpful for me. However, there was not any reaction to the comments in the forum from instructors and mentors. I studied several courses online in the Coursera Community, and this course was the first course for me which instructors and mentors did not reply to the questions in the forums. In my opinion, the forums are one of the great features in the Coursera which could really helps student to learn the content better.Sincerely,Omid",2
Not very challenging. Will be more better if there are case studies in the quiz and we answer questions applying the knowledge from the video lectures to the case studies.,2
"I thought most of the discussions were ""____ needs to do this, _____ needs to learn to do this."" Yet doesn't provide a lot of concrete answers that helpful to solve x. And I understand some situations are complex with a lot of variables, but it seems as though a lot of ""environmental proponents"" just talk about stuff and don't give examples of what they are doing to change the world. I think Jadav Payeng (""the forest man of india"") has done more for the environment than all the attendees at all of these environmental conferences do. Courses like these highlight all the problems (and there are a fuck ton of problems) but contain fewer answers. So it just leaves the ""graduate"" overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle. I think I'd rather have a course that asks, why do we wear what we do when its made on the other side of the globe, is that the best for the environment? We need to wholesale changes in how we think about our society if we want it to be sustainable; not, we have problems over here and here and here, and if we put this bandaid on it, that might fix it for a while. I was just very unimpressed and skipped through the program as quickly as I could /rant",2
"Good course, but outdated. The SDGs were agreed upon in 2015 and there are already ajor efforts ongoing to implement them. The course only mentioned the draft SDGs, which changed considerably later on. Therefore, the course is useful for Background Information on SDGs, but not to get up-to-date with the SDG process.",2
Very Informative course but without Certificate. After spending so much time and efforts it should provide a certificate .,2
Basically i resume of economics concepts that can be taken for granted as a prerequisite of the course,2
No structure for the course,2
"5 points out of 5 for professor Peter. 1 point out of 5 for professor Mike. The first 2 weeks were good as professor Peter presented with very brief and sum up the ideas. On another hand, the last 2 weeks were bad, professor Mike didn't do well in term of summary. He spent 70% for introduction of each topic before reaching to the points that he want to make. Most of the time, he didn't make any points. Plus he didn't answer the questions that he asked. I am disappointed. I was expecting to learn more as the course structure was impressive BUT the actual lectures are not covered the topic.",2
Unfortunately there is no involvement academic staff so there is no assistance/support. The course is put out there and students are left to their own devices. The calibre of students is poor and informed discussions non-existent. A great pity because the content on occasion is interesting.,2
"I was very disaappointed by this course, in fact a bit more so than by the ""Unwritten"" course that has run concurrently with this one. I was **very** put off by the professor's simply opening his book and trying to remember what he'd said there and then, in front of his audience, reduce it down to a videoed talk. He needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very, very different from the one he had in mind (if any, in particular) as he was writing the book. If he didn't have time for proper preparation, he should have found another medium for flogging his publications.By and large, everyone who is from the US (I'm not) and who teaches about the US constitution emphasizes its uniqueness. Indeed, they have a point: it was the first (and, admirably, the shortest) modern written constitution. However, uniqueness isn't unique among nations; all nations are somehow unique. Undertanding a nation (including thir constitution) has to involve looking at both hum-drum normality as well as uniqueness. I felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the US revolutionaries were ""Englishmen fighting for an Englishman's rights."" And, indeed, what they created had both the worst and the best traits that England's historical jurisprudence offered. Social stare decisis has been a major stumbling-block not only for common-law countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudence.The course was embarrassingly bad.",2
"Professor is difficult to follow, often repeating himself and adds fluff that can often be a waste of time",2
"too repetitive, and i do not want to submit a video of my self teaching.",2
I was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being. I didn't find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses.,2
"Although the topics are great and very interesting, especially because I am a teacher who face many of the situations mentiones, the videos are very hard to understand and I needed to put subscribe all the time.",2
Could not understand many of the mathematical formulae involved. The topic coverage was good.,2
"Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in.There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term.",2
"Too much theory, not enough practical exercises and too few examples of how the algorithms work.",2
"Interesting subject, but not much content and assessments are way too short. More variety in assignments would be nice too.",2
"Some interesting points of view and case studies. But the material itself is not in a structured format that means you could lose your way half way through the video. Too one dimensional in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors. To summarize, I think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the video/interactivity/collaboration platform to its fullest potential.",2
Mostly just common sense. And the peer review assignments are mind-numbing.,2
"The teacher is amazing, and the content is interesting and makes me want to pursue Law. However the classmates are extremely aggregating and track you down to give you low scores in order that they themselves may succeed. I cannot explore my interests with this sort of setting.",2
"The videos and lectures were fine, but there seemed to be a lot missing from this course. The discussion boards were empty and the reliance on peer reviewed papers left a little to be desired. There could have been more instruction given on how to grade.",2
Dry Material and the second professor was,2
very little interaction in the final project. seems this module does not follow the principles of the earlier 4 with regards to virtual teaching,2
"Very generic advice although the interviews with children's writers were illuminating and helpful. The marking system was inaccurate, for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn't! Good, solid advice about setting character, scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer's block. The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience. Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist.",2
"I wanted this course to focus specifically on strategies for engaging young readers, but it did not. Additionally, the method of assignment sharing is a file upload/download dropbox. I had fully intended to participate until I saw that. As a MOOC, I realize that there could be any number of individuals registering for this course using false information and uploading nefarious scripts that could hijack my computer should I download something from here. No thanks, Coursera. Epic fail.",2
Information presented was too basic.,2
"The course didn't feel as though it was aimed at a university level audience, which is what I expect from Coursera courses. I I did appreciate the prompt that the assignments gave me to actually sit down and write, but so far the feedback wasn't very helpful. I think that there should be much more guidance on how to give good feedback to peers. Reading a good number of submissions from members of the course, I didn't feel that this course gave them the practical skills needed for good prose, but w",2
These were very short lectures without a lot of content. For example the different kinds of publishing were described but no time was spent on how to evaluate publishers or how to decide what might work best for the author. The interviews with the published authors was by far the best part of this class and I enjoyed listening to them describe their writing lives.,2
"For those interested in taking exams, these questions were poorly worded and it was evident that the person writing the questions in English was not proficient in the English Language. The material was interesting and up to date, but much was lost in translation.",2
Very basic. Could be improved by increasing the level of complexity.,3
"I would like more content from this module. It was very slow to take off, especially week one. It was easy and enjoyable though. I would have liked it to be more challenging.",3
"I would give it 5 stars but , staff really needs to start reviewing assignments because there are a couple of bad apples copying the work of other students. We work hard and should not have our work plagiarized, but since it is peer review and not teacher graded, they get away with it.",3
I will rated number 3 because I want to learn more new stuff about protections of my body.,3
Content was a bit shallower than expected.,3
"Interesting overview of group psychology - but in essence just a bunch of definitions and statistics.I would have liked more focus on how the group dynamics works and how to influence these - and break the circle of unpopularity, the tools to overcome the aggressive stamp etc.Also, I found the quizzes often had unclear and ambiguous wording.Generally happy to have taken the course - but did not quite meet the description or my expectations. Off to the next :-)",3
Good overview of narrative and a breakdown of key story elements such as character and setting.,3
"Really Thank you for all the big data course, just a little about the 5th course, Graph analytic, I think can must go to the deeper insight with more explanation, some of the modules was really vague!Thank you",3
"Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far",3
It's way to easy to be a separate course. It should be part of R Programming.,3
"There was a lot I liked about this course, especially the weeks focusing on background and theory. However, about half the course focused too much on the software that could be used for systems analyses in public health. I would have preferred more of an overview of systems thinking and less diving into the nitty gritty of technology. The other systems course (Systems Science and Obesity) seemed to balance these aspects much better - and moved the technical aspects to labs.",3
"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone.",3
"Good, but overemphasizes niche software product (graphlab).",3
"Really a good course for people who suffers a lot in modern society. Some ways to cultivate positive emotions on this course really help me a lot. And the most important thing while learning this course is to practicing and applying it into reality, which is really amazing~~",3
"The concepts taught were very useful and interesting, but the only drawback I found with this course was the confusing nature of the Mini-Project.",3
Good information and advice. I wish it was more comprehensive though. It seemed to just give an overview of each topic discussed. More detail would have been nice.,3
This course was very helpful but there is a need to discuss it more further in details.,3
"I didn't really feel that there was enough material here to make a six-week course, so that there was a great deal of repetition, and very little context of the Roman period.",3
It was a fun but some of the assignments required deep thinking.,3
"I would appreciate a bit more of detail in some topics, butI enjoyed it a lot. Thanks!",3
"Nice course, but very practical at the expense of theory. A few mistakes in the lectures and some bugs in the scripts of the programing assignments that you need to manually correct, but not to bad. Very nice as a basic course if you have limited interest in math and just wanna start applying it. If you are interested in the math behind or mainly neural networks (which are only covered briefly), this is not the course for you.",3
Great video instructions. Had some tech issues on my end. Not really a good idea to try this on a chromebook if you are just getting started. If you know the work-arounds to make the assignments with a chromebook it's below your level. Still very much worth the time to watch the videos whether or not you are going to complete the work.,3
"This is a very good course to grasp the fundamentals of the various forms of energy.Admin detail: one week between exam-taking after two fails makes no practical sense and is detrimental to the timely completion of the course.The course would also benefit from an actualization, with more analysis of recent economic & political trends:- Oil market has historically been cyclical. Need an analysis of past cycles, and a fresh view on whether the current slump is part of a similar cycle, or a new era?- America's insistence on energy independence, how/why Europe views independence differently, how China/India view their own?- Current Middle-East politics Iraq-Iran-Saudi-Qatar, historical and current role of Saudi Arabia in the OPEC cartel, and the reality and dynamics of spare capacity within OPECStudents should come out of this course with their own view of whether this is the last leg of the fossil fuel race (as hinted by Prof. Lucciani in the COP21 video), or just another bend.",3
"While the last module of this course is very interesting and kept with the specialization, the first 5 modules are a waste of time for the most part. Why would I want to learn about AT&T for two weeks? The amount of useful concepts introduced in the first 5 modules won't take more than 15 minutes if unnecessary things were removed.",3
"Sorry but yet again a potentially great course spoiled by the implementation, way too many mistakes in the quizzes, peer review grading systems which in places are nonsense . I hope things get better and I give the the course the 5 stars the content would merit if it had been properly QCed and delivered to best Coursera standards",3
It was quiet mathematical for a beginner like me.,3
Simple and good overview of Data Science,3
"A bit too commercial. Promise the cure for finding a job , but what did you learn ? This course might help you on awareness on your own abilities.",3
"The lectures from week 1 to week 3 are nice and useful to me, but I think there should be more details about the content in week 4. For example, I think the lecture about the Jeffreys prior skipped many things and I did not understand this concept very well.",3
"The content was interesting, but it was too much theory, sometimes a bit borring",3
Content is not that appreciable in terms of technicalities or theory ; But faculty does teach many good things through examples,3
The course was interesting but overall very wide and didn't make a clear point.,3
"The class was absolutely Wonderful, however I don't have the time to go at a student's pace (work , hom, life in general). I was trying to go back and finish week 6 video #4 but was unable to open the course! I want to llearn I wasn't aware there was a time limit to learn happiness. :(",3
"Interesting subject, and well-produced videos.The assignments are however arbitrary and ill-defined, leading to wildly different peer reviews and many who have completed the assignments correctly to be stuck in a grading limbo.Would not recommend at this point",3
"It good for beginners who have no idea where to start in creating sites .But, can improve some of the audios are not complete yet the audio has finished and in some of video are not completely organized",3
The course is too long.,3
"The overall outline are great. However, the contents and requirements of this course are too simple to be integrated as a whole course. I think 1 lecture should be enough. I am looking forward to deeper introduction.",3
"I believe programming need practice. I would prefer to have many many assignments, like 20 on each week, at least. That's the best way to remember and get speed on simple things.",3
The content is good but the quiz and final exam are way too easy...,3
thanks,3
You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn't think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that. I had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own. All of the assessments are done by the people in the course and I thought people were a little too harsh. If someone is completely new to AI then it is a bit much to expect the infographic to be magazine quality.,3
"This course is just AMAZING! I am a composer and I found myself astonished of how much I was lacking, yet, the quizzes translations, man, are so bad, must of the time those where ""Straight trough"" translations that are complete meaningless on Spanish, it's like they simply used Google translate. You might think ""it is not THAT bad"", well there are sections that ask you to determine stability based on the length of the line... good luck with that (Spanish usually takes more words to write the same idea)",3
"The information was quite was good, but the practice and assignments were too easy. Thanks for providing full explanations and a set of in-video examples for every rule.",3
Good and basic understanding of terms.Can be made vast.,3
This course was very informative.,3
lectures should be more detailed!,3
Could benefit from harder assignments or more,3
Decent Course for someone not much exposed to Excel. Pretty Basic information but exercises are good and challenging. Could have been better with more practical approach.,3
"The lectures in this course were very good but I would have preferred much, much more homework to practice the concepts covered in the lectures.Also, I was somewhat disappointed when a certain issue with the course that I asked about in the forums was never addressed by the course staff. Of course, I could have been wrong about it but, but based on the response from other students I was not the only one having this problem.",3
"The course is not really about Functional Programming, but more about Scala in general. I've learnt much more about FP by reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good by Miran Lipovača, and Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason",3
Exercises need to be reviewed and corrected as they contain many typos and inconsistencies in- not at PwC standard!!,3
"Some really good pointers. I would have liked to see more for the experienced person, this was quite focused on new college grads.",3
"Just bare essentials , can be found online in other places for free",3
can be more interesting :),3
Exercises should be better designed and I think that first week of this course and the whole previous one are too basic. They could be assumed for 99% of people and I think it would be a good idea to create an optional preparation module containing them. That would save time and perhaps open opportunities for more advanced material to be included.,3
"It was a very theoretic course.I would have enjoyed it more if more real life examples were compared with all the theory.At some points I found it too tedious, even though I found marketing an interesting subject, I have to say that the last 2 weeks I found it really hard to pay attention and follow the class.Ways to improve it: More real life examples and more visual explanations.",3
The course is helpful.But there are not many practice exercises.It's quite easy.,3
Learn something about the money supply and demand and their relationship with the exchange rate. but can hardly used in daily,3
"I would give this lecture a three because it is a very independent and useful course, but I feel like the presentation skills could have been improved upon and found the information very dry. I really liked the intent and where she was going.It was easy to follow and complete, although there was something missing for me.",3
"Very good and simplified instruction. But I think it needs one more week discussion to improve improvisation. Also, grades are usually late.",3
Didn't learn very much.,3
very useful ; but can be more fruitful,3
Good review of the theory but course is outdated given the number of events in the last 2 years that relate to the information provided in the course -- particularly as it relates to attacks,3
"The course was very well organized, but the main topics of the course were still covered. The lessons needed to be more structured and not so ad-hoc. The final assignment was peer reviewed, but the feedback (based on student feedback) was not very useful.",3
Very informative but at times too technical,3
"Having almost completed this course, I can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ML. Quality and content are lacking. The professors, breeze thru the concepts in few short videos. No further guidance is available. You are on your own.While the quizzes test the concepts learned, no live help is available. Again, you are on your own.1. Some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides. The lectures don't do justice to the material content and quizzes. Some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful.2. Teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions. Students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution. For a paid course, I expect some real professional help.Many a times, I had to turn to google to help me out if I was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept. If googling was the only option, then I do not see a value in this course.I doubt if I will continue the other courses in this specialization.Thanks!",3
"Overall decent course.This course focused less on the theory aspects in the course videos, which bothered me a lot considering I am paying for it. But the explanations were still good for those algorithms.The assignments were good as well. I liked how they made us work on them instead of the first course where we were mostly tuning parameters. Hopefully MOOCs start having challenging assignments too.The instructor explained really well too!I didn't really end up visiting the Discussion Forums for this course at all. So can't comment on the participation from other students or TAs.Future Advice -Considering how other courses offer about 1-2 hours of course videos, I think this course could offer a lot more. One assignment problem focusing on one algorithm, while having other challenging algorithms taught in those videos to be left for our own implementation would help students a lot more i believe.",3
"Disappointed that it's all theory and no application. I know there are a ton of differeint fMRI processing pipelines, but even just to walk through one would be much more useful.",3
Wharton's online MD can not have a course so poorly develop (lectures vs quiz vs material),3
Nice content but a few bugs with the videos and sound track when watching online.,3
"Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute.",3
"Fast, efficient, not very time-consuming. However, the instructor was relatively boring and most of the material was common sense. I came out of the course learning almost nothing, but the certification looks good on my resume.",3
"I found that the five points to learn for each module become overly distracting. I hope the course doesn't face any constraint to get the five points. Otherwise, the course is fairly good.",3
"This course is not for absolute beginners. Even though I passed every exam and assignment, I found this course extremely difficult. I found myself having to rely on other lectures on python and book and internet blogs. This course is not a stand alone course as it if stated.I wish that there were more exercises where you could practice the lesson that was learned. I think each lesson should be accompanied by an optional exercise.",3
"Interesting topic, however the course lacks practical side.",3
There's a lot of material and it's hard to grasp it all. Hopefully that will improve as the course continues.,3
Elementary and entertaining with some unique and creative prompts.,3
"Interesting, but not so much new things to know when you've already learned about healthy food. It's ok.It's quite hard because of the english language. :(",3
good course,3
"Nice course, would be nice to have more exercises and more elaborated, but fair enough!",3
The materials were interesting and relevant. The instructions for the final project were a bit cryptic - it was not completely clear what the instructor wanted. The submissions I reviewed were all over the board and none came close to the grading rubric,3
Could've been much more clear with the examples if there were some loads of practice problems,3
Great course but programming assignments in MATLAB had too many issues.,3
"There are some nice cooking tips, but this is targeted to very young students/parents with no cooking experience, and I expected more than general information on food impacts on children.",3
relative low efficiency to learn,3
It is very basic and boring. Really you can spend 5 min Googling the things you learn on this course.,3
"Audio quality is not great. Also, all concepts could be easily taught in Python rather than Matlab.Great material never the less.",3
"The course was good, but I think that only it's really enjoyable if you have a dog. As the professor says, both the book and the online resource Dognition isn't needed for the completion of this course. The book was really good, but I think that Dognition was too expensive, especially if you haven't a dog (not useful).",3
Nice but required a certificate of participation.,3
"The sections on bootstrapping and permutations were great! The instructor does much better, information is easier to follow (better and slower explanations), and the instructor is more engaging when he is not reading from his notes.",3
"I was really happy to join this class, until I saw there was no video learning, everything is articles. I need something visual. I am sorry but this class is not helpful for me, I do thank you the teachers but please do remove me. Thanks.",3
Quite easy but I learned a few things.,3
Way too basic. Only useful to people living in the US having extremely unbalanced diets.,3
"the course and the lessons are really interesting and the professor is explaining really well. Especially nice are all the videos demonstrating what have been done so far.Problem are the assignments:-all the assignments are about controlling a quadrotor, but a matlab code 95% done is already provided and most of the times the only thing requested is to spend days in find (randomly) the correct values for the controller gains;-the last assignment is again partly about (randomly) looking for gain values and partly about generating a trajectory as a piecewise 7th order polynomial, where the method for creating such thing is only mentioned in the assignment pdf and with wrong conditions. Even with the correct conditions, with a previous knowledge of numerical methods you can go through it, but otherwise it takes quite some time;-the grade is not set properly.. you either take 0points or the maximum, meaning that for just passing the assignment you have the same difficulty as getting full marks.. if you arrive (after days of trial and error) to the point of passing the assignment, then you can easily get full grade with small changes.. which makes no sense;-the explanatory pdf for the assignments or the provided codes some times contain errors, and I don't understand why they are not fixed considering that this course is already the second time that was provided;-the assignments are fully based on matlab and to actually understand something it is required quite a deep knowledge of how to use it.. I work daily with matlab and had some difficulties in following what it is done. If somebody is new to matlab, it will be quite difficult to do even the easier tasks;-the evaluation function for the last assignment is extremely slow.. it took me 40minutes to evaluate the results.. and considering the many iterations usually required for (randomly) finding the gains this really doesn't help.Summarising I am quite happy about this course and glad to have done it, but please fix the many problems in the assignments. I have taken many courses online in different platforms and this was so far the most time consuming one..",3
DEBERIA TENER SUBTITULOS EN ESPAÑOL PARA QUE ASI FUERA DE MAS FACIL ACCESO PARA TODOS.,3
Thanks for your course!,3
"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos. The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance.",3
"Good lectures and content but the guidance for the assignments are not particularly clear. At times, it feels like grading parameters and questions are just loosely coupled.On a more personal level, I found that the deadline at the end of the same week of the lectures does not allow for a lot of time to ponder and digest the information. I've tried a few other MOOCs; they all granted students the week after the lecture to prepare for the assignment.",3
"Very interesting course, although lacks course notes. The final test (week 5) had a few questions which weren't covered in the lesson.",3
its all reading no lectures..was boring,3
I am a bit disappointed. The main concepts would require more explanation. There are too many requests for essay writting and it sometimes feels an infomercial for the school.,3
"Material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative. It gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense. You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of ""cue cards"" so it's a little flat. For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.",3
It seems to me like the course could have like 2 or 3 times more video concerning tasks required,3
"Very basic the first week, good introduction the second and awesome after the third. 3 starts represent the median value",3
"The course is interesting and its staff makes a great team, but I think as an introduction course, it should focus on the History of Philosophy, without entering into very specific fields of Modern Philosophy. The fundamental notions of Philosophy should be available for learners, as well as the great Philosophers from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century.",3
This was a very basic course. I was expecting something more advanced. But all of what was taught was good and clear.,3
Informative but not ideal for anyone not going into business.,3
"started quite good, but slow videos and the last quiz was about just numbers. it is good to know what are the measurements, but if we won't teach about that too, the more concrete informations and not numbers would be more informative and useful.",3
"A nice course about the MAPS approach and the typical difficulties of natural scientists and mechanical engineers when approaching the political arena and dialoguing with stakeholders. I would like to suggest:1) to change the name in order to make clear that it is about the specific MAPS approach and not about ""climate change mitigation in developing countries"" in general terms.2) to integrate development professionals and some policy analysis / political decision making experts in the revision of the course but also in the MAPS approach in order to make it more effective or relevant for climate governance.3) to include (more) content about low carbon development and climate change mitigation strategies in some key sectors in the development context in order to increase the benefits for students interested in mitigation.4) to reduce the parte about the own difficulties of scientists and engineers when interacting with politics and stakeholders.5) to try to simplify the MAPS approach to make it more accesible to governments and regions in more poor countries.I hope the feedback is useful. Kind regards and thanks very much.",3
very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it.,3
really basic info,3
the course stays a bit superficial,3
Howeworks are way to difficult even for someone who has programming knowledge like me and the lectures doesn't do enough justice to prepare students for the homework.,3
not enough content - would have preferred more examples/scenarios that included conflict resolution solutions,3
"The topic is very interesting and the instructor is sharing some interesting data, however I found the way she talks too exaggerated, and the end it sounds like lot of empty phrases, not giving me anything I could put into practice.",3
"A big improvement on the first course. Still, the material is not enough or you should have to do small exercises to prove that you understand the material. But progress is there.",3
I work seemed a little too light.,3
"This course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tenses contributes relatively little to typical academic writing. Rather, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review. But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to pracital writing. It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to ""the"" or not to ""the""). It is helpful to include this component too.",3
good introduction for people who have never do anything with programming. It is really basic knowledge.,3
"It's not a bad course, but it forces students to use GraphLab, a framework created by one the professors teaching the course, instead of using scikit-learn, a widely used framework for machine learning in Python.",3
Very basic course for American non-healthy food consumers. Would never call it a university course. Not useful for professionals.,3
"If you are new to teaching ESL, this is probably not a good course. I found the homework used topics that a beginner would not be familiar with. I did like how they used various links to supplement the course (ie a chapter from a interesting text book) to help illustrate points in topics. I may retake the course after I have a foundation.",3
"This is a very short, but useful and highly practical course. It will help you think about your work habits, as well as introduce you to an array of tools to analyze and make changes in whatever areas in your work or personal life you believe should be more productive/fulfilling. It's very light on the theoretical aspect, but it does offer you some food for thought. And Ms. Meloni is a delightful instructor -- she actually makes you wish the presentations were a lot longer than they are.",3
"This course offers great background instruction on Machine Learning and I would give it 5 stars except for the following:First, there doesn't seem to be any moderation of the session discussions except for help from other students. This was worth a -2 star penalty. This and the lack of any review of linear algebra and vectorized solutions, I think, is giving some students the impression that they should be coding loops in their functions to build and solve ML models.Next, I am auditing the course, and this is the first course where I was not able to submit quizzes. Therefore, I can only guess at my solutions. This was worth a -1 star penalty.UPDATE: not being able to submit quizzes is a ""feature"" of the new Coursera platform. I never did get an answer from the discussion forums, but I see the same problem in other Coursera courses I am taking.However, I still think the course is worth taking, so I added back a star. This is the second ML course I have taken. The first was from Stanford ML course which was very specific to implementation in the Octave language. I got a lot more background information from this course, and I think it is well taught. Just wish there were more moderators that were actively watching the discussion list.",3
"Excellent lectures. Assignments were a little too ""exercisey"" for me.",3
very good as intro,3
"Online video is OK. But assignments are not much related to parallel programming specific issues. One case, this is my opinion but it's nice if students learn how scala solves ""The dining philosophers"" issue.",3
Need to add more examples and contents for this class. Homework is so easy,3
No technical support is provided for VM issues.,3
The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.,3
A good introduction! Thanks!,3
I think that the above course was a little bored. I would like something with more practice and less theory.,3
"The course is really interesting, but I believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing. I had to search other resources to clarify the topics.",3
"The contents of this course will be familiar to anyone who reads popular science books. The course is useful mainly for pulling various strands together, but don't expect much depth.",3
"This is a brief overview, basically food for thought. I liked the small portions this course was broken into, it made it all the more accessible.",3
very simple . assignments are ok. I would prefer it if the assignments would be all applications and programming.,3
"Informative course for anyone not familiar with the ancient Egyptians; The quizzes have a low (50%) threshold in order to pass, but are not always easy.",3
Clear but a bit superficial. Hope the rest of the course will flesh out in more detail the various topics.,3
"Good overview of Cloud related technologies. Too many details sometimes about specific providers, something that in my opinion may not be really useful but overall is okay.",3
This course is intended to tell about other courses but contains not so much useful information by itself.,3
Description could be little more elaborate.,3
"The basic ideas exposed during the course are interesting and good food for thought. However the course contents practically depend on the film and book by Swimme and Tucker; so at the beginning of the course one is shown the complete film, and over the ensuing weeks a particular book chapter and its corresponding fraction of the film is presented again; the quiz (which is very little demanding) at the end of the week is basically based on those contents. I paid for the certificate since the idea of a ""specialization"" appealed to me, but I am not sure it was worth.",3
"nothing special, no significant knowledge gained.",3
"Long and unbalanced course. The first weeks are long with too much materials, that I think, should be separated to more weeks, than last weeks has no any new materials just short discussion prompts. Maybe it is my fault, but I waited for something else, this was my first philosophy and mindfulness course.",3
Interesting and well presented information. I wished the course had been more interactive and had spent more time on the chemistry of nutrition. Also the lectures and quizzes could have been longer.,3
Good food for thought,3
Very out of date.,3
The course's assignments (3 so far) are not very well designed.It takes me more time to search online and on the lecture's videos for information than to actually write and come to a solution. The lecture's videos show very little coding and they're more focused on explaining (redundantly) a key concept.I believe it would be much more easier for other people taking this course later on if the videos were more code-oriented.Greetings.,3
"I did learn. However, some info could of been better explained. I felt like some videos didn't really further my knowledge. And the lack of communication on the discussions by the professor, was quite unbelievable. More participation by the professor would be appreciated. I do understand there's many people doing this, but if other can, why couldn't he? Maybe have an assistant?Otherwise, like I said, I did learn a lot and I do appreciate it.",3
"Interesting subject & Basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but w/o dog hard to benefit. A bit too much talking in front of a wall ;-) Could benefit from more illustrative material. Graphs / Videos / Pictures. Why not show examples of Dogs doing the games, that would be great for people who do not (yet) own a dog. I was hoping to get some insight into problematic dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation.",3
"Too abstract, too expensive.",3
"The course is very basic, it should have more in depth topics or maybe it should be within a specialization of a complete research methodology, but thanks, this is a great help.",3
need more material.. course is too simple,3
Problems with vitual machine for R assigment. For peer review detail evaluation guidelines is need.,3
"good course, but need to pay for tests",3
The videos were very slow and many contained useless information.,3
"There is no discussion forum. There are some concepts made me confused and I want to discuss with some other classmates. Another thing is there almost has no example, teacher just say the principles. I think one or two example for a principle may make some concepts more clear and can be understood easier.",3
"The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous. The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc. to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me. Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently. Finally, the end of lesson tests always have one or two challenging questions which is great. This course has a 5 star potential, so I hope the reviews are being read so they can work towards that goal!",3
"Great course; only limited by the requirement for peers to review the assigned visualization to complete the course. Although I turned my assignment in well-ahead of the due date/time, I had to transfer to the following class because I could not get the required peer reviews (2) prior to the course closing, despite multiple requests in the discussion forum for assistance.",3
"(I posted this review in a blog [https://guhyasamajacenter.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/review-of-the-free-coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-course-given-by-uva/]. Much of the courseware was outstanding. Many of the videos were so poorly done (boring) that I couldn't watch them. (I do not watch people read prepared text in a video. Ever.)----------- From the blog ----------------------------------I recently took the FREE Coursera course, ""Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World"". (https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation) From the course catalog: "" Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present. We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course."" (Note: In the class overview, it is noted that the term ""Lesser Vehicle"" is ""perjorative"" but they use it anyway. ??"")There are many FREE reasons to take this FREE ""Lesser Vehicle"" course (the first of four):#1 - An awesome, wonderful hour-long interview with Sharon Salzberg, one of the founders of the Insight Meditation Society. What an awesome lady. I was not aware that she is also a Dzogchen student. (Did I mention it was FREE?) Worth signing up for the course just to skip to Week 6 to watch this interview.#2 - Guided Meditations by Dr. Anne Klein and Anam Thubten. Very, very, very nice. FREE, it's ALL FREE.#3 - The Science of Mindfulness against the Background of the Scientific Study of Meditation videos with Dr. Clifford Saron, neuroscientist. His videos start in Week 1 and continue through Week 6 in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation. He (and the course) demonstrates what can and cannot (presently) be scientifically proven about meditation. One excellent example: Two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music, one with the piano, and the other only in his imagination. After 2 weeks (I think) of practice, their brains' MRI patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes. Dr. Saron noted that the results are not definitive but still may have implications for the compassion/bodhicitta meditations we do.#4: An interview on ""Buddhist Modernism"", with David McMahan. Very much academic-oriented. One statement, in particular, struck me since, the more I think about it, the more I think it might be true: ""The Buddhist Tantra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the West."" For all the Buddhist monastics that visit the USA and the West to grab donations and go back to their home countries, few of them are sticking around to teach complete Tantra classes. The few that do (and do it well) are having a hard time making ends meet. (That's just my opinion, I guess.)There are also short 5-10 minute interviews with Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro (a short ""snapshot"" of the Tibetan take on the week's particular subject, which was often better (to me) than the 90min-long ""talking head"" version ) and Ven. Tsoknyi Rinpoche (""How does Buddhism change in a New Culture"" and ""Benefits and Dangers of Secularing Buddhism"", the TB rebuttal, as it were. He did note that motivation is the key. Bad agenda = bad results, good motivation will cause good results.)Have I noted the course is FREE? So you can take the course, and the following courses, without doing any of the assignments/quizzes. Watch (or download) any video or transcript to your heart's content whenever you wish in any order you wish. (That assumes the courses are not taken off-line at a future date.) Further in the course description is a blurb that may point to at least 3 future courses in ""Mahāyāna, …Vajrayāna, …and a fourth vehicle, which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”."" If the quality of guided meditations (GM) in following classes are even half the quality of this course's GM's, then that's all the reason I need to continue the future classes, too.Course gotchas:#1. That said (other shoe dropping here), the other half of the course was videos of people reading their prepared academic papers, in monotone or semi-monotone voices. (Transcripts are available. I figure I can read a paper in 5% of the time someone else reads it to me in a video. Ugh.) However, they would probably need the voice of Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, B. Cumberbatch or James Spader to keep me awake. To be fair, the content is golden, although the papers seems to be geared to the academic community, rather than the student community. Books and Videos on these subjects are all over Amazon, YouTube, FPMT, Dharma-Documentaries, etc.#2. The Sharon Salzberg (SS), in her interview, brought up an excellent point. She noted that she and a noted clinical psychology (CP) scientist (researcher) (whose name I have forgotten) were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with ""loving kindness"" meditation as a first meditation class. SS noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to ""calm abiding"" meditation whereas the CP could not change that student's meditation technique to another technique (such as calm abiding) as her research findings would then be invalid. Similarly, many of the non-Buddhist guided meditations that I viewed in this course felt like a physical education or ""How To"" class. Do this. Do that. It did not feel as though they lived the material, just taught it. (Whereas it was patently obvious Dr. Klein & Anam Thubten were definitely ""walking the walk"", so to speak, so were able to speak from the heart.)Interviews I did not watch, that may be of great interest to others, include meditation in the school system by Tish Jennings, meditation in the Business Community (an interview with David Mick), the Burmese meditation tradition in an interview with Erik Braun, the MBSR (Meditation Based Stress Reduction) with Susan Bauer-Wu, and meditation in the legal community with Rhonda Magee.And all that is just the first course. Many of it's ""failings"" may just be my karmic opinions. The course is worth checking out and watching/reading/meditating on those parts that interest you. In that respect, the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done. Grade: B-.",3
"Many errors appeared doing exercises, material needs to be updated - many node modules already deprecated. Also it'll be better if teacher more clarify all the actions he doing. Sometimes he did something not clear and there was no answer what is happening and why in this way.",3
"It is a very neat and organized learning experience. It is not perfect (nothing is), but it is one of the best learning experiences I have ever had.",3
"It was more difficult then previous course. As for me, it will be better to have more detailed explanation, because I think it was very fluent. Thank you!",3
"This could probably be better broken into two one week courses ""History of Phone Technology"" and ""Intro to IoT"". Many reviewers say they bail out in first few lectures because content seems too far removed from IoT. I enjoyed the last few lectures with examples of IoT, but could have skipped the rest.",3
Be warned - practice problems come from a textbook not available online or open-source. Forums do not offer much help or interaction. Material is presented clearly and lectures are well-delivered.,3
"The professor has a tone of voice that is a little monotonous, but it was interesting to learn about memory with movies",3
"Pros: a lot of programming in automated online environment.Cons: inconsistencies in code like changing parameter order in often used functions, changing structure of some variables (arrays become dicts). This can be unneccesarily misleading.",3
Interesting but really introductive,3
"Course is interesting, but sometimes its so hard to perceive the information with such accent :( I`m not lazy to read the subtitles, no.. but they also, from time to time work improperly and its not feasible at all to conceive the information . Plus, its absolutely inconvenient when you provide one huge assignment for several weeks at once! Why couldn`t you make it a few smaller to every week?(( I think I`ll disenroll",3
"Good introduction. But it feels like it is not complete. It is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big :(I feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class... if the university class had only the content from those videos, that would not be enough.",3
Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...,3
"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point.",3
Listening to Tucker Balch talk is a pain. He keeps repeating himself... Not much content in the latter half of the course,3
"Content is really insightful, however, the instructor does not really dive into the details of most things. If you are paid learner, its better to get the whole specialization if you really want to get the gist of social media marketing.",3
"This course is very brief and basic introduction to spreadsheets. It was surprising that the ""pivot tables"" was never mentioned in this course.",3
"It wasn't structured that well, Plus most of had to make a digital marketing report for the first time without even a sample of how industry experts expect to see when they look ata repot",3
"A bit basic, but I guess that's what should be expected of an ""Introduction""It would be nice to get a more advanced alternative course",3
"Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information. Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on. No to processed food!! :)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes.",3
"I like the sense of Humor of Dr. Charles. His teaches like someone of our age, like a friend, I appreciate that. The course will not be a burden on anyone. It's easy to follow along.The concepts taught are not taught in a structured way (although the way they are taught is good). My advice to the staff is that Structure all the similar things and explain them at one place. Some important and helpful things are left out.Overall, it's a good course for beginners.",3
OK course. Difficult to follow at times. The assignments and reading make it worth taking.,3
Too general... extremely easy to solve the quizzes. I would say needs deeper evaluation of the learned materials.,3
"A good introductory course to the world of VC but fails to provide a deep enough dive into issues of internal VC/PE deal flow evaluation, processes. Not analytical enough.",3
"I feel the contents of this course were great, no second thought on it. It makes your concepts crystal clear. But faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries.",3
"This course has appealing assignments and covers interesting topics. The course, however, has two fatal flaws. First, the lectures are a bit disjointed. While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.) As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented.Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.) The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn.I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.",3
Program instructions could be more specific. Make it clear exactly what format the programs output should be.,3
"It's not professional as that one created by Penn Uni. Named ""Pay attention "" which is unavailable now and I don't understand why has it been removed from Coursera?!!",3
"Distracted, useless info and short (finished in 3 Hours)",3
"It would help if there are case studies, practical examples.",3
"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures.The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time.",3
"although it gives an introduction to R, however the structure of the course overall was not up to expectation or objectives of it.the videos were very much theoretical and boring. Introducing too many concepts (although basic) was not related to the programming assignments. I had to google almost all assignments. It's arguable that this is one way of learning and more of realistic. But on the contrary, as I'm paying to get the knowledge I shouldn't be wandering around to understand something that should've been taught in the lectures.Moreover, I think that the videos need to be updated, the mentors need to be more involved in the forums, and the way the slides are presented within the videos should be more interactive or dynamic rather than being just captured lines of codes.",3
"May be we need to more videos with good examples of the topics covered, I mean good examples that go beyond the basics about topics such as buffer overflow and cross site scripting",3
good explanation and interesting content. Lessons learned can be put to practice immediately. The content let's you think about starting a business in a general way also. Negative point: the main point are repeted a lot of times. The total number of classes could be reduced (a lot) and still provide the same message,3
average course not too good not too bad,3
Final project really hard,3
Not a difficult course but teaches you much about Java.,3
nice course at least to start with,3
"I think this course is great as an introduction to behavioral finance, however I think the content lacks depth and is rather superficial.",3
Course was great. I wish there was more coding and more examples as well as the videos showing more examples rather then slides with text of the properties.,3
good course and good explanation by Prof.Shiller but a lot of videos were edited like a few parts of the video were deleted. Also I felt like Prof.Shiller sometimes did not explain all the concepts to the full extent which I felt made it a bit difficult for a beginner like me to fully understand what he was teaching,3
This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit. I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall. The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall. i.e. questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey.,3
everything is there butshould be deeper for experienced persons,3
I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment. Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly.,3
The instructions for using git and git hub left a lot to be desired.,3
too philosophical,3
I didn't like the way contents were organized. It was too much information in a very short time.,3
A good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar. The lectures are well presented and the exercises useful. The element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review. This seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).,3
"Good course on Infectious diseases; rather broad which includes social and belief perspectives.Good points are: the part on the ""social networks"" which enable the student in better understanding on the patterns of transmission; the part on agriculture and zoonosis and their impact on infections in humans.Parts where I expected a bit more: the part on the ""dynamics"", mostly on the SIR framework (I actually I choose to take this course hoping to get a deeper and practical understanding of this type of modeling).",3
This course has some really good material but the way it has been presented is very disjointed and does not really do the job of properly illustrating Functional Program Design. Although topics such as Signal and FRP are interesting they serve little value in day to day use and assignments focusing on Futures would be far more beneficial.,3
"The material in this course is very interesting, and many of the musical demonstrations are extremely helpful. I am glad I took it. However, much of the most interesting material is poorly explained; I would loved if fewer ideas were covered in more depth. The quizzes were for the most part poorly written, and only somewhat correlated with the presentation of material in the lectures. So there is definitely much room for improvement.",3
I think more examples would have been better for the class.,3
The topic was so intersting but the content was not enought practical!,3
pretty basic information with lots of repetition. course is short and really can be completed in an evening or two. instructor is knowledgeable. video of lecture doesn't add to presentation. there are few examples or interactive sessions and most of the time the instruction just speaks in front of a chicken cage. if i evaluate this course dispassionately then i don't think there is much difference between watching this course and reading a 5-10 page article.,3
"This course is good only for newbies and very high-level. No advanced info about Angrular. No tricks. No info about custom directives, $watch, digest cycle, etc. I had expected more detailed course",3
The course is too some extent useful It indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning. One thing I do not like is the testing questions. Some of these questions are poorly designed. Using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them.,3
"Very nice course, active forum, no issues technical or otherwise -but- it is more about science than Philosophy.",3
"Overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Yale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesn't detract from the material.The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.Most of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave. As such they cut out randomly, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does. Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but it's still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag. On one hand he's very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information. On the other hand he's also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance. To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ramifications of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative. While I have a prior basis in the material that helped, I learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system. I would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course.",3
"Videos with guest speakers were unhelpful. Also, quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions.",3
"The information is great, but I think they need to make this course in two phases because there was a lot of information to process and the assignments need more time if you want to do a good work. The other part that I didn't like was that the information doesn't really correspond to what you actually need to do for your assignments, I think the course needs more videos and examples of how to create the required documents.",3
Learnt many new things. It was good.,3
"Great content, but there is no point to keep automated-grading closed for auditing students.",3
The course content applies to R. The teachers focused on the programming language rather than the application of the existing graphs to explore data.,3
It was very interesting and quite simple to follow!Indicative for beginners!,3
"Reasonable, but slow to come to the essence.",3
I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.,3
"The material and presentation are at the highest level, but the course is lacking real life examples, and contexts.",3
"Good course overall. There tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands. Also, they don't seem to be updating the material. Many lectures are several years old and still have typos in them.",3
"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3
"For most people this might be four stars. There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard OD/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course. If you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value. For me this was pretty stock",3
Quite advanced in contrast to the rest of this specialization!,3
There is not support in the forum,3
"Interesting online course as introduction with brief concepts and definitions on diplomacy, its role, influence and interaction in the modern world. Recommend others to attend this online course to gain required intro knowledge on diplomacy.",3
It is useful!,3
IMHO it's better to reduce the scope but provide more details of key technologies. Final assignment is not well explained.,3
"This has been a wonderful course. It not only equips one with financial knowledge for the corporate world but on a personal level. I believe that through this course, I have placed in a better position to make sound investment decisions. The course is worth repeating",3
Did not find it really helpful ...may be the way I expected it was different. Also may be because of my engineering approach towards management. I don't know...But thank you for putting this up and giving me a head start into innovative ideas for starting a new business.,3
While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course. I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources. Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.,3
"Mostly common sense, but it is a good reinforcement. I like listening to the stories/examples but they could have been shorter and the course would have felt like a more efficient use of time.",3
"Very basic dive into social, feels like it was structured for an older audience.",3
"This course is OK for introduction if you're not already familiar with the IoT devices and embedded systems. But if you already have done some projects in IoT and Embedded systems and are familiar with what they are then you don't need this course. This course is designed for a complete beginner who doesn't have any idea what IoT and embedded systems are (and now that you're researching about a course on IoT you probably have an idea what they are) and as a guy who had already done some projects in this area in undergrad, I found the content to be very simple and lacking any new things to add to my knowledge. But if you are a complete beginner then go for it.",3
"Great course. Felt a little salesy at times, with all the monitoring products features (some which wouldn't work due to changes in UI or incompatibility with my computer). But overall a great overview of monitoring software and the importance of understanding your audience.",3
"Great theme for a course, perfect idea, but I had some issues with execution of it. So, these are the issues:",3
Really basic course. Not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera,3
"A solid course for those who require a refresher on certain grammar rules. But, in my opinion, the course should go deeper in the different parts of the English grammar. For example, what are gerunds or infinitives? Still a good course though! I really enjoyed the teacher, as well.",3
The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point. But that point is very limited. The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student/TA/teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning.,3
More theoretical. Analytical and Intuition is not much developed. Good for getting familiar with switch mode converter circuits.,3
This course is way too simple and too slow. Probably good for someone who has never done programming before.,3
The course is good. I just do not give five stars because we have to pay to atempt pass.,3
Updated and entertaining!!,3
I am thinking that the teacher can be a little bit dynamic and energetic.,3
Materials (video and written) only partially prepare the student for the quizzes and course projects.,3
"This course is for you if you really don't know anything about Machine Learning and nothing about Python. If you do know something about it, look for a different course.I learned the most from lesson 5 and 6 about recommenders and deep learning because I knew nothing about these subjects.The programming exercises are disappointing: just cut and paste. I found this demotivating.",3
informative but somewhat redundant. You can learn this stuff just fine at a stable. Tedious course.,3
"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of ""data product"") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..",3
"A nice introduction to the three plotting systems in R. The second part is devoted to clustering, but it is not detailed enough to be really useful.",3
"Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments. A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working). I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera.",3
very basic,3
"Not bad for refreshing your memory, as in my case - I already received the information while studied in academy, and new key principles but overall memory was shady and needed to be refreshed. But to speedy for a newbie in the area, pace could have been slower.",3
the pace was too fast. it would have been nice if there was any a complete but simple example after teaching each concept. specifically regarding I2C everything was in rush.,3
"It´s a very good course, but when we get to the part of really generating the app, I had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course.",3
The course is too short and I didn't learn much.,3
"content is great and direct to the point. But 2 disappointing factors could have been avoided to make this course perfect1- sound is almost in one ear which can make you feel dizzy if you are using headset.2- instructor is reading everything like a robot. Very fast , no passion or whatsoever.I guess 3 stars is fair enough.",3
"The content is good but I see some space for improvements in the structure and delivery. I would like to just give positive feedback: 1) the videos and power point slides are broken in too small parts. Each movie/power point starts with the same advertisement and music and it is taking time and attention. Suggestion is to reduce the nr. of videos/presentation to just one or two. 2) for some reason the teacher is looking for my ""rigth side behind my shoulders"" and not ""to my eyes"". I guess there is a small mistake on the camera positioning. It results in loosing the eye contact. 3) There is no ""call to"" go to forum for open discussion. There are no suggestions to topics to be discussed as well. All the forum sessions are empty. The course shall ask comments on the forum like the other courses do. Apart of that small issues, overall the content is quite important and the instructor is good.",3
"Too long for learning so little. I have learned more while reading a book for 3 hours, than with this course for 4 weeks. But anyway, it was helpful, because the more tasks you complete, the better you get.",3
I learned a lot of things related to journalism from such valuable course.,3
"I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part. What I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials. I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y. I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time. But I did like all other aspects of this course, including the Taco Bell insight, as well as the details on Social Mention and the other free web applications that is more pertinent to future social work.",3
Good interesting material but the quizzes were badly designed and did not test concepts well.,3
The course is too much focused on the U.S.,3
I have learnt some basic knowledge about dog's congnition. It may be more interesting if I have a dog to take part in these experments.,3
"Came to know some basic research strategies. Enjoyed the assignments. Good course, catered for grad students but Undergrads can also benefit from the Reading material provided.",3
"It was a short and good course. It has videos of good quality, short examples and talks. Every week it has lecture slides, articles about the week. But It was really short and contain too little information and subject. I hope that you will add more information. It was helpful to me and I hope that It help more to another students.",3
Needs Improvement.Lecture and associated staff should participate more in the discussion forums.,3
The video lectures are not engaging at all.,3
"Interesting course, however more examples could be included",3
"Peer-graded assignments are bad for multiple reasons. Most important one -- If I'm paying for this course I expect my work will be verified by skilled people, not by other ""students"".",3
"the lectures are full of the Prof misspeaking, this leads to you not knowing how to complete the task because the Prof can NOT communicate properly to us while we listening to the lectures... it seems like they completely missed the fact that NONE of us are data scientists...Now your Audience......",3
The links provided are informative.,3
This course is for newbee only. If you already spent some time on topics like time-management or personal effectiveness you probably won't get a lot of new knowledge in this course. But for the beginners it is ok.,3
Too little information and too basic.,3
"Trying to cover many subjects and diving deep into less interesting areas.The lectures themselves are very clear and easy to understand, accompanies with good decks.",3
"The topics are great, the material is not really polished: the lectures are from previous courses and they reorganised material without redoing anything, which is needed in several points. Many explanations could be improved greatly.",3
To simple with little examples,3
Good intro,3
"Not that bad I've might have learned more visiting other MOOC like Openclassrooms where they give us more information about coding. This course is just showing the basic, not as complete as other online course platform where they show you how to insert video, contact form and audio.",3
Missed Agile Framework and other emerging techniques.,3
"Too much of the content is already contained in the courses ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"" and ""Principles of Reactive Programming"". Would be nice to have some new assignments.",3
"The staff of this course is really nice, that's the best part of it. Unfortunately, in my opinion this course is not intended for real beginners. From class one I struggled trying to understand what was going on. This may be because instead of just using a typical ide like eclipse or netbeans, they use bluejay, which works different than the rest of ides. In addition, programs used in the course are pretty confusing (If you know 0 Java). I learned most of the basic concepts (classes, methods) for whole week 1 from a single 15 minute video-course from youtube without all the struggling. As I mentioned this only applies if you are a total newbie, if you already know some Java I think you'll be fine.",3
"Content wise this course is excellent, quant finance enthusiasts would love this course. Truth be told this is an insanely difficult MOOC to pass/complete, not because its hard, lets face it, the contents are very advanced and its assumed that students would have background in advanced finance, but the problem lies in the fact that the professor does not explain the topics well enough. The professor might be excellent in this field but simply can't explain well enough, he is mostly reading his notes/slides with a few drawings. Second problem is the notations used in the course is extremely confusing, it makes maths look scary. This could have been a the best MOOC on Coursera but the professor's explanation is simply not upto the mark.",3
Overall informative. Some parts of the lecture was confusing for beginners. The voice needs to be a little louder.,3
This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.,3
"I learnt much but only rated 3 stars because students are unable to submit their assignments or receive peer group or mentor feedback unless a payment is made. The previous writing course I completed with Coursera did not have such restrictions - you only had to pay for the certificate if wanted. However, thank you for free access to the content",3
"homework assigments in matlab are way too painfulthinking about if i should add x0 = 1 or not, X or X', how to sum over i,j,k, that was ok in 2010 but in 2016 there are tools that will spare us such details",3
The content could have digged deeper a bit more and the assignments could have been harder.,3
We need less lectures and more application based courses.,3
Good basic course,3
"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3
"I would have liked the course to have been more hands on. I would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilized.Ex:Hypothetical situations to apply course content to.Group assignments with real time chat.Better formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videos.Also, I feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used, which wasn't remedied by referencing the dictionary.",3
"interesting topic, but teaching is not so attractive.",3
"I found the modules repetitive and felt the course could have been shorter, but i did take away some useful tools and it did reinforce some good practices i was already doing.",3
Good Cloud Compyting and CDN lectures and material.Lack of practical examples and use cases in Big Data track.,3
"Lectures themselves were OK, but presentation needs work. Intro session was very repetitive. Lot of jargon introduced without explanation. Pop-ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them. Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion. A minor nitpick: course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting, but I only saw one.",3
"brought up some good concept inside, like ""tidy data"", but not in detail, how to grab data from different source shouldn't be difficult. should have more focus on talking about data.table, ""tidy data"" principles etc.",3
Need to include more student project design in the course,3
"I think that the course is good but the assignements are totally not at the same level of the explanations, except for the last assignement. The last assigment provided more information and more hints.",3
"I spent a year coding, working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time. I had the same exact learning issues as before. Luckily I had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exams. Swirl() is great.",3
"Few good ideas, too much repetition of the obvious.",3
Very informative although its a little bit too theoritical.,3
"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra.Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying.Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself).",3
"It's a good course and the contents are very helpful. There are important components like negativity bias and loving-kindness meditation. However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion. Take another example, ""What is Love"" session clearly depends an individual's own view. It contradicts ""triangular theory of love"" and the lecturer doesn't even explain why.",3
Some of the videos weren't as clear as the previous course's videos. I suggest less gimmicks and more focus on learning the history. I will admit there were times I was lost on the quizzes because the videos weren't clear enough.,3
This course is good for those people who has never program in Python. But for experience people there is nothing new in this course.I would really appreciate if1) the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful2) what a person would achieve after completion of a course .,3
More assignments would help reinforce learning,3
I expected a little more from this.,3
"It is a super-short course and is helpful mainly to give one an idea of what software product management means. I found the lectures on Agile principles, etc., very theoretical and textbook-style -- not too interesting.",3
Good one,3
That's the best course of the entire specialisation.,3
This is good for new born managers,3
"Several errors on the correction of exercises, not so deep material about the statistical analysis.",3
"Easier than expected. Much was common sense, although it was well put together.",3
"I would prefer if the course lasted 6 weeks so we can get a better understanding in theory and practice every single bit of the code. It was a nice ride in general and I liked it. The last exercise was hard, it could have been a little easier.",3
It is useful to get to know the software that staticians use and some review about them but it doesn't teach you how to use them. A good introductory course for the specialization track but useless as a unique course.,3
Good effort from Prof Stone in providing as much real-life relevance to the course.,3
"The course material could have been better....Instructor was just reading out content, more practical example and case studies could be a part of content.",3
"The course is really interesting, but it need a content review. Several - roughly 50% - of the links for external contents, especially when they are from newspapers, are broken.That considered, it was a fascinating journey.",3
"I liked it but I think it's a little too basic, even for me. Thanks you very much for this.",3
"The Teacher was great, but I was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week2.",3
"This course has very interesting programming examples and the exercises are really challenging. The philosophy of this course is to teach through example problems by explaining and solving them.The exercises are very well designed and reinforce the concepts very well. But, the later exercises might be a bit hard for an absolute beginner. Nevertheless, once you can successfully solve an exercise set, you can be sure that you have mastered the related concepts.By the way, this course uses many custom libraries which actually help in writing interesting programs to solve real life problems. The course resource page with detailed documentations is really helpful.Personally, I enjoyed the course. If you have some basic programming skills and want to solve interesting problems, you should give this course a try.",3
Nice course with troublesome assignments.,3
"Full of great information, but still a bit in ""beta"" stage. Just like the other courses in this specialization, it has more than a few kinks that still need to be worked out. I would be upset if I had paid for this, but I'm glad to learn about meteor in a free and structured way.",3
It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult.,3
"The information is really great, but the format was tedious and dull. Ws hard to really get interested in the information in the way that it was presented. Contrast this with the Happiness course for a clue as to how to make the information more interesting and compelling as far as presentation is concerned.",3
"I loved the non-UK / American basis for the writing and the study texts: fascinating reads and great eye openers to other styles and languages. Such a rich source! The videos and interviews were great and I loved the transcriptions - they made life so much easier to make notes and annotate from.The main issue I have is with the 'peer' marked work throughout the course. I feel this was meant to be a collaborative tool for us to use, but instead turned out to be a rather awkward device. Some students gave leeway to the 500 words limit; others not. I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context - took me 34 words over. How pedantic was that reader? Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief. Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English? Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English. All are different. How can I be fairly marked if the reader of my work has English as a second / third language? By that same token, can I really pass a student who has met the course criteria, yet has mis-spelled many words, has little or no punctuation and has jumbled tenses all over the place. This needs to be sorted out I feel, as it has marred this course for me. I don't feel it gave an even playing field to all. Thank you for the opportunity though, I did enjoy it!",3
Not so practical,3
"The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
"This course was a good introduction to the overall concepts. I am already working in the field so it was elementary to me, but I feel it has laid a good foundation for the specialization. I do not, however, feel it would hold much value as a stand alone course.I am not sure how you would achieve it given the asynchronous nature of the medium, but I would love more opportunities for feedback and discussion.",3
More practical exercises should be recommended.,3
"Very good course as a starting point. Although it still shall be better if there could be more detailed, academic study contents involved. And in addition, it might be both more inspiring and more attracting if the lecturer giving the information with more spoken presentation which approaching to a real class rather than a fixed script text.",3
"Great course, maybe with one more week they can cover another js data types or even jquery lib",3
"Compared with the regression course, this course was a slight disappointment. 1. there is less material compared to the regression course. Maybe this is because classification concepts are more intuitive. 2. the slides are much less prepared. Some of the sides even re-use earlier lesson slides in the beginning as a ""review"", much like soap operas re-use scenes from earlier episodes as ""memory recall"" to fill air time. 3. the math is more handwavy compared to the regression course. Neither course are supposed to go in depth with proofs, but I felt the regression course was at the right level and this course degraded too far. Do note it's very possible that I'm biased because I have seen more of the material from this course than the regression course.",3
"The course was more about CSR and philanthropy of businesses towards society which was not what I expected as the course topic as very vague. Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategies of various business and how their creation of value to stakeholders.The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on businesses role towards society at large.Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster",3
"It's very very basic, I know it's considered an introductory course but I expected more. It was very interesting and informative though.",3
"If you have some basic knowledge about food and nutrition, then this course is not the right for you. It's very basic and sometimes trivial. But the lecturer and course itself was really nice.",3
"Just three stars for the topic chosen Grainger, a bit to complicated and sometimes not strait-forwarded tasks.",3
"the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms. For example, the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market. Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year.( for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15%, then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year.",3
"Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great. I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3
"The content is very interesting and I learned a lot about Design Thinking. However, the lecturer sounds like she's reading the text, which sometimes makes it hard to focus on what she's saying.",3
I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,3
Heavy going! Informative though - and an engaging teacher.,3
"If you are not familiar with AI, you can learn its basic ideas in this course. However, 1. No moderators or teaching assistants answer questions in the discussion forum. 2. No slides are provided for preview and review. 3. The lecturer is very good, but the contents are basic. More state-of-the-art, practical materials would help a lot. 4. Some vides are too fast to follow.",3
"Very nice introduction in the private equity world, I like that the differences are explained between the anglosaxon an european systems",3
"This course has a very nice content. The difficult thing is to follow the classes with a very difficult language spoken by the teacher. Her English is not so good, although she has a good know-how about the subject but the classes are completely boring and apathetic. What a shame!",3
scarce material for weekly study,3
"Great course! but there was too little content!!!! Double it !! Or double the coursework! make us do more work! Also, tell people to use 'parfor' to speed up the computations.Otherwise, great course!",3
"Long, especially the week on Iran. Really proud of myself for getting through it.",3
"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling. This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",3
"I almost gave this two stars, but the content of the course is excellent, and I didn't want to take away from that. To start off, for an introductory class, this covers a large amount and variety of material. It might be better served to break it up into even smaller sections over the course of something like ten weeks or even twelve instead of cramming it all into seven weeks.The lectures are enjoyable, but often they consist of nothing but the professor speaking. There are so many new terms, definitions, and ideas being introduced that it would help if these lectures also included slides or graphs with some of these ideas being broken down, as you would have in a regular class on a projector or on a chalkboard.Frequently, the practice quizzes are just the same questions from the video lectures repeated over again, and offer very little prep for the actual quizzes, which are painfully pedantic for a non-credit course. Every section has a different style of quiz, which is hard to prepare for. I am someone who usually tests well and have been struggling with most of these, even when I read all of the handouts and take notes.So, if this same course could be broken up over a slightly longer time and the quizzes could be more uniform, the lectures contained some slides, the course would be a brilliant introduction to philosophy overall. It's got all of the meat there, the presentation just makes it tough to digest.",3
"I did learn the basics, but will need to go on and learn more in depth. I'd also like to have more written materials to go with the videos. I know I can download the video transcript, but what I'd like is actual handouts that are organized. I am more of a written/visual learner and need to read to retain information.",3
"Poorly described, but versatile in coverage. Could do with accessing Lecture Notes.",3
Teaches a lot of the basics but all the numbers are outdated (from 2013)there is minimal use of this being a video course.,3
"its not bad, but its not great either..the teacher's passion for music may overcloud his jugment..",3
"Content was good and questions were well-thought. Video lectures however would need written notes to accompany them. Also when videos are as long and fast-paced as it is in the course it would be nice to throw the major point in discussion on the background,this would help clarify and focus the idea the lecturer is trying to convey.",3
"Very interesting and applicable advices. But the theory too ""empirical"" and ""metaphoric"" for my taste, a little more rigor would not hurt!May 2016 - French student",3
"Content of the course is very good, useful and interesting, I greatly appreciate the knowledge delivered. But assignments could improve:-All module assignments seems mostly focalize on using Microstrategy tool. In assignments, i would like to see more exercises so that students learn through practice of business cases. For example, I prefer the way modules are organized in courses 1,2, and 3: concepts with examples, practice exercise, then assignment through similar exercise + a quiz.-In last assignment, there was no suggested solution(s) for the last question, i think this is missing for a good understanding.",3
Very good course. Interesting tips and summaries. Very helpful.,3
"Overall a good crash course and introduction to R. Its a lot to learn in 4 weeks and some of the assignments were challenging (which I liked). I think the course is worth taking but I do wish the material and assignments were packaged better - more aligned. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time online reading, researching, and learning some concepts on your own. Don't expect to learn everything from the lectures and materials to be successful in this course.",3
Not enough depth.,3
Not up-to the expectation. Course content was not of that much strength. Other parameter were pretty well and test question of week 3 were good.,3
Github exposition is a little complicated. I believe it could be more detailed. But the rest is very well done!,3
"I like the comparisons between past physical wars and current cyberwar. However, the course take the long way to explain very basic elements of nations interactions and trust.",3
"This course remind me so much of course done by Wesleyan University - Social Psychology, by great profssor Scott Plous.",3
Not so relevant with real work.,3
This is a pretty basic course. It teaches you three tools to organize your work and home to-do lists. I do not think I will use the system that was taught.,3
"An easy course, though I disliked the lack of Chinese characters (only pinyin - the transcription) and lack of grammar rules. I recommend it only for beginners who know nothing of Chinese.",3
It's very straightforward.,3
"Very basic information, focused strongly on test-taking strategies. Nothing bad here, but not really specifically adapted for lifelong learning. If you're a student and don't feel like you have effective, robust study strategies, check out this course as there are handy tips and tricks and some may be new to you.",3
This was my second course of six. It was so theoretical but at the final exam it required so much exercises. I propose enrich the course with exercises and hands on,3
"This is a cooked up version from an earlier, more extensive course. Lecture videos now split from 10-14 minutes into lots of 4-6 minute videos. It seems, some assignments are missing, too.",3
Good but needs more assistance with the students.,3
"The course is helpful for covering many aspects of project and product management, still it seems to be to basic which put in question whole specialization.",3
The tutoring quality are over the top teaching with well done mentoring and high quality materials. But I felt a lack of coverage of other graphic design of other cultures such as other countries where many ideas were born. ie: Africa and Asia.,3
"Has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem. The module does feel a little thin in content, and perhaps should be combined with Exploratory Analysis.",3
"Mr. Harris is great! A lot of course content could be as a prerequisite. For example, basic control structures of the python could been left out, just having a reference to material describing them. I hope following course will focus more on Raspberry Pi specifics.",3
thanks guys.,3
"I've been to college, so I'm not the target audience for this course, but I was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today. I felt the course covered mostly simplistic, obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder about.One topic that was covered was the different activities of professors. I wished I'd known more about this when I started college. Of course I knew they did research, but I thought they were primarily there to teach. This is true at some colleges, but at others, the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure. So teaching may not be the first priority for some professors. Students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professor's research interests, which could enrich or derail the course. This could have been covered in more depth.Other things that could have been covered: why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses; what a seminar is; the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors; how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take (wait lists, professorial overrides, etc.); when pre-requisite courses are really necessary and when they're just recommended; dropping courses; GRADES (how the college grading system works, what happens when you fail a course, academic probation, earning honors); campus codes of conduct (greater freedom as with class attendance; smoking and drinking rules, harassment policies) and disciplinary actions (disciplinary probation, expulsion); good campus activities for shy students.",3
The organization of the lessons sometimes feels out of place.,3
"There were some great lectures included in this course, but the emphasis on the content we were not receiving was a bit disheartening. I would have loved to view more of the controversial lectures that were referenced in the wrap-up.",3
"I enjoyed this course, but I was lost by the end. I understood the concepts presented in the videos (and got a high grade in the end), but the JavaScript needed for the last assignment was way over my head. I wish there had been more practice with actually using JavaScript; as it is I think I'll need to take another course or do independent study to learn what I should have learned to complete the last assignment.",3
Simple and clear explanations to solve problems.,3
"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.",3
Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document. Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure learners actually master the skills.,3
Content is interesting but the lectures and the content is far below the first course in the series in my opinion.,3
Just a basic introduction to computer science.,3
Still waiting for my assignment grades for weeks 1-3 despite having had many people mark these.,3
"I was expecting a bit more after the great first course of this specialization. Although I enjoyed week 2 and 3 (would give 5 stars), and walk away with relevant information that I can implement in my work, I found week 1 and week 4 difficult to get through. Long lectures, not always relevant stories, a presentation style that did not speak to me, and a bit slow. Nonetheless, I still learned some interesting concepts and I am looking forward to course 3.",3
"I don't like that the 3 and 4 star reviews are missing!Coursera seems to sometimes remove reviews with lower numbers of starts.I thought that this course was going to be mostly on the brain, but it wasn't at all.... just a small section.If your main interest is in vision then it might be different, but for me being interested only in how vision relates to the brain, there was very little useful information in this course for me.",3
"The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general. it is more broad than it is deep, and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested. While the content was helpful, this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript. Finally, some of the explanations and definitions, though interesting, weren't often well tied together. The final assignment case study was definitely useful in thinking about several of the metrics covered over the four weeks.",3
Presenter seemed a little unsure of what he was presenting by times,3
"The course was very informative in the areas it covered, Unfortunately it almost totally ignored the Israeli Arabs who make up about 20% of the population; perhaps it is normal to exclude them in Israel, but this is supposed to be an international course. With regard to the 'peace process', we were informed that one of the major problems with 'peace negotiations' between Israel and the Palestinians was the 1948 issue, yet Rabin was clearly murdered because it was thought he would return land occupied in 1967 - so your analysis doesn't quite add up. As right wing and religious extremism in Israel and amongst the settlers has clearly worsened since Rabin's death it would have been appropriate to explained how it is now possible with a two state solution, and how todays level of extremism is likely to affect Israel itself.",3
"I've got the chance to practice writing and I've learned some interesting insights, but I think the instructor didn't put too much effort into this course. All there is to it are 'shop talks' and too little structure.",3
"The course was of great help. It provides valuable insights to engage in academic research. However, I rate it only with three starts because I think it is too basic for the complexity involved in real research. Also I think some ideas provided in the course could be better organized. For example, in week three, the topic was understood to be something like ""Management Skills Applied to Research"" but the material pointed to something totally different. All ideas presented were great, but I think it is just matter to clarify better the objectives in each week.",3
"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 & 4 assignments.It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.",3
Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn't sufficient. Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes.This is the reason why Andrew Ng's Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging. Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful.I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session.,3
"I felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed. Those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the ""buffer"" built-in function (found in Chapter 3 of Dr. Chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the ""pass"" keyword, which I had to find in the Python reference manual for an explanation. The week 5 programs were quite advanced and I would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.",3
"In my opinion, it gets too technical and it is not a self contained course at all. Neither it is a beginner course for game theory. If someone is looking to understand the real basics of it, should take the Univeristy of Tokyo course. Some lessons were really abstract and I ended up looking for information in other websites to understand it. Another thing... I suppose the three lecturers are incredible good in their respective fields, but in the teaching part, Some Shoham's lessons were like listening to a robot. M. O Jackson is pretty clear in his explanations altough too technical, and Leyton Brown has a very clear way to teach, but I honestly got lost many times in the final exercises.",3
I would have like it if they could provide free graded assessment to non-certificate students; and make option for certification,3
Not much explanatory,3
it was a good course.but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring,3
I think the discussion on initiating and planning projects could be improved to be a bit more comprehensive and It would be great if the lecture slides were downloadable.,3
"The course is ok, the instruction was very poor for the deep learning section of the course.",3
"The content was inconsistently delivered and the topics disorganized. The content was excellent, although a bit repetitive at the end.",3
"Course was good, nice introduction to data science and its branches. There was not much of depth.",3
"It could be better if there were more working/practice examples, but it lays down a good overview of the techniques and decision making process.",3
"The course was alright in the sense that it was descriptive, however, the level of critical thinking suggested for the course was not actually indicative of the material presented.A lot of the material presented was great, but when the quiz came around, questions regarding the material were unequal. For example, in one quiz, there was a question about Galileo, but there was no mention of Galileo in the lecture for that week, and, a lot of the PDF'S were repetitive and not diverse in the material being taught.",3
Good basic overview. Not groundbreaking content or presentation compared to courses featuring Steve Blank or leaders from Google.,3
"The vast majority of reviews for this course are glowing. Well done!Coming from a non medical background I found this course very challenging. I hardly used any of the suggested readings or references as I found them too technical. I had to start at a more basic (high school) level and work my way up. After many hours of work, many failed first attempts and countless hours of eating comfort food, I eventually reached week 13. Did I feel ready for the final exams? I suppose it doesn't matter because I did pass and received my certificate.",3
"Some modules are better than others. There is a strong emphasis in accounting rather than modelling, which was not what I was looking for.",3
"Kind of basic about the writing stuff, i wish it work more about audience and characteristics of each age. Very useful the second part of the course, about editing.",3
Not much useful if you want to learn about IOT but helpful if you want to learn historical development that lead to IOT,3
Simple and fast.Try to put more difficulty on the quizzes.,3
You need basic understanding of Excel to follow the course. The formulas are interesting and,3
"This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: ""Ian Nicole"", ""Inacles"" and ""iNickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.",3
"Good overview for those without management experience. For experienced folks -- probably a good number since this is an Executive Data Science course -- it was pretty basic. Also some of the elements come down to management style. For some, other approaches have worked well and might not be ready to switch philosophies based on the course.Otherwise, pretty good.",3
This course is a refresher and provides a High Level overview of IoT and its historyas advertised,3
"Interesting topics, but not taught in the most interesting way. The professor answered in his lecture videos some of my basic questions about advertising, but I don't think that he made the class very exciting and I didn't feel motivated to seek out outside material. I'm glad I took this course, but I don't think that I would recommend it to many other people.",3
"Outdated presentation style: mostly ""voice behind text and Excel window"" long... long videos.I'm not questioning the material itself, but I was heavily bored during the course.",3
"The books, readings, and additional resources for studying are really good and helpfull. The only thing is that the videos where they explain the courses could be more fluid, dynamic and with a better domain of the tool by the professor.",3
"As a guy from Machine Learning field, its models and concepts are so easy and simple for me, so it's lack of challenge.",3
"It's look very very basics, i thought to get something more informative..",3
It was really frustrating that the autograder and assignment instructions didn't match. This course has been around too long for that big of a mistake. The lectures were the redeeming factor. They were interesting and presented the subject matter in a concise way.,3
The first half of the course was great but 2nd half was a bit disappointing.,3
more content is needed.,3
Too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language,3
"It can be made more informative on theory side. The course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course. But still i feel like things are going bit fast because I was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or R language. However, giving some efforts on both sides I am happy with my performance. Thanks for the course.",3
Interesting!,3
I was expecting this course to be more challenging than Functional Programming Principles in Scala but found this one easier in the end. The assignments were ok but I felt like they could have been more challenging and also that they should have tested my understanding of the course contents more thoroughly.,3
Clear instructions. Good for beginners!,3
I have not received yet my certificated and I can't see it in the list. Is there something wrong?,3
it is good lecture to learn SCM in other concepts,3
very nicely made course providing a good hands on with R language. Thanks!,3
"The second week, by Wietse Tol, is simply brilliant. I learned a lot about the etic and emic perspective on depression, and his insights about sociocultural factors are amazing. On the other hand, the last two weeks are boring and dull: they take the typical psychiatric bias and simply ignore any research compromising their orthodoxy (for example, Kirsch's studies). It would be interesting to include, as well, critiques to the concept of depression as well: there are transdiagnostic approaches expanding quite quickly, besides classical critiques of DSM categories. Overall, I would focus on the first three weeks and ignore the rest.",3
"The video instruction are not as helpful as I wished. They were too brief, and all the learning end up with doing the exercises. The regular exercises and the quizzes use different database system, and it sometimes hard to transfer what you learn to the quizzes.The pre-quiz exercises are more helpful imo, but no answer key is provided. Sometimes I am still confused even after passing the quiz.",3
A little too high-level for what I was looking for but a good introduction to get familiarized with some of the terminology and concepts.,3
"It's a good course by the standards of when it was made which, going by the overview, looks like 2014. the lectures are based on eclipse while the video teaches how to install android studio. Some of the examples are not compatible with Android studio and work only on eclipse. Being updated with the more recent material would've helped more. Having said that, the teaching style is really conducive to learning for newbies. It's a good introduction to the world of Android development.",3
"The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one. Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there. Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated.",3
A very quick overview of finance. Good review of fundamentals but not a lot of depth.,3
"Accurate , but very basic information.",3
The first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking. Good course that does what it is supposed to do. More feedback from test cases would be very helpful.,3
Very factual. Hard to grasp and follow.,3
it seems good and hopefully will be valuable in my context,3
"Loved the course, would take a continuation if available. Little basic but with enough info. Great ideas for cooking. Felt it was too based in USA information and some was not really conclusive.",3
Could be completed in a single day but spread across 4 weeks. I could understand a week but 4 seems silly.,3
"The scoring of the Peer Review, was not really measurable of your effort.",3
"I thought at times the explanations were a bit concise. If I look at the process mining course for example, a lot more video material is included (and its price is lower) with more concrete examples and practice. For non programmers it is not evident to find a solution to some of the assignments and there isn't much guidance on how to use certain tools. therefore, the time to be invested for non programmers - especially in week 3 - is far more than the hou",3
The course lacks coherence which comes as a big disappointment as it follows two excellent modules by Greg Northcraft.,3
Many points are just a presentation of bulletins with a very brief description. Could use a little more depth or at least some pointers for further study.,3
"A nice short course. I would have liked it to go a little more in depth. I don't think it provides more than a simple youtube-search could. However, the lecturer is very appealing and credible. Maybe there should be more in the ""suggested readings"" so people with the interest could add to their knowledge.",3
"Just good to catch the basics. Sometimes quite boring to follow the professor, but it covers the basics adequately.",3
It has great content.A good investment of your time.,3
"The emphasis on methods rather than specific tools makes the course more resistant to the continuous changes in technology. The stage is set well, and there are practical implementations. Still, it's disappointing to see that errors from previous rounds have not been corrected.",3
Maybe too easy.,3
This could be improved by adding more interesting subjects :- how to use list adapters with list view- how to use menus- how to use scrolling view- etc,3
"Not as inspiring as Developing Innovative Ideas, but yet a very informative Course. I only audited the course.",3
"Less is more. Not always, but it would be in this case. A lot of the lectures are unwatchable for me.",3
"Interesting concept and great insight into the workings of a research project, yet limited in scope, effectively the long term effects cannot be proven on evidence and the practical feasability of the ideal seems to be rather limited. I would love to eat more deer, though.",3
"Apparently, the instructor is well-informed in the history of the band.Nevertheless, information is delivered in a huge portions, sometimes cluttered and it s easy to lost in the narrative.Sound quality is bad (the volume is jumping sometimes and there is a lot of noise)May I suggest that you provide a short arts of songs you are talking about?I understand, there are copyright issues, but still, something should be done about it.All in all, I wish to enroll in the second, improved release of this course",3
Great overall material.I think work needs to be done in order to improve the presentation of new concepts and vocabulary as well as the English of the speaker (and the corresponding caption).,3
Excellent Courst but you have to pay in order to access the quizes and assignments... very dissapointing.,3
LOVED but wish it would have been more in depth and less of an overview of other services,3
Good course. Stands well in the specialization. It was a bit buggy throughout tho. And the assignments could have focussed more on the control part.,3
Useful. However this course was very complicated and had way too much math for my taste.,3
"learning graph with Java while reviewing varieties of java advanced data structure. in a word, help me a lot.",3
the homework is getting easy,3
"I was not too fond of some of the comments/thoughts presented (ie. test gods, lady luck, that zombie talk, and the discreet mention of evolution as THE fact - referencing to Charles Darwin as some great intellect). To me that was drawing the idea that the Almighty Creator does not exist. But that is silly, given that only now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function - when He had that all figured out and established from the beginning. My point is, give credit where it's due. T",3
"It's OK, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation. As with a few coursera courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained. Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit.",3
Can't get score for free!!!,3
"I FIND THE MATERIAL REALLY GOOD AND EASY TO FOLLOW, THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH CHAPTER. I LIKE THAT THERE IS INTERACTION BETWEEN PEERS AND HOW THERE IS FEED BACK FROM EACH OTHER, BUT I DONT LIKE THAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN OPINION, IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IF I GET FEEDBACK FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AS LITTLE AS ME OR IS BEGINNING TO EXPLORE GRAPHIC DESIGN, I WOULD HAVE LIKED AN OPINION FROM A PROFESIONAL OR A TEACHER WITH MORE EXPERIENCE. ALSO, AFTER FEEDBACK THERE SHOULD BE A CORRECTION ASSIGNMENT OR A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE YOUR PROJECT BETTER.",3
"Though the course itself is introductory in nature, i wish there was a lecture on what and how exactly are these going to be useful with the help of a real life example and also an increase in the depth of the content.",3
The connection between lectures and assignments needs to be improved.,3
The old version was more interesting.,3
Decent overview but could have spend more time showing plotting techniques in more detail than showing what makes an appealing plot. Also The section on the back-end of MatPlotLib was more detailed than it needed to be for quick overview but not detailed enough to be very useful.,3
"The material is very interesting, but the course goes very fast, and the presentation is dry.",3
"I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what's going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept.The real reason I'm rating it 3/5, though, is that the mathematical notation is all over the place. You will find a matrix product such as A*B' only to go on and implement A'*B. This is SO confusing.I would still recommend this course, but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors.",3
"The course is a good overall approach to Human-Computer Interaction. It teaches how to do participan observation, interviewing, storyboarding and heuristic evaluation.However, I would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignments.In general I found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities, for design in general.",3
"The course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statistics/maths background. The swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course, but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect. Personally, I have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lectures.For the course project, there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria. As a basic statistic course, the correctness of the estimation/ calculation/ assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect. Hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course.",3
This give a very good insight into what i did not know earlier. Thank you Prof. Anders Holm. I recommend this course to all all. I did a lot of learning. Go for it,3
This course has help me a lot,3
"This Course is very standard. I would have given 5 stars. Once you complete the weekly quiz and PASS it, you don't see the worked out solutions for the weekly quiz so that you can review.",3
"the course is relatively short for providing sufficient technology and knowledge to master a new project. It does give an overall concept of project management procedures and skills. Anyway, it is not as valuable as I expected from the beginning. The professor himself is of deep knowledge and proficient experience. I have experienced several projects and find this course not that well match my expectation.",3
"I am new to statistics and found most of the lessons difficult to understand, although I did pass the course and had taken the first two courses of the specialization before. More exercises would help. Also I do not plan on using R in the future so this part of the course was not very relevant to me, but it was not the hardest.",3
"Videos are easy to understand and follow, but there's sometimes to little background knowledge about writing good apps, security and good practices. The communication with the server and what would look like the final working product is not explained at all.",3
"Not for beginners in the slightest. Enjoyed the videos. But the quiz just made me feel stupid as I didn't have a clue on any of the equations and simulators I was supposed to use. It got me thinking of how ignorant clever people continue to be! Every time a smart person comes up with a new theory it's taken as fact. Give it a couple of decades and someone will prove it wrong. The sun orbiting us proving wrong, easth is flat, gas giants only orbit outside the habitable zone etc etc etc. So when will we learn that just because something happens on this planet doesn't mean it will, has happened elsewhere. The deepest depths of the ocean have life forms, yet we'd perish. So who's to say life forms can't exact on a planet, moon that is nothing like the earth! The world is still at the centre of the universe to these academics!",3
"Information needs be updated especially with the changes just made in France 2015. It was a little slow and quizzes were often frustrating due to questions and answers not matching up, or info was not given in the lecture. Overall, since it was 101 and basic, I enjoyed learning the new information.",3
"A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started.",3
"Many useful techniques and perspectives in this course!Take this course if: you are looking to learn new techniques to improve your time-efficiency and performance in learningDon't take this course if: you are put off by pseudoscientific assertions (an explanation based on the insula being the ""fear center of the brain"" comes to mind) or interspersion of useful information by neurobiological theories that have no relevance for improving your learning performance",3
The only reason that I am giving 3 star is the design of the quizzes for each week. The readings are too long and the content of the quiz sometimes gets you frustrated!,3
Too much focusing on history of telephony and only little focus on IoT.,3
"I think that this course has wonderful material, however, I think that more than 2 people should be required to peer review the assignments so it is a balanced grade. In my other classes, at least 5 reviewers are required to review each individual assignment.",3
"This course as much content in it and it's difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together. Some videos are taught having the same problem like, for example, some tools/themes are presented without us knowing what they are for. E.g., Chi-squared test and null hypothesis. Only after a while we understand their use. This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week. The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) ""I did the website"", which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) we're no evaluating the participant performance but the website. Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind. Now, when we do the peer review we realize that you're expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having ""early prototype"" and ""user feedback"". The original problems just seem not to count. Only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading.",3
No enthusiasm to hold attention but good content,3
Good introduction,3
"It was nice experience, but to be hones I expected more information about this topic and that is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",3
This course definitely enhanced my marketing knowledge but I recommend it be updated. Assignments such as Red Laser should be updated considering the app has been shut down.,3
"The video lectures are informative and interesting, but the QUIZZES COVER INFORMATION NOT ADDRESSED IN THE LECTURES!!",3
"Generally good, but exercises in Week 3 & 4 have not been proofread and are full of mistakes. Too bad.",3
"I would have liked this course to be longer, so that the information could have been spread out among more lectures, rather than so much information condensed into one week. It made the exams a little confusing.",3
"The course is ok, it touches on some interesting topics and it serves its purpose as an introductory course. Unfortunately more interesting topics are only briefly mentioned at the end of the last video. I also think the assignments can be improved, some assignments lack documentation, one of them had a coordinate system swapped from what was shown on screen and the evaluation of some assignments are quite tight, even if you have it working, unless you deliver exactly as it is expected you will fail, not to mention what is expected is sometimes blurry.",3
Difficult. I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people.,3
Full Individuals speaking,3
"A five-week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans. The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system, differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music, biological interpretation of scales, and the impact of cultural differences onto music.The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education. Its real subject is certain topics in biology, not music. Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student, and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow.",3
"The only setback I had was during the purchase of the course. My amount has been deducted from the bank, but no intimation from this is obtained, neither from Coursera nor Paytm. Please DON'T RUIN YOUR IMAGE because of this. Except for that , This is an excellent course material. Loved going through the videos and assignments. Was equally challenging and FUN to learn RORThanks :)PS : Please initiate the Re-Payment process or at least reply to student's grievances in the Help and Support Forum.",3
Good start to the course. Though I feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course. Some content is not prevalent at present (outdated).,3
could have lecture more.... the videos talks little about the spreadsheet provided,3
Interesting but not much practice despite the title.,3
"good course, but... paid, I can't submit the task",3
"Nice overview of the specialization. Since it aims at showing the advanced and interesting things you will learn during the specialization, some of the practical sessions are way too advanced. Thus, for me felt more like a mechanical copying of what the instructors did rather than an actual assessment of what I understood. Also, since some of the applications are actually repeated at the beginning of the main courses, it feels like a repetition somehow when then you move to the specialized courses.",3
"If you are looking a general HTML Course, this is for you. This provide general knowledge to create simple web pages, some basic HTML tags and a few practices. My expectation was to have a deeper knowledge of HTML5, spend more time reviewing difference between HTML5 version and the last ones but, I didn't get it, this why I'm giving just 3 starts",3
Would have rated it 4 if i had received my certificate of accomplishment like i was told at the starting of the course. The course was very informative and explained thoroughly and all but when you put it down on your resume or something its good to have a document backing up the claim.,3
"I like the course and the material; I would suggest to include quiz, to the end of each section.As well, it will be easier to write a story from final task after each section, not at the very end",3
"At first the questions were wrong, but i contacted with the professor and he corrected them.",3
Not so good. The course explains mathematical models and Excel applications but both are not detailed. There are many mistakes in PPTs and assignments.,3
"Far less staid than some of the more traditional academic teaching formats in this science field. I was surprised I actually anaged to get through the introductory module but by the end of the course I was less inclined to want to attempt the end of module project simply because the instructions did not really provided sufficient indicators that guided newcomers to the subject of programming but in this science field it seems that is the norm with many introductory programming courses.Maybe the people teaching have forgotten what its like to start at the beginning and recall a time when they thought surely there is a better way in which to teach this subject that makes the connection between theory and practice and the relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links a more plausible and achievable option for those unfamiliar in the field of computer science. Not sure why this aspect seems to fall short in CS but for some reason it does.I should imagine this course for many people who are either familiar with the fundamentals of programming and/or aufait with CS concepts on the whole and have already acquired the necessary basic skill set / knowledge base of programming, will find the subject and teachings rather informative and a move forward in the development of programming languages as the format in writing programs does depict a much simpler approach when compared to other languages.Sadly, for a complete beginner to CS this, in my opinion, fails to sufficiently guide or assist newcomers in building the confidence to later embark on a project that draws on the subject topics taught thus far and to that end its a bit of a shame as it tends to dampen your enthusiasm if you are interested in the field of computer science as that lack of clarification on what aspects relate to what factors does not become clear so when faced with the daunting task of the end of module project you may find yourself non-plussed wondering which topic relates to which task in the final project?I am sure other people will be inclined to disagree with my opinion on this but this is, after all, just my opinion, after giving the subject taster a try, the end result for me, was that the teaching methods were good as they appeared more relaxed and format was offered in a far more enjoyable way of teaching/learning a subject that, I felt, attempted to invoke or entice people where an interest in CS had been sparked and was perhaps aiming to offer a route in which to build the foundations of a programming language but then by the final week it was a case of well we have thrown this information your way, its now up to you to decipher what you need to apply to the which part of the final project and is done so under the guise of problem solving.The latter being a plausible concept I would find perhaps more applicable later on in the specialisation as you develop knowledge/skills. But to be incorporated into the very first module of this pathway it seems doing so is, what it seems like most introductory programming courses invoke, and, is quite a leap to embark upon especially without first being offered stepping stones sufficient enough to feel certain you have adequate understanding to be able to sift through the information provided and subsequently decide upon which aspects are relevant in order to attempt to accomplish the tasks set that ultimately form to complete the final project.Its actually through being guided by the experts whose teachings highlight to newcomers through practical visual sessions where we actually begin to learn where these interconnections link between these chunks of informational topics - all of which form the essential fundamental building blocks - and in so doing, that perhaps perceived initial 'spoon fed' approach then enables a newcomer to build sufficient skills and knowledge to then be able to actually 'develop' their confidence. Without the essential basic foundational mixture how is it possible to engage newcomers enough for them to determine when they will then feel equipped to attempt a final project? This stepping stone approach is surely the most effective way to equip a person new to a subject field so they can then broaden their knowledge base. Alas, in CS it seems the falling flat on your face so to speak is a preferential approach to learning in this field of study.Its such a shame these highly intellectual people who create these courses forget what its like to start at the very beginning and the time it takes and guidance needed in order for a person to be able to feel like they are ready to dive in and give a topic like this a whirl. Like I said, its only my opinion but this is where the interconnection and building of the knowledge base falls short at an early stage of development.",3
It misses an assignment which will allow to practice the clustering skills.,3
"To be honest, I couldn't realize why this had to be an entire seminar on its own. Apart from that, in some videos the audio quality was rather poor and the instructor seemed to have caught some cold or something. Although the topic of the course is interesting and significant, I think that do far it is the least engaging of the specialization...",3
"hands on experience based content would have been appreciated, Its a good course.",3
"I thought that they could have gone more in depth in terms of metrics, how to calculate them, and use them in real life situations. The course seemed to focus too much on the type of companies that use data, as well as what type of jobs there are in this field. I didn't find it too relevant or helpful in terms of making me more productive at work.",3
"it is okay, not what I expected, but okay.",3
This course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about Understanding Clinical Research - as title anotate,3
The course is very interesting. The Jupiter notebook is very useful.I don't like that many examples are very US-specific. Some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside USA.Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. Often it's not clear the requirement of the task. It takes very long to understand. Also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.,3
"The course gives you interesting analysis tools, but the title suggests you are going to learn new Excel tools, and you actually use it at a very low level.",3
This is basic content i wish it was a more outside just a lecture style where the lecturer just reads from the slides.,3
"The three stars are because the parts actually giving information had value and I learned some interesting things. The 2 stars were removed because of the truly obnoxious plugging of the prof's own book and research project. He goes on and on about how fantastic it is how we can all participate in scientific research, but if I am SUPPLYING DATA, why do I have to pay for that privilege!? If it were really about the research he would want my data whether I paid for it or not. The course felt mostly like one big plug to make money. To make this course worthwhile you have fast forward a lot through the sales raps, which includes a few lectures in their entirety. It's also much better at twice speed, but most classes are. :)",3
Too easy,3
Good and clear content. A bit from an American point of view... I missed some in depth explanation (like the class of the nerv-system or the Glycemic index). Overall easy to watch and good lessons.,3
"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.,3
too simple(,3
Some presentations are too kitch.,3
"Assignments don't always align to the course content....In terms of usefulness and coverage of this course, this really is just the basics of R.",3
"The course experience was a little bit weird. It's too easy for a dedicated programmer or IT person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming. (And maybe Python programming, too.) The main problem is too small community. I wrote some, but never got any answer. I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture.",3
"Very basic content, not that helpful - states what to pay attention to, but scarcely ""how to"". Also is very static, uses very little illustrations / animations / visuals, which is a shame for a photography course...",3
It's satisfactory but I recommend reading the book.,3
It was alright ..confusing at times an seemed a bit convoluted. someone needs to come up with a better way to explain these concepts so that they are not so jumbled.,3
"The concepts are explained very well. The only issue was the Programming assignment, which could have been more descriptive. Also, they could've given us the option of choosing a programming language.",3
Great content but animations are annoying!,3
"While the textbook used in this course provide a lot of useful background to the Internet, it's history and trends...etc All good knowledge. I am not sure it's the best teaching tool for this course. It lacks the structure to build up a solid foundation of HTML. If the course stops here, the text may be a good reference for students to explore on their own. With CSS and javascript later in the series, I felt a stronger (both in depth and coverage) HTML proficiency is needed.",3
Very simple overview of the UX process.,3
The instruction is vague and boring.,3
There were some technical challenges that made this course not as fun. The content was good. If you make the assignments easier to submit (for example: provide a box to write a statement as opposed to uploading one) it will remove frustration and increase enjoyment.,3
An interesting class that traces the origins of Buddhist meditation and the Western usage today. A nice dovetailing of research topics covered to attempt to link measurable changes due to meditation practices while trying to maintain a good control group; not easy.,3
Material was interesting. Did not enjoy the teaching method of Prof. Caffo. Very scripted and skips way too fast through some of the equations and R code he's trying to teach.,3
"I don't like the fact you have to pay 80 dollars just to unlock assignment submissions. The fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the 80 dollars. Think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was 10$. Otherwise, the class so far is useful.",3
"A little too basic, but still good.",3
"Doug's lectures were great! He's entertaining and he gets the concepts across very clearly. I struggled with the course itself, however. The participation rate was low and the iOS app was so buggy I deleted it. The web interface was better but still difficult to work with.The iOS app would forget I was in the course and lose my assignments. It also wouldn't let me open the discussion forums. With the technical problems and low participation I can only give the course 3/5.",3
It's too diffult for some of the questions in the Quiz. Have no idea or support to solve them.,3
nice but doesnt give you much knowledge,3
Too easy for me,3
"This course takes an alternate approach to understanding modern Art, moving it away from categories based on the time period in which art was made or what school the artist was part of and instead groups art work by theme. I really enjoyed all the pieces I encountered and felt like I had a somewhat better understanding of modern art after taking this course.",3
It's a good course. It is very simple. It's just exposition and quizzes. Great for beginners.,3
It can be more exhaustive..,3
make it more interective,3
Need to me more technical. It was covering very basic concepts,3
"Not very motivational but nice,",3
"I didn´t like this course so much. Great part of the content is about mediation, arbitration and negotiations that are not sucessfully. I thought I´d see more about improving practices to negotiate and convince the other part in a negotiation.",3
"The content for teaching how to create website is nothing. The name should change to how to create a website with Wordpress. I found some videos on the internet help more than this course. However, some links and information are very useful.",3
Another good and interesting course but the total lack of engagement by the course team and community mentors makes it hard going.,3
"This course could work better as either a longer course with more examples, exercises, and step by step instructions in excel, or as a smaller part of the first and third courses in the specialization. The content is good and the examples are properly explained, but it probably doesn't warrant an entire course of its own",3
assignment is a little bit messy.,3
The way of presenting topics of philosophy is refreshing and inviting for further reflection. The tests however are focusing on nitty gritty differences or features in the presented videos. Less motivating to submit the tests and invites me to focus only on the preseed video and excellent links to other extra sources.,3
"the set up for the course was choppy, with random intervals of questions. could definitely flow better",3
"Too short, too expensive.",3
"I cannot sign up for the message board -- why can't we just use Coursera's built-in one like other classes do? Also, it would be a lot nicer if we didn't have to pay to even submit quizzes to get any feedback. I feel like I should only have to pay to get the certificate or maybe a final project review. Also, I don't really think all the intro to programming stuff should be in this class. It seems like it should be a separate class, really, like explaining what a function is. Objective C is big enough on its own without trying to teach C, too. The assignments aren't very inspiring, either, although I like how simple the first one was because it got me on my computer trying to do it the first day.",3
"I thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process. Maybe I missed something, but it fell a little short of the mark for me.",3
The course is good but it's stupid to make course only in chinese language.,3
"Good lecture and educational.Extremely bad thing that is not offered and for free.same bad is that they are not try to explain more, (for students with less tech skills).In any case i am happy with the course and i will continue with the specialization, but regardless my decision to continue, my very fair rate will stay low, (especially for the fact that they didn't offer the course and for free).",3
"Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.",3
This is a good course. A thorough introduction to ruby on rails.,3
This course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts. I found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting. I never knew that what I learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems. Some videos were a bit long though.,3
"While I think the teacher is an expert on the matter, this course what somewhat less structured and clear as the other courses in the specialisation. The teacher covered a range of topics, but didn't provide clear frameworks or structures for how to deal with different issues. I've done the three prior courses of SEO in the series and they were extremely clear and have a lot of valuable tools and frameworks to work with. I would also have appreciated some discussion again about metrics in this course - specifically related to content marketing.",3
In spite of this course being very basic it give you a quick highlight on the fundamentals of management principles.,3
The course was not that clear should have taught more in detail thank you,3
"I found it to be a very basic course, instead of being offered as a separate course this could actually be covered in one module as part of the advanced level. Also, some of the case studies are outdated as i could see the course was developed in 2014. given that its a digital marketing related course, it becomes all the more important to have more recent and relevant case studies for this course.",3
Good introduction to very basic stuff. I skipped many videos and found the same information on the internet. If it wasn't part of the specialization I wouldn't pick it.,3
"Interesting and useful to a degree, but I was looking for something a little more challenging. In addition, the quizzes were far too easy.",3
"The course does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures. And it does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization.The lectures and starter code could use some better integration.The assignments could be improved. They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it. This is kinda the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.This course has been taught many times, and the forums contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken.My main objective for this course was to continue learning Java, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars.",3
"My opinion:Not much monitoring of the forums by mentors\instructors, hence responses are non- existent\delayed\misleading. some of the replies by mentors were misleading, The rationale of the Volt-sec balance was not set out very clearly, The expression evaluator is very temperamental, i had to enter the expressions many times , a very time-consuming & frustrating process.",3
"The course had too much stuff crunched (and poorly explained) in too short a time period. That said, I got something out of it using a self-directed approach.",3
"Good Slides, I learned a lot of IoT and AR, specially IoT.Unfortunately, the Professor only reads the slides. I was expecting more from Yonsei University",3
mechanically it worked pretty well. just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important. what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood . . .,3
There wasn't much to learn that I didn't already know. There was a lot of talk but no real practical application (I guess except for github for people that didn't know how to use that).,3
"For an introductory course it is ok, however can't help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through. In an effort to structure each session in the same way, detail has been missed out. Practical examples and hands-on exercises are very inadequate. Not impressed.",3
"I don't really like the format. I want lectures from the instructor, not animation and slides.",3
"A bit boring, but still informative.",3
it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine,3
Its good information but not quite what I was looking for in terms of actionable steps that I could take to engage with stakeholders from different countries!,3
It is not worth 30$,3
A good refresher but did not get to know anything new.,3
"It felt few content, i think there could be more content in this course. Though i have to say i learn new stuff, but i which it had more content to learn more.",3
I learned many thing in this course. It will be knowledgeable for all the web base students.,3
Good introduction to ASD.,3
"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning.",3
I felt that topics were not treated in enough depth. It was a lot of topics to cover in a 4-week course.I learned a lot from the kaggle competition.,3
"Expecting more hands on experience with big data frameworks like Hadoop or Spark. Instructions of the final assignment is very confusing, you don't actually know what it really want you to do until you go through all the Q&As in the discussion forum, which is really wasting time.",3
"It wasn't easy to understand the practices of software development in this course. Please try to explain a little close, how software devs actually work.",3
Great course materials.Found it difficult to form groups of students and meet up for the activity cases.,3
"it's a basic course very focused on the mainstream music industry, it is very concise and worth reviewing, unfortunately you can not get feedback from the exams if you don't pay.",3
"Don't get me wrong, this is a good course, the teacher obviously knows his stuff and delivers the information in a good way. It gives you what you need to know. But I expected more. A wider grasp on things, additional readings, quiz’s, related articles, links and so on. Maybe not mandatory but in addition to what already is there.",3
"The course is good, but some gaps of information in the middle of the course. It could be better organized",3
"It would probably make more sense if it was titled ""Project Management Capstone Project"" or ""Project Management Capstone"" or similar. Other than that, no complaints, a single peer assessed project to put into practice what you have learned in the other modules of the specialisation.",3
"It is too simplified to get a real view of the 90's economic situation , especially the 91-93 years.To talk about transition between A and C , better to talk about A and not only about B and C.It is an useful course for general knowledge of Russia , it as a start , for more accurate analyses I could advise this ( in russian) :https://openuni.io/course/2/and thathttps://openuni.io/course/3/",3
"This seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but haven't given it much thought. I also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices, as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments. Some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well, but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like I didn't gain much new information.",3
It's clear and offers a very good foundation. Supplementary material is helpful. However in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised (or not) today by modern-day companies. Some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to.,3
Really nice but a little complex for people who just want to learn the basics. This would be very helpful for current college students as the course includes optional readings that are very informative and helpful for a deeper understanding.,3
"Good course about NoSQL MongoDB. I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs. He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided. I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.",3
"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials.",3
"As an introductory course, the content was good. But I wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on. Rather than history of Recommender systems & what happened in the 90s, I would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field, the latest mathematical techniques etc.",3
breaking down the videos into various little ones would be more productive i think.,3
"It's more or less a repetition of what you've learned in all the courses, tying four peer-reviewed assignments together into a somewhat contrived ""project"". Not bad, but doesn't really add much value to the courses before.",3
Lots of theory but includes some useful models and formulas,3
Above the average score,3
A good overview of the landscape of of IOT.,3
Audio on videos was sometimes unclear. Course content was interesting.,3
Excepting some coding on Big Data.,3
Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused!,3
"The course is good. Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback. I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run.",3
"Did not like the peer-graded dynamic, and also the lectures were pretty basic, I felt that it lacked depths in some subjects.",3
"good stuff, but a bit preachy",3
"I liked pretty this course. I learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation. As a negative point, I found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better.",3
"Interesting concepts. The instructor is knowledgeable. As an organizational development practitioners, I found it very academic relative to the terms used and examples given. In some cases, I had to translate the terms used to every day layman language to really understand the concepts as they would apply in my day-to-day work.",3
"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars. As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete. This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",3
"Three stars for course structure, two stars less for every poor course material which doesn't contain any guidance to test questions.",3
"Interesting course and worth doing. Could be completed in a day or two if you're just viewing the videos and answering the quiz.Positives: The content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about, and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide to.Negatives: First week doesn't add much. The videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrived.Overall, a good primer before moving onto other courses, as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable.",3
"It was well presented but a little light on, I was hoping for a bit more ""meat"" to it. But interesting none the less, & a fascinating insight into how few people apparently cook their own food.",3
"The first course in this series was really good and this one was so-so at best. I got some skills out of it since I obsessively plotted everything and over did the assignments, but the peer grading rubrics are crap. It's all or nothing so if you submit *anything*, you get a grade (and it usually approaches 100%) but I didn't really get much helpful/thoughtful feedback on anything I did since you literally get ZERO feedback from the instructors (nothing!) nor did I get much in the way of helpful info from the people who peer reviewed my work. I find that pretty disappointing really.",3
Just taking part of the course material was rewarding. A good basic introduction to Organization Design. Looking forward to the next step in Designing the Organization,3
clear and good example but limited contents,3
The enthusiasm of the instructors was the best thing about this class. But I really wanted a more rigorous methodology - and didn't really get it here. But it was an alright introduction to machine learning but not enough if you want to know what makes the 'black box' work.,3
Not many new concepts. Mostly common sense.,3
"Feels like there is an extreme disconnect from the tutorials/lectures and the programming assignments. The programming assignments, were at times, rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week. Overall I feel like I have a decent base in R, however I still feel like a lot of concepts were lost/not explained thoroughly enough.",3
"knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based",3
"I have mixed feelings. It was WAY too easy for me, but my wife did it too and it was about right in difficulty for her. But either way, I felt like it just taught you to install stuff rather than actually teaching meaningful material.",3
We surely all know that the human power is vital to the develop of any given organization. And an effective talent pipeline would help a lot. But there's not enough practical advices about how in this course.,3
The course is very informative for those interested in data analytic and want to go for market research kind of jobs.,3
A very useful course for budding professionals. Wouldn't recommend this to middle managers / data experts.,3
"Course give very good information, but the ""The addicted brain"" its not the correct name.Second part of the course give more detail information about different drugs and body biology, but its not directly related to the Brain.However, the training its very good, just change the label.",3
I believe this introductory course would be better if it stresses more on the Agile Manifesto Part,3
Not so much hands-on work in this course.Give us more homework please! ;-),3
"It is pretty an interesting course, especially the practical tasks, but, after all, it is much better for those who already knows the technologies mentioned in the title. The information is given very quickly during the lectures, so it may be not so useful for web development beginners (even regarding possible background in other areas of software development). That is why I recommend that course for those who is looking for a good HTML, CSS, and JS revision, not introduction.",3
"The content is quite interesting ,but the professor was lacking luster .",3
"Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel. However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade. You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.",3
"Material is relevant. Most of the assignments require student guesswork, writing functions not covered in the lecture.",3
"Good course about getting the basics for the Data Science specialization, but a bit overpriced, as the content is low, and can easily be done in 4-5 hours.",3
A bit american - but I like it!,3
The questions asked in the tests could have been better. Design questions based on application rather than memory.,3
"This course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail. I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course.",3
It is ok but very small,3
"It would be better if it was more interactive. The videos aren't very helpful for a beginner programmer, and the assignments are pretty challenging. I still feel like I learned something though, but mostly from swirl which is a pretty cool thing!",3
pretty good but expected more of helping writing own programs,3
The material covered is more complex than the previous courses yet there is much less explanation given. It's still perfectly doable but one ends up feeling like you are missing something.,3
"I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done. The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.",3
"The videos are quite interesting, though I think they are overly committed to very specific techniques. I did not, however, find the assignments and peer review system very helpful. People had a tendency, particularly on the first assignment, to read in requirements that were not actually stated or written down and failed people accordingly. There also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments, either--perhaps due to the paywall for assignments. The very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review. This exacerbates the very harsh ""0 or 1"" point option for all assignments (i.e. either you get a 1 and pass or you get a 0 and fail).Bottom line: I think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers, but I'm not sure it's worth the $79 entry fee to gain access to the peer review, unless you really need or want the course certificate.",3
"It is ok, and not as good as the marketing class from warton",3
"The course is perfect, however, since I am a person who prefers more concise information and pragmatic skills, the teaching examples with analyses might seem lengthy and not so efficient for me.",3
"The course is interesting and entertaining at times, though seems relatively undercooked. Typos in video lectures and assignment writeups are still frequent. The course content is a bit rushed, with some rather difficult aspects left almost unexplained. Definitely not for begginers, as some knowledge of physics, differential equations, calculus, matlab programming is highly recommended!",3
That was very informative and motivating course. I wish the quiz was not that detail oriented and hard..,3
very eye opening. videos were very clear and the explanations were clear,3
Simple and accessible introduction to Machine Learning for people without strong Maths and IT background. Can become quite slow and boring (almost irritating) if you come from an engineering or technical background (some videos could have been summarised in half of the time).,3
"The games needs to be explained in sufficient details. In addition, after a point in time, it became too technical.",3
"Far too basic in content. It's clearly aimed at people with next to no experience at all on writing and publishing! However, it still is insightful and inspirational as, 'Writing for Young Readers' is taught by two established children writers and, packed with interviews of other writers from all around the world. A nice introduction but, just that -an introduction. If you have experience writing (for children or else)",3
"Very basic course. If you know about data science, data analysis, or machine learning, you may find this class basic or boring. Good intro course for those who have no prior knowledge",3
The audio quality of the lectures could be better. Assignments need to be challenging. Programming assignments in Assembly should be used to evaluate the grade in addition to quizzes.,3
"Quiet good introduction with clear objectives.Some step by step explanations could be shortened because they seem too detailed.A brief introduction to creating your own data could be great and will cover more stepsBy hte way, thanks for this good introduction",3
So easy~But the teacher is well！,3
"This is a good course, and you get an overview of a lot of interesting topics. However, as you advance further in the course, some of the math begins to lose consistency, while some of it just gets skipped.",3
It was a good basic intro into the statistical methods of epidemiology. Quite basic.,3
Good course.,3
"Lots of good parts to the course. Found the ODE examples very useful. Feel like it tailed off at the end in terms of detail and utility. Also, it seemed less adapted to the format than other courses such as Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and Computational Neuroscience by Rajesh Rao.",3
"Good for what it is: a rock-bottom basic introduction. I would have appreciated more technical instruction in how to create complex, involved visualizations and less philosophizing and design ethos. A better name might have been ""What is Data Visualization? A Course In Tableau For Non-Professionals"" or something like that.",3
"The Course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved. Despite the low quality of the quizzes, the course is very inspiring. The examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the Mathematics involved, which was refreshing.",3
"The course and the content was great, but the grading process was terrible. Will probably finish the specialization, but wish there was a better way to be graded for the money.",3
Instruction was through watching other characters designers talk about their process.,3
The course is different from expected. It is more Software Project Management than Software Product Management.,3
"This is a very basic course. The contents do not cover a whole lot of ground. I personally did feel that there is a lot of repetition and this course did not help much . I somehow feel this course and the next ( the practical one ) could have been combined into one. Otherwise, not worth 2 courses of money.",3
I don't like to tie quiz to the paid course,3
"Good course, teaches how are actually big dairy enterprises, in a country with unlimited resources, it`s not usefull in develeping countries, and doesn`t teach how to understand the way to start a business and the differences in small, medium, big and gigantic business in diary production. Aren`t there any small diary farm en USA ? It`s not feaseble to start a small diary business in USA? How different in costs and profit are diary in different countries?, How USA government helps diary business in USA? Thanks for your teaching and Sharing your experiences.",3
"Good information and assignment design, but please just have someone on your team go through this. I could list the issues with your lectures, but they're so easy to detect by anyone who is watching them actively. It makes me think that QC isn't a part of your workflow, and worry about the quality of future courses in this specialization.",3
Could have made it more interesting,3
"Hi Team,Course is good.Videos and contents need to be updated on regular basis, sometimes data discussed is bit outdated.",3
"The first round of the capstone was separated in time by about 6 months from the initial courses, so the lack of additional material was rough. Otherwise the process was a good real word application of NGS processing.",3
it gives you the necessary tools and knowledge for just beginning the data mining course. so you cannot expect to learn about the process itself.,3
Not deeply explained not for beginneer.,3
good course. Can be better in terms of information and assignments.,3
I was hoping to learn more stuff I didn't already know. This class is more of just a vague overview of the other courses. Can be completed in 1 week.,3
"A bit odd this one. It hase some points, but most of the training is looking on what the other courses are.. Like paying for commercial :-)",3
The course has a good content. I wish there was an active participation by the mentors on the discussion forum.,3
"I felt that the programming assignments were not explained well enough, things like different syntax that wasn't explained and such. If the class required a lot of outside research not included in the class, they should mention that more clearly.",3
"This one starts out pretty slow, in fact I had a hard time getting myself excited about working through the material unlike the ML specialization. However, it does get better at the end. Not sure I'm sold on this specialization yet, but we will see after the next course. I think overall from Coursera I'd like to see more interaction and graded programming exercises in between videos to really hammer the concepts home.",3
The course is interesting and well taught. The professor is very enthusiastic and it makes the course fun to watch. The problem in my opinion is that the content is too superficial. It's completely lack of mathematical background and the programming exercises are sometimes no more than copy paste.,3
"Just as the Amy Bloom's course, this course has no descriptive arch and one is left to try and grasp the teaching points in a flood of reference material. Teach theory in a clear structure first please then provide reference. See Brando Skyhorse course, very structured.",3
"All of the review I've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem. However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work. I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials. One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show. Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased. I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983. I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them. All of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great.",3
"The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
There are some errors on the quizzes in between the videos. I had to skip a lot of them because it wound't accept the correct answer. I liked the testimonial videos.,3
Too shallow. It's just common sense and a little of vocabulary.,3
"The course presents the topics in a non-linear manner. It should be called ""Learning graphs with C++""",3
"The content is good, but the way the lectures are given not so much.",3
Too high level,3
"Great videos. Teacher awesome.But the course needs, in order to be better, more practical activities and i got a little bit upset when I worked hard in final project and later I saw that it´s not necessary at all.....Instead, I should just did a final quiz.",3
very useful and well designed,3
The course is very good explained. However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components... Sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignment's core thing.,3
"Good contents, but lectures could be improved for clarity.",3
"A little bit too conceptual and very basic. Hadoop hands on and HDFS should be much more intensive. However, good material, well presented and explained.",3
I feel it's too simple and really just for beginners who know nothing about coding,3
"Now that I have completed the course I'd like to give some feedback on how I think it was.1. Quizzes are horrible. The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. It's not helpful and then it turns into a ""just keep selecting different things until it's right"" thing instead of understanding it.2. The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files5. It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background",3
"The course laid out the concepts pretty well but if one had access to the materials, the lectures were not really necessary to understand the concepts.This was because the lectures were pretty much a re-reading of the materials and more importance could be placed on creating scenarios where the processes would be applicable. This would be a far better use of the lecture time than trying to combine the two and not doing a good job of either.",3
The quality of videos was pretty poor. The question and answer format of discussion was not a great idea (might have been great for kids videos). Doesn't enthuse us to continue the course. Thanks however for putting the effort and making this available to everyone for free. Really appreciate that.,3
Fair course. Severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles. Learned a lot from the course.,3
Loved the professor. Do not like essay questions.,3
"The faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience. But the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that I have found in most Coursera courses was not present.",3
"I like the course, it is pretty good to learn screenplay, butThey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe don't understand. Submerge more in some topics and explain it.",3
"Good course , could be made better ! content is good and simple !",3
"This is an introduction course, and no advanced concepts are seen. I think it provides a good background, that is all. If you have a solid technical (programming, databases, etc.) knowledge maybe you will miss more hand-ons. For me, for an introductory and theoretical course I expected more resources, for example additional suggested readings, optional exercises...Lectures are well structured (intro and summary at the end), but I have missed presentations from some of the most interesting videos (week 6).",3
Some course content are not updated (links not working). Very few people in discussions. Didn't see TAs. I had some questions on the forum but not answered.,3
"Very basic introduction. If you have any coding experience in other languages, this will be extremely simple.",3
"It is definitely beneficial to a certain extent but I thought that it was a little dry. However I really enjoyed the time period of each video, as I am the kind of people that tends to get a restless when the teaching gets too long",3
Found it to be a bit outdated.,3
"A lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students, and was certainly not super relvant too.",3
"Useful tips, but for the little amount of material, it's not worth $70.",3
"I like the materials, but I don't like that you need to pay to take the quizzes. I think that it is against the spirit of Coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but don't have enough money to pay for the course. Many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying",3
"It's a great course! The only thing I did not fully like was the we could not learn any of the characters. I guess this course helped to develop the tones and the recognition of them, but, I think that a little shape in the characters and how each sound could improve this course a lot.",3
Easy to understand,3
"extremely short & easy - fun-ducation. Not hugely informative for someone who's looking to learn about the links between what we eat and how we eat, and how human bodies respond. But the instructor is very charming, so it was a pleasant experience. The whole course can be completed in 1-2 hours",3
Very difficult to follow if you are not a programmer.,3
"To tackle such key concepts and tools of statistics, you need the appropriate time. Too much material covered in this course. I tend to think that revising the approach to this course as two 4 weeks modules would allow to both go more in depth at a more appropriate pace.",3
"Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes. I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe. How to transform the data. And how to merge dataframes together. The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly. It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer.",3
"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes. Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested.",3
"The content was good, however Prof Clifton is very difficult to listen to and watch on the videos. Mistakes in the PPT and her presentation skills do not meet the expected standard. She seemed as though she didn't know the material and is seemingly unaware of what is required for successful on-camera delivery of lectures.",3
Good content..but should also have some graded excercises,3
Week 1 & 2 not terribly useful; week 3 (in depth look at actions within dashboards) & 4 (significant content relating to building a story) are what I expected the class/series to be.,3
"Programming instructions were not clear, and the version of Python that was installed on my machine did not support the Jupy",3
"If you've not read a single book on writing, this class might be good. Otherwise, don't expect to get much about the ~30 minutes of lecture.",3
Too basic.,3
"Need way more content, and accesibility to begginers, gap between theory and practical exercises is too big!",3
This course is way tooooooo easy for me. I'm a PhD candidate in statistics. I think it will be nice if I can have a diagnostic survey to test whether this course is suitable for me or not before the course.,3
"For the eager student maybe some more resources should have been shared. I was hoping to learn some production quality environment basics e.g. the ideal editor, best practices etc.That said- I really liked how the 3 components, css, js and html were stitched together to help understand interactive webpages using js.",3
"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques.",3
"Lot of talking, lack of visual, templates, etc.",3
The examples are getting very abstract. It is getting difficult to understand the concepts with the examples explained.,3
"The MOOC was good and full of hidden treasures. Unfortunatelly, last week had a very low quality - it was the only part I wasn't able to take out anything. Week , on the other hand, was full of interesting techniques prsented in weekly homework and surely worth further investigation. To sum up: I'm glad I finished it, but I suggest to rearrange it's form - add some videoes, and remove other ones.all the best,Piotr Milewski",3
Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,3
"Explanations is pretty well, but it is not so difficulty. So it's good for beginners.",3
"This course was mostly self learning. It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different. The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along. It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will. It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments. I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.",3
"Good course, but the SWIRL exercises (and a few quiz questions) needed to be updated for the latest version of ggplot2.",3
This was a good series for beginners.,3
"Not finding it very useful, but it's good to know about the concepts and theories for each type of experiments.",3
"Some good tips, nothing terribly new for those who have had a course in statistics. Materials made easy to digest. The variety from the 3 instructors was nice. Missed opportunity: to combine the best aspects from each. The course notes were either excerpts from R.Peng's books /blogs (good) or automated transcripts (complete with typical AI typos... ""wait"" instead of ""weight""). Some lectures were repetitive from one course to another. Slides with examples were useful, slides with clip-art and comic stips less so. Tries to be something for everyone. Would be better to aim either at former DS analysts aspiring to be managers or seasoned managers trying to better understand DS.",3
Not enough guidance for final project.,3
"The course content of this course is not much and thus one can finish it rather very quickly. However one of the lecturer's had such a heavy accent I had to use subtitles just to understand the content. I am not in anyway in the fashion industry nor aspiring to be so this was just like a ""tester"" for me. I was however surprised that its not all about modelling and the sorts but incorporates some business aspect about the fashion industry.",3
excellent course but should be more in depth,3
"The course is very helpful, but it's an extremely messy program and needs more work done to it.",3
HTML/CSS - easyJS - extremely hard,3
"The course is OK, but in my opinion the price 69€ is higher for the material you learn.Lower price probably more people take the course payingAlso is a pitty that people we do not want to pay, we could not have a final assignement.",3
"Week 4 - too much of materials, and test questions does not match the text",3
Overview with key terminology and process information. Good introduction and/or refresher.,3
"The course has incredible content, but you are required to read quite a bit of information via lengthy pdfs prior to the videos. This is not my learning style so I found it challenging.As a Naturalist and bird lover, I was eager to take the course and glad that I did.",3
"This was a kind of basic course without enough examples. That being said, the most interesting part of the course is prototyping section. I am looking forward to hearing more about that aspect of design.",3
"There has been very few on-hands training. It's still very very at an introductory level. At some points it goes very deep, for example with the vectors for a document, but with the rest stay at a very high level. Open an excel sheet can not be considered training ...",3
"The quizes and tests had trivial answers, almost all could have been answered without watching the videos. More additional resources and a block on adult transgender persons, rather than just a couple of token transgender adults who are Stanford professors, would be nice. The videos were good, especially the ones involving children. The videos with professors were decent but could have been better.",3
Parts of videos were distracting and dragged on for longer than necessary.,3
"Last week's content was thrown together from various bits & parts from the Functional Reactive Programming in Scala (or whatever the name of the predecessor of this course was).Overall, I felt that there was a lot of ground covered in a short amount of time - the course would have been better if it was longer, and week 4 material would have benefitted from being stretched into two or three weeks. Rather than reuse parts of the old course it would have been better to have new content purpose built for this course.",3
"Course design is pretty uneven in pace, engagement and expectation setting. The interactive segments could be better. Also, the core content feels like a hodge-podge of different sources thrown together to support the Professor's lexicon.",3
The course content is very superficial. The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest. You have to get 80% to pass. One unit in particular was very confusing. It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.,3
I liked the emphasis on the spoken language and the bullets on China and its culture. I wish we had also the Chinese characters as in the first course; there were problems with the computer assessment of some of the quizzes.,3
less interactive,3
Nice course but I would have expected more techniques (SVM for instance),3
"A lot of good information, but I found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation. Assignment were quite hard, and instructions were a bit too sketchy.",3
"The course is excellent and cover many tasks that usually you perform with R. However, on my opinion assignments are not really focused on the topic of the classes, they are not really explained and above the grade of the classes.",3
"The course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts. Also during the course, the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand. The practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me. Hence, hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated.",3
This course requires solid grounding in mathematics. No meant of Social Science graduates without proper training in statistics/mathematics. The course was good in the sense that we could how probability distributions are used to model real world problems.Study material was certainly not adequate.,3
"Worth doing, but hardly enough content for 4 weeks.",3
All algorithms were black boxed. It was a nice course on how to use Dato's GraphLab and an overview of ML concepts.,3
"Interesting, and helpful.",3
This was a very necessary but boring class.,3
The course gives a clear and means ideas about how communicate in works areas.,3
"I really do not like the R language, I think it is sloppy and inconsistent. This class did ok teaching the basics of R, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code (a key part of writing code!), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on. In other words, it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in R.",3
Some of the videos made too long by unnecessary clips from hollywood which illustrate the point but are too long. The assignment of the final week felt tacked on and not at all related to what was taught that week.,3
The professor is excellent and presentation materials are very good. I gave only three stars because much of the course content is outdated by over 5 years and in some cases over 10 years!. This is unacceptable in a digital marketing college level course because the technology evolution cycle is getting shorter with each passing year and some of the case study examples are now obsolete.,3
"Good course, but worth only for really basic learners.",3
"Good course, but too much data for the modules to fully grasp without a background.",3
I didn't enjoy this course as much as the others. Particularly due to the fact that I am only looking for hands on knowledge on how to develop a game and not create a business around it.,3
Very Slow...,3
The level of the exercises and quizzes don't reflect the content of the course.,3
"This class is very easy. It is a decent introduction, but has very little content. It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly. The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking critically. It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge. I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster.",3
"The language style used in the course makes it a little hard to follow, and I was a bit disappointed with how the whole class was left alone. Some of the materials mentioned in the course were hard or impossible to find. Some of the assignments didn't have a place to submit anything. Also the title of the course looks incorrect "" the Humankind's"". Despite all of that, I've learned some valuable information. Thank you.",3
"I think this course is a relatively well put together, gentle introduction to machine learning. It would be good for people with zero experience with ML, who might be overwhelmed by other ML courses (Ng, Abu-Mostafa) out there. This course would not be useful for anyone who has any previous knowledge of ML.Many reviewers have taken issue with the software used. I actually liked the Dato libraries a lot, but I'd be uncomfortable using proprietary software for research. I thought it was friendly enough to be appropriate for this kind of intro class, and I really enjoy iPython notebooks for interactive teaching.I rated this course a 3 because of the price for the full course. This part of the specialization should be free. It does not provide enough instruction, practice, or content for the cost. Multiple choice quizzes are used to grade the programming assignments, so there is no feedback from the instructors. These answers are not made available to students in the free tier, which flies in the face of open learning. I am disappointed in the recent push to monetize courses. Please don't pay for this one.",3
A decent introduction to the topic.,3
The course needs an update. Really poor presentation of the material although a lot of things are covered.,3
I think the jump in difficulty from week 1 to week 2 is discouraging to many students with little to no R experience.,3
"This Course needs a Update, im really disappointed of Week 4 and the Assignments are Outdated and nothing new",3
"This course should be longer and more in depth. However, I did find the readings quite useful and intriguing.",3
"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3
"Great course for Teachers or those, like me, who want to gain general knowledge. I like the diversity of reading, video content and quizzes and the aspects of geology that were covered.",3
"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.",3
"A good course to understand the basics of Python, though there's no difference between the book chapters and the video lectures (lectures are basically readings of the chapters) - I expected more info in general.",3
"Very open way of learning. Few talks with people from the industry, sharing their approach.Not much of fundamental knowledge.Generally great motivator to exercise Character Design. Not that great resource to learn from a beginning.",3
The course only contains a basic introduction to chineese. You need further sessions to learn a language completely and to have any significant benifit from the effort put in.,3
"What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki. The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.",3
"I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class, but I don't feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime. The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons. I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning. It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week.",3
Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,3
"This class started out very rocky and the videos had errors, the quizzes had problems, and the assignments had a poor grading system. Hopefully, these will be corrected in future offerings.",3
"This is a great course taught by a clever teacher but...The content is presented in a very dry, not easy to grasp, manner. In several cases, I had to use external sources to understand the content and/or derive it by myself. When I finally understood the content I couldn't understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advanced.Professor Caffo is a good communicator in some occasion (the module on Power for example was incredibly well communicated). But most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts, as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about. (Not the case!)I plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information, derivations and concepts. But this takes a lot of time. If/when it will be completed, I will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students. Because, honestly, the content of this course is not so hard and shouldn't be!",3
"Helpful ideas, but could use some more practical suggestions.",3
I think this course is ok but it is not enough.,3
"In all it's a good course to know some basics, but the data and some of the informations are out of date. It seems most datas are from late 2012 early 2013, things have changed.",3
"Pretty good overview for simple business metrics definitions and basic level analysis. It is a good refresher for those with an analytics background, but also puts things in a perspective from a business setting which is good for when you are working in the field.",3
The site is not very user friendly. The information is good though.,3
"I did like the course, it was informative. However, there didn't seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves, and the grading by peers didn't make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got. The quizzes were also really easy, which again, made me feel like I didn't deserve the grade. It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn't take up too much of their time.",3
Informative. Good introduction to basics in Project Management. Might have been helpful to have more case studies.,3
"Learning R is very interesting and applicable. It is something I plan to continue, but not in the specialization offered here. The main reason being that the difficulty of the assignments seemed far beyond the material presented in the lectures. It could be that relevant examples on using applicable functions to aid in completing assignments were not presented in the lectures.",3
"Skillful instructor, but terrible technical setup, and plenty of faults in the lecture slides in the videos. Also the audio-quality is poor.",3
"Hello, as previous ones, this cousrse gives you basic understanding of the field and provide you with some additional materials for learning. It depends on you, whatever you study or don't. Speaking about me I would like to say thanks to the lecturer , althought the I'm not very interesting in any kind of research , thank you for your time and videos. Will review it once again to renew some ideas.",3
This course should be a free trial for whole specialisation. IT will be more helpful for students to know what is further stored in the specialisation.,3
"Excellent for absolute beginners! But, if you have good experience in CSS & JavaScript you might play it at 1.5X, it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little, it might be boring, then.Generally, the course is very informative, rich, instructions based and have very good exercises covering all the course content with a good-as-a-start hands on experience.",3
Videos took to long. and uh fnck y=u,3
The content is good and easy to follow but lack depth.,3
"This is not a bad quality-price course but after working Accounting and Finance IESE courses I have to say that this one does not have the same level. To improve specially content organization: firt week is very heavy comparing with the others. The first and the last videos of the course, in Starbucks, in a very windy day, they have a very bad audio. The fourth week exam doesn't offers the pdf of the results. In final exam results they say 3,8 is 45% of 15,3 ¿?... Anyway, I expect more quality in the next course of the program ""Managing people""...",3
"The course itself is easy to follow and informative. However, the programming relates primarily to animations so is most appropriate for those interested in design, game design, etc. The course description should better specify this.",3
"This course offers very useful high level overview of concepts and ideas which make you feel confident in the long run. However, the course is extremely basic and does not go deep beyond the high level concepts. The hands on exercises are boring and do not engage students. The course needs to be improved to make it more useful for students. This course is not very worthy of the money.",3
"I think the course was too superficial and didn't cover enough topics to be a standalone course. It could be part of a greater course. My feeling is that this wasn't worth $30 dollars, and that such a small course was put together just to charge for one more module.",3
"Very basic, but some things are useful, the course is worth it if you are a total newbie",3
"It was ok, rather basic really, but I suppose that is what some people need.",3
"Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!",3
Interesting course,3
"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot.I thought the video lectures were a little sparse. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit.More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture.So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot.",3
"Much better than the first course on the specialization. More structured, easier to follow. The final assignment was challenging but not out of reach.",3
not so interesting and boring,3
"Shame that the format was changed and the quizzes and assignments were not open. Teaching was as great as the first 2 courses, and slides were useful.",3
Can improve.,3
It is not any technical 'lab based exercise bases I mean',3
"The content is really an interesting topic that I'm sure a lot of learners with enjoy. However, the way it is presented needs a lot of work. First, the slides are not masterfully made; proper word count and transitions are not applied. Second, the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning, it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut. Third, it is repetitive and there's too much focus on the unnecessary, the lecture needs to be reviewed. Cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic. However, the lessons were not presented creatively enough.",3
Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation,3
pretty good!,3
"The instructor is sub par,. Questions are a bit vague",3
PDF Course (Like a school),3
Top free course about Data Science. But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments. And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.,3
"I think that , this course need to add more keys critical important point in each lesson by keywords on Videos. And examples how to use these skill on nature life",3
The introduction of how to use github is undetailed in my opinion.,3
I like this course it is very easy because of the trainer,3
The theories for the models should be explained in more detail and with few more examples.,3
Clear and essenzial focus on the main aspects,3
"Brian Caffo is a brilliant mind. I am sure, but in a way for me it is difficult to follow. In parallel I checked out Khan Academy and it was easier to understand.",3
The difficulty of assignments should be increased.,3
if you're a somewhat experienced programmer looking to start and hand on learn how to build apps this course is not for you.,3
"It is a good course, but the quiz/exercises are very difficult, and sometimes, unrelated to the topics",3
"The videos are really boring, however the course is good.",3
Found 1/5 of the content useful.,3
"Course was good, but the material covered was at a fairly high level and done too quickly. This course could use some demos and since its a core foundation for the rest of the courses, maybe it should be a longer more in-depth program.",3
I thinks it only happens to me. I found things are a little unorganized for me who doesn't speak English as mother tongue. But the videos and quizzes help me a lot to understand.,3
"The professor is very good. However, pictures and graphics mean a thousand words. These lectures rely too much on words. It makes it how to visualize the concepts. Hope to see more pictures. Animation will be the best.",3
The course is good for getting an overall idea of the main topics of finance but not on getting a deep understanding on them,3
"Its ok, I didn't learn a little and I didn't learn a lot.",3
"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course. Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer. This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone. The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise.",3
There could be more work in the assignments in this course. The Quizzes are very simple.,3
This course is not for javascript beginners. You should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program.,3
course is too slow and the videos need some corrections,3
"Different, fun approach. Basic science.",3
"Easy to get in, now I know the basics of Python.. however, maybe too much extra stuff and discussion about this and that.",3
"Could have more in depth content, a bit shallow sometimes.",3
Is not a completed and structured course. It needs more examples to get the idea exactly,3
"Overall a decent course to audit, but I think it was almost too repetitive and lacked a lot of substance. It would have been nice to really focus on great content types, versus share, share, share.",3
"There is a high disparity between lecture content and the knowledge required to complete the assignments. It would be great to have a complete walk through of each assignment, showing the different ways in which the same functionality can be created, after having submitted an assignment. This would really had helped me to better understand why something is done in a certain way and improved my understanding of how R works. Currently there is zero feedback on completed assignments, which does not aid learning.",3
It was Ok. I would have liked to learn a bit more about monads / monoids etc and I found the final week a bit disconnected.,3
"Good course, but I think the previous courses of the specialization are better organized and structured than this one.",3
Very basic Course. It involves a lot of GUI Concepts which may not be useful for general programmers.,3
Algorithms in lectures were useless to programming assignment,3
I believe the assessments focus on insignificant details mentioned in the presentations rather than the big ideas that I believed was the crux of the course.,3
The course is really good and the professor well prepared. It should include more real life examples and it should analyze a real PE firm or fund. Most of the courses are abstract and they do not analyze a real life case.,3
This great course and greate insturactor,3
"The lectures and resources are good quality and offer a lot of information. However, the peer reviewed assignment needs revising.I submitted all the assignments early for the course, making sure to get in my peer reviewed assignment a week early to ensure that if I needed to, I could resubmit and have time for grading. I did not receive a grade on my assignment until after the deadline was passed. My assignment was mis-reviewed by my peers, clearly they did not read my paper, they just clicked randomly at the grading options. This caused me to fail by a few percentage points. I resubmitted my assignment that day, highlighting the content the graders missed. I still do not have a grade on this assignment and fear I will fail the class.The reason I bring this up in my review is that there is no contact information for the instructor. There is no process to dispute the grade. The assignment needs an overhaul if you expect people to take the assignment to pass the class.",3
not bad but not excellent,3
I wish that the classifications of the major cancer groups were more descriptive. concerning the treatment for different types of lung cancer for example. Nothing is mentioned about childhood cancers or the area of lymphomas. I realize that this is an overview of cancer but cancer cell biology and current treatment practices based on immunologic findings were not given the coverage they deserve.,3
"Its good, but I feel a little bit of disparity between the level of detail given in lecture vs the reading. Meaning that the lecture is comfortable and easy going and the personal work and reading is a bit more advanced.",3
"While I did enjoy this course, I found it to be less useful than the first two in the series. I also noticed a lot of repetition from the course before. I think my expectation was to learn more about imagemaking in a digital sense, but I'm still happy overall that I took this course and I can't wait to earn my specialization.",3
Longer than it should be,3
"Slides were informative, but the lecturer did not add anything to them. One could complete the course by purely reading the slides.",3
Definitely recommended for people who have no clue about European law whatsoever. Its informative but partly the course fails to set the right priorities. For example: IMHO it makes little sense to ask for numbers of paragraphs in the quizzes - its not only a waste of time to learn them by heart but also it hinders the participants to show their understanding of the material.,3
Several mistakes on the translations of the exams,3
It's easy to start python with this.,3
"Better than Stat Inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved I think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas. Some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means.",3
"lectures are too long, it lacks clinical correlation.the course focus only technical lab issues, when you look for antimicrobial resistance course, the last thing that you need is tech theory. Of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis, but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance. So there is a need for clinical correlation. If its not present, the course should be entitled ""Laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance""",3
"Very weak on modern-day best development practices, and many of the ""phases"" discussed are closer to the anti-pattern of Waterfall, not Agile. I'm surprised to see an entire course on Software Product Management without a single mention of Lean principles.",3
coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps,3
"lots of dry theory, not as practical as I expected",3
It is somehow good ... not excellent!,3
a bit boring,3
"Very helpful for people who are new to the field. However, I do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly; often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given.",3
"Great job on the course material and labs, quizzes and the final exame however, tend to be very confusing.",3
"The course provides a very thorough introduction on the basic models and mechanisms by which various financial products are priced. One issue I had, was that the quiz questions sometimes used terminology or jargon for which the link with the material covered in the videos was not always immediately obvious. Also, the course, especially the later modules, heavily relies on Microsoft Excel, which some people might not be willing to pay hard cash for. It is possible to pass by doing the assignments with e.g. Python, but it's a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart.",3
"Well course teaches basics of python but you should always refer to python documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly. To the course staff, please update the slides where Python2 is used to python3.",3
"This course is beyond abundant in great information. However, there is almost too much information to take in , and absolutely too much information to be able to study in just and hour a day. It needs to be stretched out into 6 weeks instead of 4 to accommodate those with an already busy schedule. For example, one 8 minute video might require an allotment of one hour to properly glean all the provided information. You will need to take notes on almost every word spoken so the pattern will be hit play, pause write out the last couple of sentences (the instructor speaks very quickly), hit play , pause and repeat until the end of the video and then re-watch it in order to absorb everything as one.And beware, in the peer reviews you will need to bullet and highlight EVERY point required extremely specifically in order to get full credit. For example, for the first essay, I wrote it out in ESSAY form as was specified and had all of the required points written out exactly how it was instructed. However, because I did not put into a basic outline form, I received a failed score. I resubmitted the EXACT same content in bullet-ed and highlighted form (which was NOT what was assigned) and miraculously received 100%.",3
It was a good overview. I understand that it’s really just a quick intro into upcoming specialization courses. I wouldn’t take it alone. But I’m excited for the rest of the courses!,3
"The extra/outside content provided is great. As others have stated, but clearly not adjusted, some of the quiz questions aren't clear items covered in the material (which is frustrating).",3
"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though",3
It seemed like course material had little to do with the assignments. Teach us how to read alphabets and assignment is to write poetry. Big jump!,3
there were several things required in the programming that was not covered in lessons. Without help from other programmers and googling a lot I could not have done this. Very complex for beginners. Also documents not updated with current information,3
This is a good introductory course to some of the tools but it doesn't go into the details of R programming or Data Science.,3
"Materials need to be updated - there are way too many inconsistencies between videos, exercises, and slides.",3
It's useful to anyone who wants to improve writing skills.,3
"If you know anything about management, specifically software engineering management, this course won't tell you anything new. It's very high level survey of best practices. I'm currently working as a software engineer on data science problems alone on my team. I wanted some idea of how data science teams are typically structured for when I need to talk about my work to my chain of command and my peers and for interacting with other dedicated data science teams at my company. I feel I got a pretty good idea of that and a better understanding the roles in an ideal team. I also feel prepared for the future if I were to apply for a role on a dedicated data science team. As far as actually building a team myself, I think this course won't really give you that if you don't already have other management experience, but it does give you some insight on the specifics of data science people. Finally, Quizzes could use some review, the answers don't often line up grammatically with the questions. Also the one with the instructor's LinkedIn profile linked doesn't work because LinkedIn covers the content and wants you to create an account. A link to a resume or something might be better.",3
"Interesting, but a little bit too easy and shallow.The material was reused from other courses without making it all fit together well.",3
A good introduction to data science.,3
"This course is a very basic introduction to Python. I have coded in other languages and found myself skipping the lectures and just reading the book and working the exercises. If I needed additional information I would use a certain YouTube resource (thanks Bucky) because his lectures are so much more useful. Also, I'm not really sure why I can't start the next course and have to wait until the start date more than a week from now. I can't seem to think of a good reason for this.",3
"I got understanding about the big data, cloud and CDN. It really help to go further studies in Big data.",3
Course only drilled down on specific aspects of excel that were inclined to regression analysis which is just one aspect used in business analysis,3
We need Angular 2,3
"Good introduction and definitely helps get started! Given we have video lectures, concepts could have been explained better by demonstrating on the R console instead of showing static slides and verbal explanation.",3
"It's a good introductory course, but it's very basic and I feel that I paid a lot for a very basic experience. I do understand it is the first step in a full specialization but I think it can be more challenging.",3
"At later stages also , examples should be used for explanation !",3
"This is a very easy course, i would definitely recommend it to any beginner in HTML.",3
The approach of teaching has to be changed more examples with clear explanation has to be given.,3
"It presents a lot of different aspect of macro economics in a really short time which is good. But because of that, it doesn't give a good understandings of each problem.Nice introduction, but I will start another class on the subject which I would have liked to avoid.",3
"No engagement from faculty, if you have questions regarding anything in the course, no one will answer them. Unclear and incomplete instructions for assignments. Overall, probably my worst experience with Coursera.",3
It was an amazing experience,3
THANK YOU!,3
"Course is good in general but ""HIERACHICAL CLUSTERING"" part is hard to understand and is not clear, should be explained more.",3
"The teacher seems really nice and explains things really clearly, however the content of this course is not as helpful as I believed. It gave me a few new techniques to better administrate my time, but nothing that will revolutionize the way I work.",3
"Not useful by itself, but grudgingly necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization.",3
"Meh. Very basic intro; not the more advanced class I anticipated, based on the first in the sequence.",3
Nice review of all things learned during College.,3
The course was too easy.,3
"I think It's too little amount of material. It is very shame, that there aren't any exercise after each week.",3
Not enough coding opportunities.,3
It's very general information. The explanation movies are great.,3
Get ready for a course that assumes you have all the software they use already installed without advanced notice or instructions!,3
"In my opinion, the final exam was weak since it was compacting the quizzes throughout the course. The content could be 50% theory and 50% practice which i consider that it was more theoretical.",3
"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better",3
This is a good start up course to learn about tinkering fundamentals.,3
"It was good but little bit too fast, and not obvious, i suppose it would be better it was over 6weeks for HTML5 things only.",3
Needs to cover a bit more,3
It's sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners. They should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show. As it happens when Brian Caffo explains the blocking adjustments part.,3
"Good overview, but very detailed and definitely not for beginners - especially due to a lack of personal attention. I have had to supplement a lot of the material I missed through other resources. Still, a fairly good overview of CSS3 for those who already have a little understanding.",3
Too fast...,3
"I wanted to like this course but It felt entirely too academic in terms of both the subject matter and the way the specifics of ""data science"" are presented. The course content reminded me of my time a few years ago when I was enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a major Tier 1 research university. The professors were great, but the content was esoteric and incredibly focused on research based ""data science"" and less on business analytics or more practical applications of data science for the working professional. I felt myself re-watching the videos to try and understand the content because there were many instances where the professors' spoke about some fundamental aspect of data science but failed to provide some real world context. I liked the course but I would not recommend it as a crash course for the working professional, more like a crash course for someone who already has a degree in statistics/math/engineering who is looking to further their studies in an academic setting where research is the main goal.",3
the course is very good. Good explanations.there should have been more assessments in between the videos for the topic that is taught.too much is covered at once.,3
"Pretty basic knowledge. in my humble opinion, the questionnaires are obviously used for the research of the tutors, without offering so much learning benefit to the students. But good stuff to know.",3
"Very long but easy videos, lots of repeating material. I would not recmmend this course for someone who - like me - needs fast intro to python. However, programming assignments are good and so are the Quizes.",3
I enjoyed the hands-on aspect of this course. I learned more about using Tableau from it that the prior courses in the specialization. I give this 3 of 5 stars for 3 reasons:1) My classmates and I think that the instructor left one video out the course which is necessary to answer one of the quiz questions.2) The instructions for at least 2 of the peer-graded assignments are incomplete. The grading criteria requires features that aren't mentioned in the instructions. As a result you need to alter and resubmit the assignments in order to meet all the grading criteria.3) The instructor repeats himself in the course videos. He's present a summary of the video while displaying a Tableau screenshot and then repeat the same summary while displaying a Presentation slide. I feel that more time should have been spent reviewing the Tableau features and eliminate the repetition of the material.,3
Very basic overview of the tools and installation of them. Should be an optional course rather than part of the specialization.,3
The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments,3
"While there were many typos in screenshots and code examples, this course has been a tremendous help to me as I reinforced some things I already knew about JavaScript and learned new concepts about the JavaScript language (like coding in events or working with the DOM). I definitely feel like a more confident programmer, even though I do wish the instructor could've explained some things in more detail (like when to use the dot attribute notation over the setAttribute method).",3
I would say a fundamental course for VLSI.,3
"Good intro course, but that's all it is - an intro course. Expect great interviews and lecture videos, but don't expect too in-depth of a course. My review is biased because I already took Music Business Foundations from Berklee on Coursera and the material w",3
"Although the information provided by the course is good, I do find it a bit difficult to listen to the videos. In truth, I typically read through the transcripts instead of watching them. I understand the the professor is attempting to provide an interesting and engaging experience, but I end up feeling as though I'm being talked to like I'm a child.",3
"The videos did not seem very interactive. The teacher just read the slides. Good as an introduction, but not very hand-on course.",3
This course has a lot to do with math and statistics and I find it really hard to follow especially when it comes to the final project.,3
Pretty good course for beginners.,3
Great informative course,3
"Very interesting course for those who want to fully understand the inner workings of a computer.However, the utilities offered are a bit neglected. Be prepared to fight bugs on your own.",3
"I understand that many people want to quickly jumping on the topic, but there should be a minimum set of prerequisites before starting this class. This would avoid digressions such as explaining basic vector/matrix operations or unnecessary calculus reviews.",3
Decent course. Could be put together a lot nicer.,3
"This is a course to get you set up with all of the tools that you will need to go forward. No hard homework, but you will be ready to work. The intros into various aspects of the curriculum also serve to prepare you mentally for the coming weeks.",3
Good overview. Helpful introduction to topics covered in the specialization.,3
"to simple, not sure enough practice to be good at python",3
Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.,3
I expected something a little more faced paced from Berklee. But it was still good.,3
"For someone who's been a senior software engineer for a bunch of years, the topics on design patterns and tactics could have dug a bit deeper.",3
This is all information I already have in my arsenal after researching health trends and learning more about how I should eat. I was hoping for something a little more detailed.,3
As a medical student I find this course pretty easy.,3
Topics were OK but the focus on R and no other tools is frustrating,3
"A clear, if fairly basic, introduction. The lack of discussion forums makes it a fairly sterile experience.",3
"In the beginning it feels like a course, but from week three on it feels more like a conversation about food. It is more suitable for people with very little background n food science and nutrition, aiming to get some knowl on these fields. But the views are quite one sided and necessarily true when it comes to the understanding of the food chain. Of course, many of their opinions are valid, but I wouldn´t accept those views as solid rock statements because they are not.In any case, I recomend the course for people with obesity problems and those who are too lazy to think about the importance of home cooking.The quality of the videos is outstanding! Congratulations!",3
It was short and interesting... and that is good. In the first week the readings were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented. Some of the quiz questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner. Final assignment was good.,3
"I totally liked the hands-on approach and the nice presentation of the material. On the other hand, I felt a little left alone since there was no didactically planned interaction beyond the peer reviews. Furthermore, a forum for discussion is nice, but it's a little sad if no one can answer course related formal questions, you misinterpret the instructions, and therefore receive a low grade.",3
Great course.,3
"With many thanks to the instructors, I expected to learn more. I did not learn as much as a 4-week course in Coursera. Please include more materials and avoid advertising for other topics in the future courses!",3
Gives a basic overview of data collection processes.,3
Assignment is only allowed for students who purchased the course. I don't think this is a way to encourage learning.,3
useful for basics only,3
I found some of the instructional videos a bit confusing. It was difficult to understand the underlying methodology of some of the concepts explained. I believe the instructors assumed the students had a more rigorous understanding of the underlying calculus than was suggested for this course.,3
good course,3
"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",3
"The content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology, but it is somewhat, if not totally, a false representation of interaction with the experts. There is absolutely none. Some seems repetitive from course one.",3
"I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!) but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them.",3
Not so inpiring,3
"This course isn't what I anticipated. I see where many topics related to ""marketing in a digital world"", but most if any had a indirect relationship.",3
"The teacher is great at performing but the pace of the class is way too fast for me.The assignment is hard.But, hey, that's Berklee.",3
Content is good but there is no practice whatsoever. So much theory can become boring at times.,3
Lean too heavily towards theory instead of practice. I do think peer-graded assignments work better than quiz in term of UX lessons...,3
The comparaison between Chinese and Western Culture was really useful. It was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information (at least some ints) about the long and fascinating Chinese History. More historical context would be appreciated.,3
helped me to get some basic knowledge on Project Management process,3
helpful.,3
"The exams did not explain why the wrong answers are wrong. Even after you succeed a test, I expect an explanation of the questions, and the correct answers. Even if I have a correct answer to a question, I don't know if my reasoning is correct..",3
Fair but assignments are not very well explained,3
"Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT.",3
Assignments should be free for everyone to try and be peer reviewed! Payment should only affect the certificate.,3
"Short and sweet, easy and quick and gives a genX some insight into GenY (and now GenC",3
A little light but still effective course,3
It was a great experience! Definitely gained more knowledge about diplomacy.,3
Basic but well done,3
"short, effective and precise, contain all necessary for a initial learner about Business Model Canvas. In my case, I am an intermediate learner, so it was not enough.",3
"I understand the importance of reviewing other classmates work however with the time constraints of today's world, I believe it takes away from precious time that could be spent developing the craft of writing .",3
"Although I really liked the content of this course, the videos seemed to be have been done with rush. Many of the explanations were started but not finished and the presenter had many breaks during his speech to think or to go back with a better explanation.",3
"The first two weeks the course present a reasonable pace for beginners. The second two weeks, when the Java Script is introduced, the projects suddenly become very hard. It is assumed you understand binary numbers. Coding is introduced without a lot of explanation of Java Script syntax or methods or what actually happens when you write a line of code. The idea of hiding an image within an image is interesting but I do not see that as important for beginners web developers- how is this relevant to building a web site?",3
"This course provides a good understanding of the DT steps with concrete application examples. However, it requires additional readings to be able to apply this learning",3
"Lectures and Recitals were good, easy to understand. Discussion forum was a deserted place with little sharing. Would be nice to have a more open community. Overall, pretty good. Looking forward to the next courses.",3
good but sometimes cannot hear clearly what the tutor says whenever they have strong Spanish accent.,3
A good beginning to a promising journey,3
"The positive.What a wealth of material! This is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.Clifford Saron’s Week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.The negative.Too academic for an introductory course. David Germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it. His ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible. More diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.Because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs A LOT of time. I personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.",3
"The course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quizzes and some errors in numbers. And the formula bars in the videos (i.e. formulas within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein. Participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors. Though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned. Otherwise the course was great and I would recommend it to others for the knowledge.",3
Very basic course,3
"1. please the instructor speak loud and clear. As English is not my first language.2. please the instructor and mentor check QA and answer them timely.3.Too many information to understand in 3 weeks of courses, Ruby, Rails, Gem, Bundle, Rspec, Unit Test, Black Box Test, and Food2Fork, Heroku.4. And only 3 weeks the instructor could not make these knowledge areas which I list in point 3 clear. Instructor said that we are not cover this point in this lecture in different lessons several times, so skip over something until this course finished. I suggest that add 2 more weeks to this course.5. I like the assignments from this course, these assignments job help me recall what learned in the courses.",3
"OK, big improvement from first 2 in this series",3
Good course I liked it. Very useful,3
"Some very good explanations, especially by Michel Girardin. Some other courses lack explanations.",3
"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions.Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",3
"very much interesting and hand on map of yourself or your hobby. it provide you a good and exact command that's required for you to make a good web page. so go for it , professor are very cool.",3
"Excellent content, but the instructor does not motivate",3
"This might be a great course for those who don't have any previous background in Finance/Business.The course will give you a very introductory observations about modern finance. Tests are quite simple, more suitable for high school, probably. No math required. That's a nonsense for a finance course, but still.",3
"Just three stars so far, I've just started the course late... I think it looks good tho.",3
Good for general knowledge about healthy di,3
"Overall good course that would definitely make you spend more time reading and learning on the side. Would recommend it those who have good background in college level math like Linear Algebra and a little bit of Robotics Background from a Math perspective - like working with translations, rotations, transformation matrices of that sort to make the transition easier. (There are basic robotic courses online to help with that, like Peter Corke's course). But overall this course requires some significant effort to explore the material from an external perspective.Some issues however -1. Lack of added resources like reading material to support the course and help advanced students go beyond the course themselves.2. Severe lack of activity from TA(s) on the forums. It's good that students get to interact among themselves and learn on their own, but every single post should be either answered by a TA to clarify doubts or they should acknowledge that another student's explanation was good enough to answer a particular question.3. The in-video quizzes weren't up-to-the-mark as per me. One question asked ""why"" and the answer was literally ""because that's how that algorithm is"".4. This is a trend in MOOCs and I don't think it can be helped, but perhaps more assignments that help understand the concepts better with examples would help students go beyond. If this course had such optional assignments that would be great for understanding the concepts with a more hands-on approach. But this is probably not the best platform to do so.Overall would recommend future iterations of this course, especially if the first two points above are improved upon.",3
good course,3
Good course overall,3
A good course for the beginners. The language and explanations are very very simple.,3
"The teacher is very nice.I rated it with 3 stars only because this course does not contain any information about chinese hieroglyphs. In my opinion it is the main part of the language, and should be included.",3
Information provided are good. All in this course is about theoretic knowledge. One who completes the course has to remember each points when designing a website and also implementing. Further improvements required in this course to make sure more knowledge when taking this course.,3
Could have been one of the best on Coursera but a little broard in scope and not for beginners as more is required than taught.,3
"I think its good that its given reference material for further readings, but this shouldn't exonerate you from explaining the details of the language, if I wanted to learn swift from apple's documentation I would be there right now, not here, if I'm watching your course its because I expect to learn it here.",3
"It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study. I am not sure whether it will be useful in a real life, especially calculating Chi-squared and such. I also wish the professor would simplify the language in which he speaks in the lectures.",3
"It was a fun course, not sure about the educational content, but it was fun.",3
Was only videos and 2 question quizzes until the very end. I was very surprised by the assignment at the end as it was never mentioned in any of the videos. Almost didn't finish it in time because it was due right after Christmas.Would like more hands-on assignments throughout the course instead of one at the end.,3
"I actually enjoyed this class very much, but it doesn't go very deep in the topic. The questions to the quiz are very easy to answer to. In my opinion, this class is great for a general public, but it is not an university level course.",3
"Overall good course. Clean and elegant style of presentation. Some videos had some echo problems with the sound. Also there were some english typos in some slides and in video quizzes that should be corrected. I would like to seen the slides for the presentations. Also if this is going to be a series of courses wouldn't it make sense to bundle it in a specialization?Nonetheless, congratulations and thank you for presenting this course in Coursera.",3
The course covers all the necessary theoretical basica of statistics and modeling but isn't very helpful in terms of practical implementation.,3
"Good materials, but too long and drawn out.",3
"Excellent overview of plotting and clustering. However, there were a few bits that were required for good completion of the projects that weren't covered in detail. Overall an excellent course and specialization.",3
"Although Content quality was good, the content is too much less and could have been easily integrated to first course or other course in specialisation.Secondly Quiz were not challenging ,it was just too easy to pass, and this actually takes away the very reason they were employed in this course.",3
I wish there was something more interactive than videos and multiple choice questions.Maybe a simulation software or something fun like that.,3
"it was good, could be more dinamic though",3
"For prospective students who are looking to enter the biostatistics/epidemiology field in the future. This course is designed as an in depth fundamentals of biostatistics where Professor Brain Caffo dives deep into some of the key formulas, origins of statistical formulas, and theoretical aspects of statistics.Great lecture with valuable information, however, due to the lack of engagement within the lectures, it absolutely leave students who have no background of Calculus or Linear Algebra in the dust with no reference to assist them in the course. Once or if a student has a solid foundation for the topics covered in this course, this information is very insightful and understandable.you might ask yourself, someone who doesn't have a prior knowledge of the material covered in the course if you should even take part in the course, my answer would still be yes, so long as you are willing take notes, save the videos, and return back to them at a later point once you build yourself up by studying calculus, statistics, and/or linear algebra.",3
not really possible to give a higher rating.at the moment too many problems.,3
"Overall a good and useful course, however:A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to ""verbally"" visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session.B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM.",3
"it was very simple , but i expected more content",3
"While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coding we did. The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects. Since scripting is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it. Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scripting analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people.",3
"most of the contents can be found on the website of raspberry, a quick start for those interested~",3
"The course is quite good and informative in the first two weeks covering a lot of information and a lot of exercises.Week 3 is very unrelated and hard the videos and exercises are bad, and I had to do this part by myself again.Also when we get to the final course project doesn't cover any of these techniques.In my opinion, week 3 should be replaced with something more related to plotting systems and distributions, also one project would be enough.",3
"Good, but could have been a little more demanding.",3
"Only skims the surface of Big Data, even for an introduction course.",3
It's good but depend only save informations than understand it,3
"Interesting course, but recommended only for beginners.",3
"The course is fine in the content. As usual, the presentation from Brian Caffo is rather rushed and stumbling. A better presenting style would improve the course no end, but ultimately, what is covered is what you need. I generally just avoid the videos and read the slides.",3
Good course but not enough new information and knowledge as expected,3
Could do a better job of teaching more of the fundamentals involved in the Programming Assignments.,3
elementary .. good.,3
"I found the information dated and the exercises applied to digital marketing as a consumer first and foremeost secondarily as a B2C marketer. A B2B exercise would have been valuable as well because the markets act so different. Some of the exercises were not remotely useful. I did enjoy the Radiohead, Threadless, and Thingiverse exercises and learn from them.",3
"Interesting course, but the evaluation process should be reworked with weekly quizz to ensure that the main concepts have been understood and a different final exam which does not assume that you already had the opportunity to apply and reflect upon what you have learned",3
"The ideas are good, but I dislike the presentation. It's hard to read the screen and quotes when they're only on the screen for a few moments. Lengthy lists are presented, however, I need to pause the video if I want to know anything that's on the list beyond the first two points. These are often the only points explained. If one is only concerned with the spoken word, then you'll gather an okay amount of information.",3
The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught. Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose. Lenskit is painful to use and in the week 4 Honors assignment its just impossible to get the results desired by the grader. I would suggest the Teaching team to use R/python scikit instead of Java,3
I wish it had more interaction with the teachers or to at least have more level of detail on the cases. I am afraid tha as a final project it was not of a very high use for me.,3
"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just ""download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz""",3
Just for fresh beginner in this topic,3
Is a little basic introduction to InfoSEC but is nice a good to start.,3
I did not think the instructors were very engaging. For the most part they read from slide decks that were also on the screen. There should be more visuals and discussion about what it is like to work in construction management.,3
"Strategic implementation, something that people generally forget about after creating their ""marvellous"" strategies and then watch them fail. This course teaches us how not to make that mistake.The course was nicely organised, though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking. Rating on a 1-5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems, as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews. I hope it can be improved in the future!",3
Gets progressively tougher but loses momentum in the end. I highly recommend taking additional courses in R as the programming requirements are not exponentially increasing and by the end it suddenly peaks to a huge demand.,3
"Course is mostly theoretical. So far it's difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness. It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare. But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words. Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks. Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization. Thanks a lot to authors!",3
"Somehow interesting course about Data analysis. The lectures are interesting for those who have no prior knowledge about the topics, but boring to those who have it. The assignments are quite challenging and the disadvantage is, that they are not connected to the lectures and are therefore not well explained. What I like about the assignments is, that it is practical.",3
"Very informative and rewarding. Professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course. The major problem with this course is that, as complex as it is, coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions, perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with. It makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them.",3
empty of value,3
"The video quality and content were good. Unfortunately, there were a lot of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the written portions.",3
I enjoyed the topic. The lectures could be augmented by breaking them up into more pieces (particularly for Instrumental variables and double difference). It would have been nice if additional (optional) readings were listed to give interested students more direction. I also would have liked to see topics added to the course such as propensity score matching.,3
The course is not that much helpful for those who want to do work for coding. I mean the level of toughness of questions is not too good to compete any coding competition.,3
"Good overall but the content uses library and other content that make it hard to apply the technologies to the real world, an emphasis on orienting the content to 'from scratch development' would be duly appreciated I think. Nevertheless interesting and well presented over all.",3
Funny and Intuitive explanations.,3
Too few students.,3
"While I found the content and instructors to be very good, I don't feel I received any true constructive criticism that will help me with my writing. I would have preferred having an instructor review my work and provide proper feedback. I understand it costs to have someon",3
"Great overview of many models and techniques, but very high level. Would have greatly benefited from links to resources to learn more about all the subjects. This course leaves students with only basic knowledge of the subject matter, which is fine considering the course timeline. But, for those who want to explore further please recommend sources of additional reading and research.",3
"Adequate course for non-professionals in finance, although I thought they were going to explain many more themes.. to short for my expectations and excesive for the price.",3
"Quite basic - but good overview of general theory. Don't do this on its own, it's quite useless as a standalone module",3
"Good organization and lecture format, but stressfully strict rubrics on the assignments given the peer review structure.",3
Very basic,3
"I liked the professor very much, and the expert interviews were interesting. On the other side, she used a lot of articles from the internet which gave not much knowledge. I think it would be better to use more material from professional manuals, not from ""trendy"" websites.",3
Wonderful lectures with heaps of useful information including video on blended teaching in action along with teacher interviews and enthusiastic presenters. The course is self-paced though so you are relying on your fellow learners being up to the point you are for peer assessment. Also some links don't work and there is little or no interaction from the Course leaders or TA's. The lectures are well worth it though.,3
I didn't feel like I learned much. Some of the problems I've experience would take more than just trying to find common interest and compromise.A lot of conflicts arise from personal agenda and gain and that's very difficult to deal with.,3
Lessons and videos are very long for one week.,3
Good but nowhere near as in-depth as some of the other courses found on coursera.,3
"I thought the videos and interviews were great but I would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material. I kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people. I would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research. Where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects. I enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course ""zoomed in"" to me and seemed too ""zoomed out""",3
"It's a good course, In the last lesson miss more examples.",3
"Basic overview of Typographical ideas, terms and so forth. A bit short and not very technical, but playing with Type as an integral part of design was really fun and inspirational.",3
"Since I'm working on water modelling (computational fluid dynamics, programming shallow water simulations), I thought it would be fun to learn more about the political side. However, this course has very little in-depth information (pun not intended) and I would like to know more about the actual tools used to design water policies. Though the course is most likely too easy for most university students, it is also very abstract and I would have liked having to do a little more thinking on the real-world examples myself.",3
"Interesting to try R hands on. Could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test (there was lots of 'you could have a look at this analysis, or this one, or this one' without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case). Some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about R syntax, although the follow up answers were good if you didn't understand what was expected.",3
"The course may be called Pro Tools Basics but this requires also basic audio knowledge. It shouldn't be explaining about microphones and how to connect an XLR cable.Also it was more a course on how to compose electronic music on Pro Tools rather than using Pro Tools for recording and editing. I mean not so many people use Pro Tools for composing. Pro Tools is a global standard for recording, editing, mixing and mastering. I was waiting to learn more things on these topics and not on EDM...P.S.I really like EDM but this shouldn't be the main focus of the course!",3
"I understand peer review is a bit difficult, but being quiz only made this course a bit too easy. Colleen is a great teacher though and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.",3
Course is good but the assignment are too basic. I would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating.,3
"toughest of all , very tough",3
"The best part of this course was, of course, the videos. But it just scratched the surface. I would have been happy to have a whole unit on Eudora Welty or B B King or the Chitlen Circuit. Each and every one of the films was priceless. But the course didn't fully exploit the possibilities of the web and I felt it was very static.",3
"Useful if you want to take PMP exam, beginner info about PM, but not very deep.",3
"This course needs tremendous improvement. In contrast to previous fundamentals of quantitative modelling module, this lags in lot of areas. No clear explanations and the quizzes are worded super vague and filled with with bugs. I expected a lot under Monte Carlo Simulation. However, too simplistic example and explanation was presented. The topics were not introduced clearly.",3
"Not much content covered in course, especially compared to Aerial Robotics. No real great sense of achievement on completion.",3
"Very interesting, but I found it a little bit confusing.",3
"most contents are explicit on ppt, it is sometimes not necessary to view the lectures.",3
"The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering. Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5. My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though.",3
"While this course is interesting and informative, I was hoping that there would be a larger portion dedicated to jobs, industries, and ideas that help make the world a better place. I was hoping that by the end of this course, I would have learned about many more options on how to act now, today, as opposed to such a strong emphasis on the origin and meaning of ethics.",3
"Instead of interviewing different people, it could have animations and infographics to explain the research methods.",3
"the course, probably, was good, but it was presented in rather boring and slow manner, so in the end I completely lost interest, and was skipping through the lectures.If it could be done in more lively and engaging manner, it would have been great",3
It's a good approach to electronics but it doesn't go trough a complete explanation about how we found the formula needed to solve problems.,3
Difficult and kind of tedious subject. Professor knows his stuff but has a foreign accent. Makes it a little difficult at times.,3
visualized examples? - good content but lacked engagement,3
"Course material is not enough, you need to also refer at least one reference book as well.",3
"It is a good introductory course, but the technical aspect for this module is bad...",3
Please put more content. The content is very less.,3
well!!it was interesting.,3
"Even do the Research subject was very interesting, this capstone was a total disappointment.The Capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience, receiving peer's complaints due to the fact that many got bad grading.Also, many peers complaint about the image of the Specialization Certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook.",3
I would of like to study succesful cases with performance indicators and their impact in sustainable development of their action region.,3
This course took a lot of work to create. I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more. The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome.I did really enjoy the course. Thank you.,3
The lectures were somehow chaotic.,3
I found the persistent reading of the slides to be a little tedious. A little more interactive activity would have been nice.,3
"Very overwehelming with lots of names and without explanation, just like real lection in real university.",3
Potentially interesting and useful material presented in boring and sometimes unclear manner. Quizzes failed to correlate to the material in the lectures. Got something out of the course but the potential was there for much more.,3
Good overview... but expected more content..,3
"While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project, I didn't feel like the assignment's requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series. As someone who bought this course as one large pack (four courses, one capstone project), it would've been nice to see more intersection. I felt a little ""in the dark"" on some of this. Given the short timeline to finish the work, too, many of these requests need more time (e.g. building personas needs user research, ideally). All in all, a good challenge to a content professional, but don't expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series.",3
"The later part of the sessions lacks practical applicability and it is more abstract, that I find difficult to relate",3
Tests and quizzes don't really ask the right things and the answers given are hard to understand. Bad quizzes but lectures informative.,3
The course does not have much videos and some of the lecturers (especailly week 5) talk TOO FAST. The subject is abstract and hard enough and talking too fast makes it harder.,3
It's a decent course. Not as thorough as Analytics Edge or Machine Learning (by Andrew Ng).,3
Nice abstraction about all kinds of games not about a specific game genre. But I'm not into it because I like developing games more than thinking about design. This course's homework is somewhat irrelevant of the course content.,3
It was an interesting class though the scale of difficulty was very low. I would improve this course by adding more technicalities.,3
"Short and concise. The course strongly aims for USA residents who eat too much. If you are that person, this course is perfect. As someone from another country without health problems, there was not much here. I was hoping to learn more about food and how to optimize my diet so as to increase energy, improve mood, increase life-expectancy, and reduce chances for depression. I found nothing about that. But it's not so bad because the course took me less than 3 hours and I still picked up a few things :).",3
"Some few interesting insights on epistemology, but nothing more",3
"Content is good. I found the information in the videos valuable, albeit short and leaving me wanting more. I suppose that's what research is for. In general great and short course to get one on track with research methods.Take this course, as it is good.So why three stars?I know it is a long review, and feel free to remove it from the list, if you deem it appropriate. I have learned a lot in the course, and it is a valuable experience still.My problem lies with the design of the course, that seems to have started with great vigour at then lost the steam at the end. I would like to suggest few pointers. Especially since the presenters have another courses in the catalogue with similar issues.1. Help learners to focus - Body language, and position in the room. Standing in front of windows with the traffic outside may seem a minor thing, but it detracts form you and the content. As a course designer it is a responsibility to set it right. Same applies for hands in back pockets, posture when sat down, lens flare etc.2 - As instructors you have offered very little teaching. All was left to the guest speakers. All very good and knowledgeable. Some graphic and own mini lecture would help to establish you as experts (not that you are not, but we would not know that from the videos), rather than mere interviewers. (Summary of what was said).3 - match the video and e-tivity focus. And think about the accessibility of the material to your learners, especially if no previous knowledge is required. Week three was about managing research and planning. The reading, was surprisingly different (week 4 activity would be more suitable here) and really hard to access to someone, who hasn't done much reading in theories of knowledge etc. This would be more accessible as a guided lecture and quiz, rather than 400 words response.I hope I was not offensive to anyone. I was trying to help you to help us learn better, if that makes sense.M",3
On later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive. In one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right. (Whether it's a situational question or behavioral).,3
"If you are a white man and want to learn how to influence other white men, this is a great course. For the rest of us, this course provides some helpful tips and techniques. Unfortunately, the course instructors ignore the all-too-common psychological biases some people have about others based upon race, gender, age, orientation, etc. And near the end of the course, we watch a white man encourage us to use more emotion -- specifically anger. That is a laughable suggestion. There are ample examples of the fact that the anger of white men can be effective when the anger of others is counterproductive. Here's one: https://asunow.asu.edu/20151027-study-shows-angry-men-gain-influence-and-angry-women-lose-influence",3
"Lots of information, but could be presented in a more learner-friendly manner. Not a lot of information for someone who wishes to learn about organic/holistic dairy management.",3
Average Speakers and material,3
"This course is okay, kind of a bit slow-paced.",3
Despite the material being interesting the instructor's way of teaching it made it boring and hard to pay attention,3
It is cool. but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do.,3
"very useful content, great readings, but total lack of peer-to-peer engagement. It's like reading a book: nice but not up to industry best practices. Overall, the course is lower quality than the ones before from Gregory Northcraft. Another problem with this specific course is word hunting in quizzes. The ones for case studies are especially tricky.",3
"In comparison to other courses, I felt this was a little too superficial for the true challenges of Information Design. Still good though.",3
"The classes were pretty good, but the bibliography was not. The bibliography consists of encyclopedia's articles which are not necessarily written to a beginner. It is quite discouraging for someone starting with philosophy to read articles which lacks a pedagogic approach.",3
Too easy,3
The course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes. And please update the language for SWIFT 3.,3
It's so low that I can do nothing now after learning with every work in this course done.,3
"Great explanation of punctuation rules. However, upgrade costs too much given the amount of materials covered and its complexity.",3
Too basic. Interested to see if the next course will be more challenging.,3
"Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments. For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, ""a screenshot of the complete instructions"". Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run.",3
"This course is good only to give an overview of supply chain logistics, but it does not give little deep to in depth knowledge.",3
doens't address the vegan lifestyle,3
"I gained a solid conceptual understanding of Machine Learning, its terms, problems, and solutions. But I consistently felt unprepared for applying it in Octave.The audio is poor and frustrating, which the course addresses in the first week by essentially saying, ""deal with it"". Also, the instructor has no idea what ""intuition"" means, but uses it incessantly. It's a small nag, but it builds up over 11 weeks.",3
"The modules are rampant with bias against ""big food,"" without considering the science. On the other hand, if you take the course as a whole, then yes, the population would be better off if we all followed the suggestions contained in this course than if we continue on our current path for how we consume food. So the general idea is not without merit. However, I would have expected better from a Stanford faculty member. What is being taught should be just the science, without opinions or biases.",3
javascript part is not covered in depth,3
"The professor is a bit monotone, he needs to be more animated. There are too many assignments , not all can be done while living outside the United States.",3
good introduction to 3D printing,3
"A good course for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about the presented subjects ( like networking, what is embedded software etc. ). Everything is explained in a way your grandmother could understand it.If you are somewhat familiar with them and are looking on information on what IoT exactly is, this course isn't really for you.",3
"The content of the class is very nice. It gives a nice overview on genetics, and it was made accessible to many of us. Also, Mohamed Noor is very enthusiastic, and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course. However, I think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized. For instance, I was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear.",3
"I dont know how the peer reviews are done and like everyone else says its hard to trust them. However, it was a nice course I certainly learnt something that would really help my job.",3
Good course.,3
this course helped me so much in realizing and organizing my time.,3
Course project is difficult for someone who have little idea about the steps in pipelines. Could have included a video that explains few commonly used pipelines and ask the participants to do a project based on it.,3
"Good videos but strucural info and help. Unfortunately , for me it wasn´t very exciting or motivating and perhaps that is because of my own interests.",3
Consider adding a programming assignment to the course curriculum. Please address content issues in a timely manner. Thank you.,3
"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.",3
I wish the course would give me more structured information and examples of applications.,3
"The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animations, etc.) but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course. Barb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resonated with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas. I am contemplating a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done.",3
Very basic and the guy in the video was just reading out things on slides which made it boring,3
A lot of info cramped in long videos makes it confusing sometimes,3
Nice course but lot of troubles are arising during the completion of this course. still i am unable to complete it and could not find out the reason. Once i got a message that my course is completed and i can get my certificate but now it says still assignment pending... i dont know how to deal with it.,3
"the information is outdated, and I have find some examples, services not working anymore. during the course.",3
"It gives a significant coverage of many important command line tools. Teaching level is not good, very difficult to follow.",3
The instruction from the first three weeks does not sufficiently prepare me for the final project.,3
Its a solid java class that has almost 0 android learning. If you are expecting any kind of Android related learning. you will get none this is 100% a java class that just runs in the android environment.,3
I like the course content but the presenter needs to have a more friendly way to present it.,3
"Hoping that the next sections won't be so laborious and focussed on analyzing texts in detail. If you want to know how to do such things, then this would be a 5-star course for you.",3
"Interesting material but the instructor was so monotone and spoke so slowly, I had to play the videos at a faster speed to stay awake. I'll bet it came in handy for those whose English was not as fluent, though.",3
Very interesting but i don't like switching e-learning platforms,3
No good without the missing course and capstone projects,3
"The course was very interesting. It touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail. The lab-based videos were the most interesting. However, the lectures were too long. It would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point.",3
I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent. I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics. The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).,3
"This course took me three months of several hours of work a week to complete. While I definitely learned a lot during that process, it would have been really helpful to have more active instructor engagement and feedback (although I realize that this may not be possible when an official course session is not in progress, which is when the bulk of my work for this course took place).I also think many of the problem statements could have been more clearly defined. For example, I spent a lot of time on the ""Bubble detection"" problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.That being said, I've learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!",3
This course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion. I liked the sample spreadsheets provided. I still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online. The quizzes aren't that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more.,3
Very poorly constructed with links in the final exam that didn't work so I couldn't finish the exam. Then I was graded after only finishing 4/5 of the exam. I managed to get everything straightened out but it took some effort.,3
"Good course, good introduction to Public Relations!!!",3
"The course itself is good, however the assessments need to be worked on",3
"I'm sure this is a fantastic introduction for those with no prior programming experience, but as someone with even just a little bit of prior scripting experience, I found it extremely slow-paced. Rather than suffer through the lectures, I did DataCamp's Intro. to Python and then did all the quizzes & assignments for this class as extra practice.",3
"Good intro course for a total novice. If you have some programming background, you will move through this very quickly.",3
"this course is very useful if you want to learn about something that majority of people(not including me) don't care about, and is based on out-dated info and opinions of a high middle class, house mom. this course is a waste of data. someone get some actual statistics here.",3
This course is a good start to give an overview on the toolbox you should be aware of to specialize in Data science or analysis. You don't need 4 weeks to complete to complete it! At best you could complete within a week or 2 days. Best of luck!,3
"Very basic material, but a good introduction and a necessary step to ensure a baseline of knowledge for future courses in the data science specialization. I would only take this course if you are interested in the specialization otherwise save your money and google the info you need.",3
nice to learn:)),3
"Starts very simplistically. Since I was auditing the class, there was no feedback for quizes of exercises.",3
"Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization. There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience.",3
"The presenter is good and knowledgeable, but the information is barely skimmed over and there isn't any real opportunity to learn. A few worked examples might be good",3
"the course is ok, but the assignment require a lot of prior knowledge on automation control theory, which can be really difficult to be done.I suggest that they should provide extra material for those students who have only computer science background.",3
Needs to be updated. Also correct some errors.,3
so interesting and they got a very talented way of teaching,3
The exercises ae far more advanced than the lectures and study materials.,3
interesting and informative course.,3
I believe this may be a more helpful course to those already quite familiar with statistics and for those who use statistical terminology daily.,3
Pretty basic stuff.,3
"The content of the course is good and I feel it would be beneficial for beginners or those who want to top up their technical / academic knowledge on the subject.I found the terrible editing of the lectures distracting though, and it felt like no one bothered to over-see the final version that was published. I also don't think the fact that one has to pay so much to access the assessments, which many other courses don't do at all, is conducive to creating a strong engagement in the course. I wouldn't for example be encouraged to take another course from this series (not sure if one is offered).",3
Too easy.,3
"The course has some valuable information, however course materials and videos are not so helpful. If you already have some knowledge about statistics and excel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course. Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students.",3
Course content was pretty detailed. I did not like that I had to write down pretty much every single word from each slide and that was said in order to make sure I could answer the quiz questions. Either the quiz questions were bad or it was taught in a confusing manner. I would go with the former.,3
good course a bit hard to understand at times the information can get confusing but the it is there wish they would add printable bulletins at the end so make information readable just for extra help with the understanding of the material,3
progfun and reactive programming was better,3
"the material is too simple. This course is just like a brief introduction, but not a course in college to teach student the real knowledge. I think MOOC course should be the same as a real college course. With the same difficulty and amount of material.",3
"I feel this course is designed in a way that may be too challenging to those who know nothing about music, sound, or biology. The quizzes dont really match the material covered and some of the questions are too ambiguous. The explanations are a little hard to follow as well. It does cover some interesting information about the relationship of music to speech. However, for someone a little more advanced in music and biology, I was hoping for more to be covered. I would have enjoyed more discussion of the history of modes and tuning systems, including more discussion of the Pythagorean comma (and how adjusted need to be made to intervals, especially in a chorus) and Kepler's work. I also would have enjoyed more discussion of rhythmic entrainment, the social cohesion hypothesis of the evolution of music, the roles music plays in human life, the way that bodies synchronize, and more about the relationship of music to emotional regulation, meaning, and personality. Im sure there is more as well. Giving this course 3 stars is generous in my opinion.",3
This course has felt irrelevant in comparison to some of the other courses in this specialisation and this has a very narrow focus which doesn't help. Not all of us are accountants.,3
"A good course that could be better.I think that this course provided a reasonable introduction to Matplotlib, but the lectures need to go a bit deeper and provide more examples. The course left too much of the work to the student. [For your reference, I have a PhD in Mathematics, taught for several years at a highly selective undergraduate college, and have extensive experience in industry as a Matlab and SAS user.] The homework assignments were substantial, and I enjoyed doing the final assignment which required merging two or more datasets using Pandas and then Matplotlib to plot relationships. The course website provides estimates of the number of hours required to complete the assignments, but these were gross underestimates because so much about Matplotlib was left to the student. I would have preferred a bit more lecture time, more examples, and a few side tutorials on using Jupyter and notebooks (how to download and upload), especially since we were grading the code of our fellow students.",3
"The content was very useful. However, a little more detail could have been provided while explaining a few concepts. I am confident of using these frameworks in the future. However, before applying them I will have to visit the material again. Thank you so much.",3
"Unlike the previous courses within this Digital Marketing Specialization, this one seemed more ""superficial"" in terms of concepts and, specially, of materials provided: presentation videos and slides covered only the essential topics and were often repetitive. Considering this is the last step to the Capstone Project, I had greater expectations for it.",3
"This is a great introductory course for the Health of Transgendered youths. Many intersections such as, socio-economic factors, race, geography, or access issues are not addressed which heavily impact this community and possible families that are disenfranchised by these disparities.",3
Worse than Scala Principles - too chaotic.,3
"While I appreciate the logic behind this class, the content seemed very subjective and loose compared ot the class prior.",3
No practical at least till the end of this course in this specialization,3
"Despite being a very interesting topic, I did not find this course as enjoyable as others I have done. Maybe covering these many amount of things in such a short course is too challenging. Anyhow, if you want to learn about India, it is a good course. However, I would recommend the one from The Ohio State University ('The importance of India"")",3
Course was helpful but final test was poorly worded and very confusing.,3
"Helpful, but the teacher is annoying and condesending.",3
"The course material is very good. The most obvious issue with the course, is that peer revision takes a very long time, which means that you will get overdue assignments no matter what. For instance, after three weeks I'm still waiting for a revision that I wanted to use for the final workshop. I assume that instructor involvement in project revision is impossible in this kind of online course; but perhaps, if the issue is that people aren't getting their work reviewed, there could be an incentive for reviewers, for example, get an instructor/mentor review, if you submit at least, say, 10 thorough peer reviews.",3
Takes a long time to figure out the problem sets,3
Good for Beginners to go for.,3
"There are no lectures on Services, and Content Providers which are two key components of the Android system. It really disappointed me.",3
"I audited this course. The videos are in fact useful. However, it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course. Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract. Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application.",3
Very interesting course - Thank you.,3
"This was a very wordy course. Some times it felt like they just kept repeating and rambling, but I did learn the proper documentation for big games.",3
This course didn't teach me much about Data Science or the different areas to pursue after this introductory course. I probably could have got as much out of it as following the tutorials on GitHub and the new desktop tool. Following the tutorial which was made for windows was also a bit annoying at times. Finally I had to wait weeks to have my assignment marked and there is still conflicting information on the course page - in 'grades' it shows I didn't pass the week 4 task. On other pages it shows I did and earned 41 out of 41 points. However I can't see a confirmation of course completion.,3
A bit disorganized and rambling lectures. Good content,3
Interesting but too simple.,3
Good content but extremely basic,3
"she can go in depth more and give us more and more information. but still, i like it.thank you coursera",3
"The course is well structured and remains focused on the topic on hand. It is easy to follow Kevins thought, but the discussion is quite superficial; no concrete numbers and examples are worked through in the discussion. It would have strengthened the course if the discussion went step-by-step through a balance sheet of one of the companies featured in the course.",3
"This course is really, well, introductory. While the material presented is interesting, the lectures can be quite dull at times - especially later on in the course when substantial time is spent plugging numbers into the same expressions 3 or 4 times. Beginners will probably be better off reading a wikipedia article or any general chemistry textbook. For the others, setting the playback speed to 1.50 improves the quality of the course a lot.",3
Informative,3
It is alright but several people take advantage of the lax review criteria to submit one letter reviews. Better grading system would be good. Material is all fine.,3
It's nice course but a little bit boring.,3
"Some interesting stuff in there.A couple of lectures need video editing though. (There is one where the lecturer says ""Let me start over"" and then starts over. The less than optimal start could be trimmed off.)",3
"The professor, Michael Scharf, seems to have a heavy bias to ""justice"" (as in punishment) and that leaves me with a poor taste as I listen to his content. I found an error in content that bothered me but did not interfere with the main points of the course. Overall I'm happy with the understanding of International Criminal Law that I have gained, though I am displeased with the biases I found in the professor.",3
Too basic and too easy but helpful content,3
"I believe that exaggerated the amount of minutes per video and lack of theory, but it was still a good course.",3
"Didn't really elevate my writing. Mostly due to the fact that there were no practical exercises included. Though some of the theoretical stuff that is covered is sort of common sense, most is still very relevant, so I don't regret taking the course.",3
"Things are way to deep for not programmers, i did not enjoyed so much as the previous",3
"The course is interesting, and packed with some easy to understand, easy to apply techniques. On the other hand, the real theory behind why these techniques work is deliberately omitted from the videos. This creates the feeling of a bit of esoteric knowledge, or, what it is worse, a feeling of trial and error techniques, like the ones anybody can develop on his own... Also the total lack of exercises makes it a little bit boring to follow at times. Overall, a good experience.Quick note of speaking speed: I understand that reading slowly is best sometimes, but Prof. Oakley is EXTREMELY slow, so much so, that I watched the videos at 1.25x and still felt like she was speaking at slightly slower speed than a normal person..",3
"Very good for those who start, inspirational for whoever. Thanks. Blaho",3
"Somewhat useful, but suffers from what seems to be bad planning and a general lack of focus.",3
more excercises should be added to the course,3
Was expecting more videos than readings.,3
I found the initial videos very informaive. Then it suddenly chnged the order and I didnt find a conclusive end,3
Learned a bit but overall it is literally not worth the price of admission. I think that this course could be offered for free and maybe the others are worth paying for. Hope that the rest of the specialization is worthwhile,3
"Awesome, straight to the point and full of great new ideas, I just wish it was longer",3
It could be better.,3
Course was poorly put together with errors that are not fixed.,3
Good Attractiveness,3
"We were introduced to Bootstrap, but not taught much about how to use it and how to structure our html for it.",3
I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.,3
"Long, slow, rambling video. I watched most of it at 1.75x. Slides are kind of a mess and lectures are disorganized.",3
"They just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises. This situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe. It is like, ""Okay now we have learned that 1+2=3. Let's talk about calculus.""",3
"This course sets the stage for the rest of the Data Science specialisation.You get a lot of textbooks for free and they cover a lot of material.The quizzes are a little bit underwhelming, especially the first week. Too few questions, testing some questionable knowledge (eg, what other courses there are in the specialisation -- hardly a required tool in the data scientist's box).Overall, it's a good preparation for what is to come. It managed to whet my appetite for more , however I'm not sure the course is very useful on its own.",3
"A good introduction for ""beginners"", aka people who are not involved, educated or interested in public health, healthcare. Alternatively, seek another course because it is very simple.",3
"Great topic, but the course was less interesting and profound than I expected. The professor could be a little more motivating. Worth the time though!",3
"Very interesting course, both tests and assignments aredemanding but fair.Biggest problem of this course is that not all required topics are coveredenough in lectures.",3
"The biggest downside of the course is that instead of learning on open source machine learning modules (sklearn) the course offers Dato's GraphLab, a proprietary piece of software that requires paid licenses to operate.To be clear, during the duration of the course students can use a student license that provides graphlab for free but this expires after a year. It seems like fine software but if you arent going to purchase a license after the class expires whats the point? Also, Graphlab is built on top of python2.7. If you are running python 3.0+ on your machine youll have to install a python 2.7 instance.Otherwise the quality is solid. The philosophical approach the professors take is to give you a taste of a variety of machine learning models. The upside is that if you want to get a taste you can. The downside the course feels pretty shallow and then the next course in the specialization -- regression -- feels like a pretty stark contrast. In general it could be argued that this is a problem with all coursera courses. How do you modulate course difficulty when you could be targeting students who are somewhere between high school kids to computer scientists? So the course and the specialization tilts between very easy and very hard.",3
Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good.,3
"Nice primer for modeling, but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home.",3
I am glad that this exist but notice many errors. Every chapter has at least one error. Wish the admin address these issues through the discussion forums.,3
"It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof. While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.",3
"There are a number of issues with this course, and more generally Coursera. While the course does cover the material, it uses non-standard mathematical notation. This can be very confusing and seems as if it is purposefully so. There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently. It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited. A colleague once took a course online (through another platform). Some of the course material was objectively wrong. However, there was no ability to submit feedback. I have the sense that this could easily happen with the Coursera material. It totally undercuts the apparent validity of the platform.",3
"The course is all comprehensive about models and concepts of communication science, however the break-down into small lectures turn out to be too brief in my opinion to develop rich understanding of the subject. It would be more conducive that lecturer expands more on the cutting edge study and research, to give people a sense of the finding of the field and its benefits.",3
Solid introduction - slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation.,3
"It is a good introductory course, but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field, as it is very basic.",3
It was a fast and easy course. I thought it could use more insight from other instructors. The links to other videos were useful on the text documents that were available to read.,3
Later courses are better. This one is quite easy.,3
This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.,3
"Hi team, I just had one feedback on the course content that there were some princip",3
"Introduced me to some cool ideas, web services and ideas for basic web design but isn't really a beginner course. I've switched over to a similar course from University of London.The lecturers in this course were very stiff and scripted and not overly simplistic in their explanations- something essential to avoid frustrating those of us just starting out. If you want a course that teaches you the basics from the true beginning but doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot for not understanding try Responsive Website Basics from the U of London & Goldsmiths.",3
I like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming,3
"A very nice warming session that stirs awareness into food, nutrition and health.",3
Nice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignments.Hope quizzes were better in standard.,3
"It's a good course with a lot of information. Some of it will be useful going forward, if I can remember it all!However, it's almost too much information for one course, I think it should be 2-3 courses.",3
"All in all I liked the course, it's easy to comprehend and well structured. Nevertheless, I missed the lecurer, I'd really liked that the lectured didn't read the script but retold it in the camera, it would be more of a face to face communication. Besides, some interviews would be nice.",3
"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Dr Chuck! :-)",3
"The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism: it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today.Being a basic course, it is very easy to follow and finish. Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad. Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing, but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn't make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating.The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology, especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors ""spark white"", and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it, which was downright infuriating.It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism, but needs serious improvement.",3
"This course seems great, although plenty of errors in the audio transcript. The steepness of the learning curve increased very quickly and understandability decreased after week 3, which made me drop the course. I hope to be able to retake it some time in the future with the right mathematical skills.",3
"Very good course especially for math/cs students - a lot of focus is put on explaining the math behind algorithms and equations, so if you search for practical examples and use cases, maybe try to look for another course",3
i think i need more time to finish this curse,3
"Poor delivery, very hard to listen. Lector uses too many buzz words like ""em"", ""am"". This is not a live lecture so it could be worth practicing and recording a clean quality speech. For example, lectures from the week 2 are unbearable to listen.",3
"Great teacher, although I would rather need more examples of elaborate emails, that I could use at work.Thank you!",3
Too much reading material and too few videos.,3
It's a good course but not great. Something is missing and I can't pinpoint what.,3
"This course is mis-titled. There is very little music involved and a lot of social action. The discussions and videos are interesting, buy I am confused about the use of ""music"" to carry the course's agenda. Perhaps ""The Influence of the Arts on Social Action"" would better define the intent of the course.",3
"This is an ok introductory course, a compilation of concepts, related to sustainable cities. Mentiones a list of places where one or another practice is implemented. Some educational clips look like they are taken from Youtube or like promo videos for a certain initiative. Some of the ""lecturers"" are just phd students, introducing their research topics. No step-by-step examples of developed cases are shown.",3
"It was a bit fast and some things were not well explained but other than that a great course, love courseera already!",3
More matter should be covered in this course.,3
Among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons. Regards.,3
"The content of the course is very nice. Especially the part about the instruments is very good. It's good to see exact instruments of them. Hovewer, I think, a course about music should include a little bit music :) It will be better to figure out the problem about copyright. I prepared a Spotify list that includes the songs mentioned during the course but It's better to listen the music or see the lyrics during the course.Thank you very much :)",3
"The content was pretty good, but I'm annoyed that I paid for a disjointed collection of videos that were previously available for free. This is just a pared down (worse) version of an older class, ""Principles of Reactive Programming"", which I started but didn't finish three years ago. The videos and assignments are the same, but some of them have been removed, so there are confusing discontinuities. Some of the videos refer to a ""next lecture"" or ""previous lecture"", which isn't included in this class. The last week of the class should have been split across multiple weeks, and I'm disappointed I never got to do an assignment on latency or futures.That being said, I'd still recommend taking any class taught by Odersky, and I learned a fair amount.",3
"In general this was an easy, interesting and enjoyable course, Video interviews and lectures by key researchers in this exciting field were a highlight. It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me.One was a feeling of unqualified evangelism. I think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field, but the level of hype here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting. This is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them. Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American Gut Project. Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful. I resent being duped into watching ads when I've signed up to be educated.The other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless, time-consuming projects. I didn't learn anything from these projects and found them annoying.",3
"well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone. Why did Coursera split it to another course?",3
Just wish to have some concept check before taking the quiz.,3
"It's more statistics than Excel itself, wich is good but I think the name doesn't fit to it",3
Peer reviewed assessment with students who are unsure of the correct answers = unsure if solution is correct. Perhaps a formal process (same as previous course where a SHA commit is submitted and source is automatically downloaded (and plagiarism detected) & run to verify the output that columns / data meet an acceptable criteria,3
The course should have more details. It feels like a lot was skipped.,3
A very well-done introduction to Design Thinking,3
I did not enjoy this as much as the first course. Still interesting though!,3
very easy,3
Most of the information in the course are available online but still this course will help you align and organize your diet and exercise,3
Would have liked an exercise between lessons. Would have liked clearer instructions for final assignment.,3
More on the history of SEO rather than tactics.,3
"Teaches the history well, but doesn't focus much on helping to improve.",3
First week and last week were pretty useful with some good tips from the videos... the other weeks not so much.,3
Its a really a nice course.,3
The landscape is quite basic and would require further development to be more relevant,3
"Beautifully executed and fun to hear Michael Pollen speak, but sooooo easy. Too easy, really.",3
A little light on the theory,3
"Review comments:What I learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in Week 4.[Parallel Structure]It uses some conjunctions like and, but, both....and..., not only...but also...[Sentence Variety]Use the different 4 types English sentence style, simple, compound, complex and compound-complex to enrich your writing. In addition, adverbs, prepositional phrases (like in the morning), other transitions (furthermore) could be used to create variety. At last, combining the short sentences, medium sentences (10-15 words) and long ones (20-40 words) will also make your writing alive. Some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns, using synonyms, saying things in different ways.- Use different sentence types- Start sentence differently- Use different sentence lengths- Use synonyms effectivelyConsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay, so do not do it in the begining.",3
"Some good material and I good introduction to aerial robotics. But, it doesn't cover all the theory needed to actually write flight control software for a quad copter. If you are really new to robotics you will need to spend at least 40-50 hours a week ""discovering"" enough of the details to pass the course.",3
"Interesting subject matter, but offered in an insufficient way. Bad transcripts, for example: AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD BE SERIOUS FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNIST, THAT MEANS YOU – am I a global communist? And quizzes with questions that cannot be answered from the course texts. There are far better courses on this subject, from the University of Alberta (Coursera) or the University of British Columbia (edX).",3
The course is good! But a little bit more on social media. It will be better if we can learn more about tactics and methods of personal branding.,3
very basic,3
"For some of the topics, the Introduction class has more meaningful homework projects. this felt a bit thin.",3
The course is too very basic and is very slow. I am not from a programming background and still feel so.,3
Very basic introduction and not thorough or mathematical enough.,3
"Huge gap between theory and programming assignments, however quizzes are interesting and require some time to complete.",3
"The material in the class is solid, but is poorly described. These are the foundations of statistical analysis, and unfortunately there's a lot of statistics jargon that students aren't going to be familiar with in here.",3
very short course.,3
"I have to admit that the professors know the topic and are conducting amazing research, but the course was dry and terribly designed. The videos are too long, without quizzes or activities to break the long dry monologues. They also talk like robots and one gets lost really fast. I have taken many courses in coursera with long and short videos, with boring and engaging teachers but this is by far the worse. They are trying to show off so much information and in such a high level language (to most), that it makes it incredibly boring. I should add that I have studied Buddhism, and there are so many better ways to provide people an opportunity to come into contact with this beautiful topic.",3
The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures. This was a little unfair. It may be the way to teach for in-person learning but it is frustrating for an online course. Others have commented on the rapid pace. I would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested.,3
"Lots of talking head videos without enough visual aids to solidify the adult learning process. Not very ""Executive level"" as the course title and description imply. I would expect more ""TED Talk"" level lectures and materials, with plenty of real-world examples. Content in these courses seem more ""new manager / new supervisor"" level, if not actually geared toward an undergrad audience.",3
"Some irritating errors, but overall it was okay.",3
Not really in debt treatment of the subject. Lacks realistic applications.,3
Videos from previuos version of the course Reactive programming in Scala makes this course worse prepared. I had impression that it was made rushed from shredded pieces. Assignements are easier than previous,3
"He talks to0o00o fast and His slides are too wordy and I feel so sleepy When I was watching these videos! (I don't know why)!However As a PhD biomedical Eng, I'm learning alot from this specialization and I highly appreciate them for creating such amazing Idea. I'm Canadian and I know we have lots of similarities with you and I think I should make it for Canada and our university.Sincerely,Azadeh",3
"Good information. When you compare this course to others available on Coursera, such as UVA Darden's Design Thinking or University of Maryland courses on Entrepreneurship, this course does not have the same level of information, nor was the same care put into completing the course materials. For instance, the last three or so classes were missing, yet it was still possible to take and pass the final review.",3
"This was a decent class to get started on programming a Raspberry Pi and hooking it up to a web service. The material was easy to follow and the instructions were precise. With this class, you'll be in a position to create interesting applications using the Raspberry PiThere were two negatives to this class:1) Most of the assignments used the Node Red environment. This is a visual programming tool. Although it's easy to use, I would have preferred programming using a more widely used and more powerful environment.2) The auto grader for the class was not very robust and did a poor job of giving feedback on why things weren't passing. Several times, the assignment would pass in my environment but fail in the auto grader due to (incorrect) assumptions that the auto grader was making about implementation.Overall, this was a worthwhile course but could use some improvement.",3
It helped me to recollect the some areas of Exc,3
Basic Course.,3
This course is really good for Ruby beginners but it doesn't provide enough basic information on Rails framework. The lectures are clear and of a good quality as well as course assignments. The one think I really didn't like is that if you use a new version of Rails you'll have to downgrade. It's not a big problem but new versions bring new functionality and give more power to the developer. But if you don't know Ruby and Rails at all this is a good place to start.,3
i dont want to know the history of language and the pendulum swing i just want a list short and simple in a single 20 min video and move one. this was so boring,3
"It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I wish the course had more in-depth discussion of topics and more technical material.",3
Good course,3
"The course is challenging and the exams use real-world data.The sequence of the course is not linear, the exams are too difficult compared to the material covered in classes.",3
"This is a good course, but be sure you have a foundational level of understanding of Macroeconomics before starting - it doesn't provide a lot of background before diving into more advanced topics.",3
"Good as just an introduction to data science. Some more exercises using Github, maybe some collaborative works would have been nice.",3
"Thanks so much for a solid course that covers all the main pillars for understanding the structure and philosophy of the Union. Particularly important in those time of crises in which, the raise of populism and far right political agenda is being used as a tool to assign responsibility to the EU to failures at national level. Lack of transparency and accountability in addition to a lack of leadership is the real responsible of this crisis of credibility.Is for this reason that its essential to educate people around the meaning of the EU and this course fully achieves this goal. Only one point to take it into account that is regarding the feedback from peers. In my case were not quite useful, without almost no analysis and without understanding the meaning of the assignment in itself. It´d be good to further consider this aspect and/or see other alternatives like the intervention of the facilitator.",3
Lot of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work.,3
"This course was significantly less instructive than the first. Assignments did not lead me as constructively through the material. Also the few videos with the other lecturer in week 4 are very confusing, hard to understand, or even appreciate in light of all the other material. I do not think that I have understood futures and am glad it was not required for the last assignment as the answers aren't present in the material.",3
Content is too easy,3
"The course has intrinsic value, but as the complexity of the materials covered, the weekly slides were a priority to allow students to grasp better the materials covered. Just relying in the videos to assimilate the content is not an effective form of learning. Also pausing the videos to watch the definitions in most cases was ineffective as it was hard to see it properly. Please consider to release the lecture slides to all courses. If the slides were available, that would helped me to go further in my learning proccess. That's why I only give a 3/5. The slides are determinant to improve and master (to some extent) the materials covered.",3
"Contents in first half weeks are very superficial, have low depth so that do not help me do some meaningful studies. But later ones are good for understanding the structure of data.",3
"Pretty simple, the Univ of Michigan Data Science with Python set the bar pretty high.",3
"I suggest including more practical examples in the videos in order to further understand the theory. Also, some concepts are mentioned but not explained.",3
"The videos are poorly done, and it's hard to follow with practicing in a Playground at the same time. Also, some of the optional material, is required for completing the assessment, which a bit unfair. The material covered in the videos is too basic to be able to apply the principles to a larger programme.",3
I've missed at least one practical exercises on each module.Overall is good.,3
"The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized. There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments. On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class. If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class. Despite it's faults though I would still recommend it as I did learn a fair amount of HTML, CSS and JS quickly. I look forward to additional classes from this university. Thank you for your efforts.",3
"I really struggled - coming from a zero programming background. I recommend tons of reading, practical exercises, swirl is a bit of a savior and so is stackoverflow. Even with all of that, I struggled to get my mind to think like a programmer and structure the thoughts into plans for the assignments and tests. I think there needs to be a course before this that teaches one what the first step of solving a programming-related problem; eg one that focuses on flow charts, breaking down the question, etc... It literally is like learning a new language : you need to keep reading and practicing and watching/listening to others do it until you start to get it.",3
"Overall it is OK, but the example framework is more like created for teach purpose which is not practical in industry. Moreover, it seems there are many incorrect part in the assignment especially optional code assignments.",3
"Not much content for this course, can be done in a few hours.",3
Getting more theoretical and less practical application on Excel application. Advanced Data interpretation and solving methods information can be included.,3
Not really clear step up from the scratch to android/java programming,3
"It was quick, but I was expecting some more views and videos of other professionals to get the additional learning.",3
Fun course but everything was already covered on the Fundamentals Of Graphic Design Course.,3
"The audio can be difficult to understand. Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor. If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff.",3
Doesn't provide a strong enough base for R Programming.,3
Wished the course was a deeper dive into this area.,3
"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically.Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",3
"expected more programs to be taught and more experiments to be shown, disappointing",3
Not for those with no background in advanced engineering math. Expect to pick up independently most of the things that are being taught.,3
"Need very strong skills and experience in Python. Also, some basic knowledge in ML also is necessary.",3
It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas. I still confused with probability.Also hadwritting isnt really helping. I am most of the time decoding scripts. In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen. So I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen. horrible experience.,3
"Very highlever, i would have enjoyed more technique to understand art",3
It was really basic (but 4 weeks - it`s really short period of time for such topic). I think HTML5 and CSS3 courses were better.,3
"The course in general is not as good as Martin Odersky's first course, but it still has interesting bits to learn about functional programming.Everything topic feels very disconnected to each other.Lastly, the last part of the course is specially disorganized. I didn't feel like the assignment captured everthing that was taught.",3
"the lectures are pretty great, engaging. the assignments stick with the lab exercise. the forum pretty active.",3
Good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve.,3
"Some parts were good but overall the course was lacking in its ability to add value. There were generic discussions. Week 3 was almost useless; had it not been for a good reading provided for an assignment, it was too basic.Add some specificity in the course or name it Basics of Research Methods.",3
"I am giving this course 3 stars for a few reasons:1) (Negative) Essentially no instructions were given for how to get Graphlab to actually work in Python outside of the notebook. I already have python on my computer, but the course basically only explains ipython notebook.2) (Negative) I think the course would be a lot better if it didn't use this pretty graphical interface of ipython notebook. Why use this? I feel like this was done to dumb things down so that more people with no programming knowledge could get by. In reality it just makes everyone learn less. Using python normally, with graphlab imported, would be much better.3) (Positive) The lectures on things other than ipython notebook were fairly good, and I like how the specialty is structured with case studies.",3
Good course for beginers,3
"Super basic, each week was only about 30 minutes of video lecture... but I think that was their goal? Bad form on coursera for making you pay to submit assignments that are autograded to begin with.",3
"This course is good, but I feel it's too difficult. It would be good to suggest 'optional' prerequisite course if there is any. Thanks Dr. Egger.",3
"This course in informative, but not very, and it is rather boring.",3
Very basic. The structure is odd; the last week contains more material than the rest of the course put together.,3
Lecture videos are good. Assessment of knowledge (quizzes) are weak.,3
"Course is too simple, should be more extensive.",3
This course was disappointing compared to the first course in the series (Introduction to Data Science). If you enjoy reading academic papers and peer reviews then this course is for you. If you don't then just search the web for tutorials on Matplotlib and Seaborn.,3
"I think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students. If there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more, it will be a very good learning experience to all.",3
Worth skimming fast through for free to learn a little something about the brain. Don't expect to learn much about the brain though. The title is a little misleading.,3
"This course is very useful and interesting, but the materials of week 2 & 4 is enough for their quizs.",3
"The lecture material was high level, and didn't seem to be a good preparation for the quizzes.The description for the final project was not very detailed, and the grading rubric likewise was not very specific for peer review.",3
"I enjoyed the lectures, but I felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data. The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course (e.g. the final exam file not being available) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course. A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis. Fantastic course mentor/TA.",3
Lacks the hands on learning experience i was looking for but a great overview.,3
Some topics were explained in a shallow manner. I suggest providing detailed lecture notes besides the videos for students trying to understand math and physics behind the concepts introduced in videos,3
So many valuable information in this course.But professor can surely present it in better way.,3
Just showing examples of some good projects and their code at most part of the course .Also comparing Meteor with Wordpress is wrong and I don't think Meteor will reach Wordpress.After all they are different tools for different jobs.,3
"Some parts were very useful. Some parts looked useful, but when I tried it in practice, it was almost impossible to do for me. The course wants to make you behave like a machine, for a part of your job. So you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to. But behaving like a machine, I tried, but I can not. Still there are very usefull parts in this course. I did about 4/5 of the course.",3
too easy,3
"The material is interesting, however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each week's assignments. It relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources, and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manner.Additionally, there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of 3 hours.Overall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week. This may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in 7-10 weeks down into 4 weeks. If the intention is to give a ""flavor"" in 4 weeks, then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format.",3
"This course was very scattered and included several different lecturers. It was the least focused course in the specialization, but still did provide insight in an area I probably knew the least about.",3
Very basic overview of the topic. Did not meet my expectations.,3
Same as the theory class not much examples or case studies....,3
"I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching. It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long. After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification. Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course. I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^",3
"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you.The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.",3
"just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials. Pretty boring.",3
"Very well done (3 stars so I know I have completed the lectures but not the work, will change after completing assignments)",3
Good and necessary introduction to Python. But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved. It´s good to know how to clean the data but it´s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it´s not. Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.,3
not as clear as the previous courses,3
For a beginner like me its totally going over the head. I mean i get the logic but if you guys can please give more code...I am learning data structures for the first time and it is bit difficult for me to grasp it all and write codes in a week...,3
"The course is awsome to get motivation and quite informative. However it teaches lot of practical concepts using Tableau which is a commercial software.Since these concepts entirely new to me. It take me a lot of time to understand videos and still I'm afraid I'll forget the things as soon as I leave it. I think some more practical activities should be introduce (on free platforms), to make knowledge more sustainable.",3
"More like a 3.5 to 4? Close to 4. The main problem for me with this course was the assignment. I found it a bit unclear. The instructions are clear, but the way to go about completing the assignment was not. The last assignment we had in Course 3 was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important. We were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course. In this course, that aspect was a bit lacking",3
"This is a good course to get you thinking about your future classroom. However, do not expect it to necessarily challenge you to think in depth about your practice or provide engaging discussion via the forums.Nevertheless, a good way to get you thinking critically about how you want to run your classroom and provide examples and suggestions.",3
"The content is really good, well explained=> 5 stars, nothing to add.Why the 3 stars then ? Graphlab. If you use the pydata stack, as it is said to be possible in every assignments, you get stuck on the quizz due to variations on data and the algorithm used, so you can't really get quite the same answers.",3
"The topics are all very basic and the audio/video is sub-par, but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic, such as David Allen's GTD.Applying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance one's own productivity both at work and in the private life.",3
"Certain aspects of the course could be improved, particularly in the way the material is presented. There could also be more focus on what is important rather than unnecessary etymologies and listing of names which doesn't add to any conceptual understanding. That time could rather be used to go into more depth with some of the practices.https://evidenceandreason.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/review-magic-in-the-middle-ages/",3
A good course that lacked practical information on performing a meta-analysis.,3
"Overall this course has covered a lot of good and interesting information! I found the presentation to be lacking somewhat as the course-leaders were reading off the info in front of the camera, which gave the lectures an artificial sort of feel. I did enjoy the different interviews along the way, which spiced things up a bit. The grading of this course needs to be revised, in my view, as some things will go amiss when students grade each other. All in all it's clear that a lot of work has gone into this course, and that is definitely to be commended by all involved.",3
"Pros:(1) Teachers know what they are talking.(2) They are energetic and funny.Cons:(1) The course uses proprietary and expensive tool.(2) The course is too simplistic.(3) The teachers, although they know what they are talking about, they aren't very good at teaching.",3
"It is a bit ambiguous the way it teaches a way to apply accountability, sometimes it is sometimes is not, it all depend on the circunstances.I recommend try to focus in the fundamentalsonly.",3
Assignments were just not that challenging except first one,3
"Great materials, great learning system! I could get some inspiration and learning, but i thought it was to short.",3
"Just a format introduction to Project management, but good one.",3
too redundant,3
Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you. There is a lot of space to improve this course.,3
"The course was very limited, it should have been combined with Introduction to R.",3
"This was a decent course. Some informative, big picture information but I felt that it lacked some hands on understanding. The minor hands on labs that were provided, were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with Python script writing. I would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course.",3
The course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts.,3
"somehow I feel the course materials were not prepared well also it was not effective presentation, it was more like a reading a presentation",3
A good introduction to the course. Opening up quizzes to help feedback what we'd learned (for free learners) would have made the course much better!,3
i expected it to be more advanced.,3
"Found it a bit hard to follow, some aspects could've been explained in more detail.",3
you cant do the final thing unless you pay so That minuses 2 stars.,3
Good course. Somewhat odd levels of difficulty. Like the weekly lessons are easy and then the wall goes up in the task at week 5.,3
The videos were a bit confusing and gave me the impression that it was a patchwork from old lectures.,3
It was good but according to me it had a paucity of arduino programming for which i enrolled . However it was still helpful and i enjoyed it .,3
"Pros: Really motivating!Cons: Not much real content even for a beginner, too short.",3
It have low practice exercises.,3
"This was an excellent course, but rather brief. The information was easy to absorb. There is a lot of value to taking the course.",3
"To me , you were preaching to the choir. I have been trying to follow Pollan's ideas for years. I was hoping for new information, but for me it was a rehash of stuff I have heard ad infinite. this did not seem like a class. This seemed more like an advertisement for healthy eating with it constant music and sparse content. Certainly it did not have the rigorous content that would have been required in a college level credited class. It was certainly not as interesting nor as informative as the Berkeley class ""edible education 101""Still as an advertisement for good eating it was well done. If you found an audience out there somewhere who had not heard these messages, then you have succeeded and I applaud you for that.",3
"Some of the SCRUM, XP & Agile Practices can be better explained. I have expected a few more things here.",3
Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.,3
"After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric. Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course.",3
I wish there several comprehensive examples of exploring some real data as guided by the course instructors.,3
"The course is structured in an efficient way. However, it does not offer an unbiased opinion about EU as can be seen from the title of the course. There are many things that can be improved in EU and a more critical approach would be a lot more helpful. Overall, this course has an above average quality with an acceptable level of engagement.",3
Thought this course could've been much more effective. The content felt very random and esoteric at times. Especially the programming assignment on cached results. I get it. I'm a programmer at heart. But this is at the margin of usefulness. How about a segment on running regressions? Or doing some real data analysis?,3
"The course way OK, but it had some flaws.It was very general and could have gone into more detail, but that was intentional, I guess. No big deal. Then again, the difficulty was way too easy and the quiz questions should be tested for test wiseness. What I disliked the most: The way Scrum was introduced and mapped to the role of a ""product manager"" was very confusing.Still, not a bad course though.",3
"The course lecture was ok, Swirl was pretty good. The assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.",3
Fairly good. Fundamental knowledge for researcher.,3
"Very thorough. Walks you step by step, but a little too slow and detailed for someone with minimal coding background.",3
"Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,",3
The concepts and knowledge this course covers are useful and practical. The length of the videos is the only thing I dislike. Sometimes they are too long.,3
"The lectures are amazing, but I wish we have a lot more involved homework than the short quizzes. If there were more research questions or problem solving homeworks that demonstrate deeply the understanding of the subjects that would have been great. The current quizzes are very trivial and doesn't test the understanding of the material only the fact that you actually went through the lectures even if quickly.",3
Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
"I didn't like how there was no interaction with the other classmates or there was no easy way to comment, but I loved the way it was so interactive",3
The coding assignment instructions are near impossible to follow. The lecture is monotonous in the later weeks.,3
"So first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structured, with good sources. My concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes + graded assignment in the last week. The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.g. plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data. I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz (programming assignment for instance).I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better.",3
"Very basic, the quizzes aren't clear enough",3
"Maybe if you're just starting out and using the same software as Prince Charles, this class would be more useful. Even so, the audio on this has got to be fixed, especially since this is an audio class about mixing!I learned a few vocal layering techniques, but this is a really beginner class and is very DAW-specific; if you aren't using the specific software, the information here will only be valuable for topical concepts. Because if this, watching the videos aren't much help visually, but then it's an uneasy listen because the audio levels in the videos are so uneven, that you can barely hear the professor's voice on a common speaker, and then you get BLASTED when he turns on an audio clip.The way he explained things also felt a bit slow and dragging to me. I teach young children, and it seemed reminiscent of the way I have to talk to them sometimes. Then there's this really awkward and long interview with his musical colleague (week 4) who didn't seem to know much about what he was being asked, and while watching their conversation, it's totally apparent in the professor's face that he wasn't getting the output he wanted from the guy.Thanks for the vocal techniques. I hope this feedback is helpful.",3
Instructors tend to talk too fast and read off the slides verbatim instead of thoroughly explaining the topic,3
Video Orientation is not proper.,3
Very basic introduction...,3
"On a whole I am satisfied with he expanse of the course curriculum. However, I wished it covered certain in greater depth such as the Quantitative methods of Marketing Research. Also certain parts of the Consumer Behaviour section were quite repetitive.",3
"A little dated, with most material and research presented from the glorious days of 2012. The issues at hand are however still valid, though",3
"The teacher spoke very clearly, but the transcripts of each lecture should have included the Pinyin transcriptions. Without them,they were no help.",3
"Only average. Much is said, little information delivered.",3
The teacher speaks very fast and provides the material not deep!,3
the professor was a little bit dry and repetitive but otherwise the content was interesting!,3
"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!",3
"Very basic, very clear.",3
"I found the course was unfortunately slightly dry - I was expecting more from the videos. The speakers know their information and showcase the different types of power and influence you can exert on people and they can exert on you, however, I believe it could have had more real world examples.",3
"This was a valuable introductory survey course. For me, the challenge came from my unfamiliarity with Python not the material. I would rate this class as ""entry level"" for anybody with a college-level technical degree.",3
It was inspiring though,3
"Gread course, shows the basic of IOT.",3
A broad collection of different subjects. But only a part of it met my interests.,3
"The course material is good, and Casey always gives further reads and references. I specially liked to have book references and I started to read one of those.I found however a disconnection between the idea of using the MDA/DPE framework described in the course, and the actual projects which were more into creating the set of documents used in game design to collect the details, create a better picture, and think better about the game. In some way, the iterative process of coming back to the idea, from document to document, helped to refine the game, but it happened more as something natural.I wished we would have had some sort of checklist to evaluate and apply during the design process the framework.As feedback to the instructor, I think he needs to stop using the ending word ""right?"" to finish his sentences. At some point, of the course it became really difficult to follow, right?. right?. right? ... ufff ...Also, I believe he knows a lot, but a bit of preparation and flow in his lectures would be appreciated. Maybe the use of some sort of autoclue, would help.Last, but this could be more for the course editors, the instructor has good slides and material, but usually during the lectures the slides disappear (just in the moment one need to focus his attention in the written material) and the instructor appears in first plane. I think you could keep the instructor in a PIP box all the time, and perhaps put him in first plane only at the beginning and end.",3
Got really bonkers listening to the University of London jingle at the start AND end of each of the 38 video's in this course. The content is just ok.. but not explanation is very high level. It is good for someone who has never had experience with web technologies before.,3
"I liked the course very much, but it is brief. I think it will help us more if some topics are explained in detail.",3
"I learned some important concepts, but all of the material was repeated many times. If the redundancy of information were eliminated, imagine how much more students of this course could learn!",3
Very high level.,3
"Too expensive for the material it provides; it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in 1-2 lectures. There is a very good lecture from an external speaker,which was very good and funny (at least i found it funny) and i didn't realise that it was 30 mins long.",3
"It is a good course, however, I would have liked deeper knowledge in git",3
"Nice but quite simple. And I missed the teaching of good pythonic programming style (something that is more than just script step by step but encapsulate functionality in functions, use advanced programming techniques, test your code and so on).",3
There were and still are some typos in tests.,3
There is a large gap between the course material and the assignments. Requires A LOT of extra research to complete if you do not have prior R experience.,3
"too basic for me, excellent for programming newbies",3
"Too basic, not very informative. Waste of money.",3
"The course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what I anticipated)",3
"I worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes. If I could not answer one question correctly, it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that I could not pass quiz. With no recourse, I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing. I would still like to pass, as I feel that I really earned the certificate. I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions. My other problem was using one of the models, which I never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.",3
"If you are a beginner, this course's assignments will be quite difficult to solve but not impossible. Nevertheless, the course will give you the incentive to try and learn on your own, with the help of Rforums, the Coursera discussions, Google etc. I would appreciate it if some things would be explained in more detail. A beginner most definitely needs more time to spend on the course than the hours estimated.",3
Very good introduction. light-weight explanations.Better animations and videos could enhanced the learning process.questions are too easy.Needs more complex tasks to integrates the different sections together.,3
"I truly love the course program and what it covers. And aiding student who can't afford the price by grants is relly nice. Then were students alloweed to download MATLAB freely! But teachers should be clear from the begining, what topics one must grasp before getting one's head into it. I don't think calculus and Linear algebra is enough, given some topics that are spoken about in the course. The teacher can explain mean things and in a second, speaks about totally incomprehensibe subject. Last but not least, I personally think the course lacks on additional materials. It would be really nice if there was something like handouts, pdf readings for deeper understanding of the concepts on offline times.",3
I am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge - however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me... I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus. It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again. I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments. I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate...,3
"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
"jogesh mupalla should be more descriptive about his explanation, he should explain if not all then most of the components of the bootstrap coding , which he sometimes skips or misses, otherwise the course is good",3
"some of the stuff was not mentioned properly, like for last quiz how to expoert data from mongodb",3
"Although the course pace was very well suited for a total beginner, I found the didactics of this course not so well-structured. The examples and starter codes caused quite some confusion, and the underlying coding principles were not made very explicit. I've finished an introductory Python course from the University of Toronto, and found that course much better structured. It gave me a level of understanding that I would probably not have reached by following the UMich course alone.",3
"Ok, it's an introduction, but it could at least show us some math or pseudocodes. A part from that, the course is really awesome. Well structured classes, good explanations and incredible interviews",3
"Terribly boring. Valuable information, nonetheless.",3
Basic stuff.Good choice of subjects.A little too short.,3
This course will be helpful for brands / people who begin their journey with personal branding and social media. The material contains many detailed personal examples and another great value of the course is in sharing experiences in the forums.,3
A little heavy on the biology side,3
"An okay introduction to the specialization; hopefully, the future courses will get into more detail.",3
"The topic and the class content itself are good, but the introduction is too brief. Hope they can add more stuff!",3
"Good course, but the video lectures are incomplete. The audience will benefit from seeing the full lecture videos. They can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185)",3
"materials didn't cover everything necessary for assignments, and time requirement was not clear",3
"learned something, but not as much as i expected. hope to add more nutrition knowledge.",3
"a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)",3
Hope recommend some more reading,3
Videos could be bigger and reduce the echo in particular,3
"Gives a good overview of topics and the specialisation, however is still very basic. I'm looking forward to the next advanced courses",3
"I would like to see the more practical information. The course is 90% built on PMBOK. I can read this guide on my own outside the course. In the course, I prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory.",3
"While I enjoyed most of the content of this course, I felt that it was one long advertisement for Duetto. I will certainly continue the course series because I enjoy the learning. Also, a note for presenters, please be aware of how distracting so many hand gestures can be. Thanks!",3
Excelent but haven´t this material in english,3
"The course covered very interesting topics, but it would have preferred more detailed explanation of PD controllers and especially how to choose the tuning constants.",3
"Instructor speaks very fast so that i read subtitles instead of hearing what he say, in addition to i stop video more times to understand what he say, but totally the scientific and technical contents are great also his advises for us in which how we can find the answers for our questions about data science",3
"Very excellent course for beginners. Hope that the next courses will be at the same level!Two main problems, though: first, the autograder is very bad, should be much more flexible.Second, in my opinion, the homework should be more code-based, just like the final project.",3
I wish that the videos were longer.,3
Gives a really broad overview of ML concepts. Examples (and assignments) use a commercial Dato product called (GraphLab Create). Expect nothing else.,3
"The instructor Jack looks very skilled in iOS, but is not very skilled in organizing his thoughts. Lot of sentences are changed halfway, making it frustrating and very hard to follow along.As in part one there is a steep chasm between the final peer assessment and the presented theory. Components required for the final assessment are introduced in part 3 of the specialization, which is to say a little late.",3
"Personally not a big fan of Roger Peng's approach while teaching. The lessons get a bit confusing, and so does the questions from the quiz.Jeff Leek's approach is more calm and simple.Nevertheless, the course in general is really good.",3
"The content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology, but it is somewhat, if not totally, a false representation of interaction with the experts. There is absolutely none.",3
"I'm not going to recommend this course strongly. I learned from it, not denying that. The reading materials were great. There are critical organization issues to learn. But there are two things I don't like. First, the assignment is not well designed. Article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes. Other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed. Second, the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations. I don't think people would ever remember or use them correctly. Why bother using them?",3
Personally they should add a free textbook and a vocabulary list with clear examples.So yes this course could benefit from more detail time to time,3
"I was a little confused because for having a focus on ""Science and Philosophy"", it seemed to me to mostly talk about science and religion through a philosophical lens. The last module was very scattered and hard to follow. Other than that, very interesting, well-presented material.",3
"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
its good and still more programming problems can be discussed to ease the learners to dive interest in R.,3
The composition and visual elements part of the course was incredible but the Lightroom part could be improved. Going through every feature in Lightroom is not helpful. It's better to focus on teaching key useful techniques to achieve desired effects,3
"It's Ok, nothing much to gain iin terms of knowledge realted to cyber conflict.",3
It is too simple and baic,3
Lecturer not conversant with subject.,3
"Interesting, but elementary content. But absolutely no support from 'teachers'.",3
It is a reasonable well-delivered course given the topic,3
"This course is too easy and more like a user manual, I wish there are more ""Why"" or ""principles"" inside. because the most important thing is to know ""why"". In my eye, ""functional programming Principles in Scala"" is this kind of real course that after taking it (it is not my priority right now so I will delay to finish it for a while). I can get the sense of the most important feature of a new language.",3
"The course is definitely has some value. At least it helps to feel the taste of quadrotor control. But there are some cons. 4 weeks is too short, and this entails fragmentation of course materials. A lot of reasonable questions are not answered and even not mentioned: we use Euler's angles, which lead to singularities and ambiguities, there are quaternions, but we'll not use it. Why? - no answer. PD gains tuning is manual. Is there any robust methods to build controls automatically? - no answer. And so on and so forth. And the last... lections are really boring, lector monotonically reads text, nevermind what - matrices, formulas, etc. He reads all of it in completely, with the same manner, without any interactivities with the slides. Actually it is realy demotivates. I guess one of students that made supplementary materials with marker will do much much better.Anyway, thanks for the course. I believe that highly motivated learner can get something new from it.",3
Solid introduction. Not so engaging if using the non-paid options,3
"Too simple, too easy",3
"Pros: Very clear explanations, useful slides for PMP preparation.Cons: Very easy questions and exams. Not challenging at all",3
Good class but very little case studies or real world example.,3
"A bit confusing in term of structure. We jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others. It gave a good general picture of what project management is about. But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project. However I have to say I didn't do the optional readings. At least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me",3
"Good for real beginner of programming, if you already have experience with any other language, this might be too easy",3
"student needs to read a lot out of this course in order to solve the exercises!the course materials are not enough, and they focus more on images, while this entire course for beginners level, it should be fundamental stuff.overall the course is good but needs more changes",3
"It was a little difficult grasping functions as I didn't have much programming background. The swirl practice modules were great but I wish they constructed some lessons that would build a function from top to bottom like we were asked to do in the programming assignments. The lectures, swirl practice modules, and quizzes were great but they all re-iterated the same basic information. I wanted to learn and practice building more functions by applying the basic information to do complex tasks.",3
Ambiguous assignments led to cumbersome completion. The peer grading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criteria for grading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.,3
"Good course.However the initial part ,that is recruiting hiring portion could have been conducted in a better manner.It felt as if the lecturer was reading out from a text book.",3
"While this course is well organized and descriptive, it barely touches the Internet of Things technologies.",3
Found the assignments were 'very loosely' aligned with the lecture material and had poorly formed problems in places.Lectures were reasonably good but not quite up to the standard set with other U of W Data Science courses or other University Data Science / Machine Learning courses I have taken.,3
"The lectures are all just the right length. As a working professional, it was easy to consume the course in my varying bits of free time. For the most part, the assignments were good. There were a few places where there were mistakes in the instructions or the code downloaded from github had some errors. It was fairly clear that these mistakes have been around for quite sometime, so I wonder why nobody ever bothered to update the code in github or update the bad instructions. This is the internet, not a published textbook. That should be pretty easy to fix. It was also a little disappointing that the 4th lesson was extra long in terms of lectures and had no related assignments. The course was marked as completed when I finished the 3rd assignment so the fourth lesson was effectively optional.",3
"I'm only rating this course 3 stars because it's just too easy. The information is good (what there is of it) and is presented well. It's just that the amount of effort needed to pass is minimal.For example, the fifth week had fewer assignments than the previous weeks, and the six week was only a quick review.The problem I have with these courses being so easy is that online courses already suffer from the widespread view that they're not as valuable as a ""real"" in-person course. So, when yet another one of these online courses is incredibly easy to pass, it only adds fuel to those people's arguments and reduces the overall value of the certificate of completion.I want my certificate to mean something. Please stop watering down these courses! Ditch the pay you pass mentality. Include more material to read. Make the tests longer and more difficult. Because, as they are, they don't even compare in difficulty to the junior college courses, much less the university courses, I've taken in the past.",3
"This course tries to address problems that might arise from game development. It's not an approach to the accounting problems, like finances, a game company may have, but mostly an approach to the bureaucratic problems of creating and publishing a game. It also provides knowledge about monetization pratices and publishing pratices, warning the future game developer how a publish may inadvertently ""throw a wrench in the works"" of game development.",3
"It accomplishes the main goal: help with the leap from C to C++, but:- It's damn slow. I had to use the 1.5x or 2x speed all the time, and I'm not native English.- The format of the slides is really ugly (e.g., those bullet points in the code)- No lecture notes are provided- The references are to his (expensive) books instead- No source code of examples is provided either- Graph theory is interesting, but out of scope. Waste of time for those who already know it are not interested in and just want to learn C++. It would be better to provide references for optional reading or reviewing.",3
Basic course and good for high school to undergraduates as the title suggest. Good for overview of managing your finance. Budgeting which is the cornerstone of managing money is well talked about.Very limited coverage on the investing portion and I disagree that intelligent speculation in the stock market is the way to educate individuals starting out on investment. I would prefer Dr Navarro teaching this topic and hearing his perspective on stock market. Asking people to cash out when a stock lose 10% is equivalent to selling low and buying high. A better question is has the business change when the stock price drops. A better read would be The intelligent investor.,3
"It's a very basic introduction. Would be nice to have the option to skip it for more advanced students.Also the recorded lectures are really quite, so you have to turn up the speaker a lot.",3
"Interesting stuff, but not a lot of detail",3
"Concepts are interesting, the assignments are not. Writing and re-writing about the teacher's generic game example. Not much opportunity to work on your own content.",3
"Five stars for the excellent teachers and content, but the course is not made for Coursera: very long videos, slides full of words, many references to the group work for the course at JHU, tiny quizzes and just two practical assignments. The format and the examinations can be definitely improved.",3
"Interesting, although course content and test questions were very easy.",3
I struggle sometimes with tests. But after all everything when was good,3
"The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos. There are some weird questions. My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions. Quizes are not very educating this time. Courses by Brian Caffo were much better.",3
"Great experience and basic knowledge of PE & VC but too much theory, and no descriptions given about the assumptions made while valuation.",3
"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.",3
"too easy,not fit me",3
"It is theoretical, which is nice, but more practical example like case study would have kindled my interest to go for the certificate.",3
"There is a problem with the peer reviewing of the assignment. Even you finished all tasks, you need to wait for receiving your grade. For example, I am still waiting for the grade of my assignments, specially I am waiting for more than two weeks for the grading of my assignment in week 2.",3
"Good course to start with the basics of photography. Group assessments can be hit or miss given varied experiences of other students, but overall a good place to start",3
"Given the nature of law courses (a lot of reading), there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides. Quotes from pieces of legislation, judgements from various courts, quotes from politicians etc. need to be provided on the slides, otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript, which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, or write what Prof. Gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down. IN SHORT: Better lecture slides with more information on.",3
"too basic,you need read more online resources to do real projects.",3
It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon. Too much theory.,3
"Good course, and well taught. Lecture videos and slides could be improved in terms of summarizing the content. Quiz questions don't reflect the content.",3
an online editor is not good,3
Altogether a useful introduction to an interesting topic -- despite the generalizing approach and the sometimes conservative instead of neutral presentation.,3
"Presents a useful analysis framework, but with limited practical examples to learn how to use analytical tools.",3
"This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests. I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before. I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful. So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities. In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students. I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3
"Pretty good in overall, but there are a few points that could be improved:- The content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesn't increase steadily. For example, week 4 and 5 feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject, but week 5 goes further. The last video of week 5 is interesting, but it seems improvised...- There could be more examples, especially from modern music. John from week 5 uses examples from the Beatles, which is great, but he's the only one. Week 3 has pretty much no examples at all.- Suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week. Week 2, 4 and especially 5 have good summaries of the videos and examples, but week 3 almost only has links to wikipedia...- The final exam is VERY difficult. There are some crazy chords and rhythm to analyse and there are advanced questions on points which have been seen very quickly in the videos.I can't really compare since I new some of the content of the class, but I think it's weel made for beginners as well as for intermediate musicians. But you'll probably need to do a bit of research yourself if you want to be ready for the exam.",3
"I little slow to start but the pace picks up nicely. Content is generally easy to follow. Some differences between spoken and voice recognition subtitled text. Practical tests were interesting but not particularly well explained for the MapReduce shapes task, which seemed to leave a few puzzled.",3
"Generally I like the contents of this course. I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches. However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep. I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills.Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts. I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise. Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems. Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction. For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?! Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications. Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task. It really makes the assignment experience awful.",3
"A great course and fully packed with interesting information about different methodologies thought time. Wouldn't give it 5 stars because most part during the video lectures are just silly and although I know the professor is trying his best to convey an idea, it seems like there are moments it just drifts away from the point. Also, the ""angel x devil"" debates are equally silly, opposite to the following overview video which is excellent. I'd recommend everybody to take this course but I certainly wouldn't do it again and neither dowload the videos for future reference.",3
Even though I liked how the teacher conducted her course in a dinamic way with 4 participants I expected more from this course.,3
"I appreciate knowing more now than I did before about story writing. I know better now how to approach assessing a story and critiquing it, and I really want to work on a story of my own next!Not going to lie, though, this course was difficult to immerse myself in simply because of the examples: I'm not into guns, not into muscle, not into violence, and every single example was either of men, or how a female's mission centered around the men in her life. If I could suggest a change in this course, it would be to consider all the different backgrounds of the people taking the course, and give examples that are more inclusive.",3
"Good course in general but it could use more exercises and solutions for those exercises. It could be a great course in futureAlso, sometimes it's confusing like you are asked to download code and write it along with the video but the files already (at least partially) contain the code that you should write and it looks quite different from the video.",3
"Course is very basic , although contents are compact and informative.",3
"Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignments. Profiling was not useful in this regard. While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignments. Also, Better examples of functions like lapply, tapply etc. besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing. Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in. This is also not helpful for explaining the material. The video content is largely just reading the text of the slides. It takes much more time to watch the reading of the slides than just to read them. This is not the best use of video. Neither is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking. It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used. The problem could be related to the assignments but different enough to not be copied. I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class.",3
Learned a lot and already integrated daily meditation into my life.,3
"The course is well put together, however they say you do not need any programming background, but you definitely need a little. I had to use other sources to help such as Codeacademy and Udemy just to keep up. The do not go over loops, conditionals or basic C foundation that would help. The leap from HTML, CSS to JavaScript is massive. They need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods. I took a similar one on Udemy (that was free) just after I completed this one and it was 10x easier to understand and closed so many loops I had when learning JavaScript.",3
Entry level for writing English emails.,3
The lecturer is honestly a bit slow in his coverage of content and his scribbling is untidy. He also seems to want to intentionally make SQL look like its very simple and avoids giving interesting facts which he thinks may complicate the content but would be good to know anyway.,3
"The primary lecturer is a little boring. She's quite knowledgeable and presents interesting material, however, she could benefit by animating her presentation style a little bit, so it doesn't sound like she's just reading it out loud.",3
"Not bad, the professor is very comunicative but I expected a bit more of contents",3
"Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered. You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful.",3
A lot of outdated information. A lot of mistakes. But still a good way to understand the basics.,3
Hate auto grading. Overall good basic course.,3
"Passing mark is 100%, it is tough for me and demotivating to persuade further. And the course becomes too extra factors and complexity on later classes, it made me to lose the interest on the algorithm and course.I cannot complete it because of these two factors",3
Figure out whether your idea makes sense to go to market,3
"This iteration of the course (August-September 2016) fizzled because so few students were actively participating. Early in the course, I worked diligently on my written contributions to the discussion forums, but then there was so little peer response that I gradually came to understand that I was mostly just talking to myself. Halfway through the course, I gave up on the forums.But I read all the poems, viewed the videos and took the quizzes. The quizzes are lame, the poetry selection is great, and the video lectures are all worthwhile.I had initial misgivings about some of the videos. The improvised round-table discussions of meta-poems by Dickinson, Stevens and Mullen (module 4, lesson 4) initially seemed too colloquial and not incisive, but then I realized they had value as models for how to grope into an initial understanding of a strange poem. The lecture on Hart Crane (module 1, lesson 4) was too difficult for me to follow in real-time spoken form, but then I found I could understand some of it by frequently stopping and starting the video, re-reading the lecture text in transcript, and taking long breaks for careful review of Crane's verse and for research about some of its allusions and associations. That lecture might have made more sense in purely written form, and I wonder if it was so daunting that it scared off some of the students who started the course.As a whole, the course managed a satisfying balance between discussion of the poetry itself and discussion of the social and economic contexts in which the poetry was created and consumed. I especially appreciated the clarity of Karen Ford's many lectures and Tim Newcomb's lively and enthusiastic investigation of the role of little magazines in the 1910s & 1920s.",3
It is very short to feel like a real class. Video Lectures are too short too. I liked the readings.,3
"While it is a good class, I have a message that one of my assignments is passed by not verified. I have no instructions on how to ""verify"" it. I'm disappointed something that should be simple is such a roadblock.",3
Missing course material about how calculating fact table size ans sparsity,3
"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment.",3
"This was a good course, a little hard to follow at times but very beneficial.",3
"Very good information with a fantastic understanding of the variety of artists. However, I almost dreaded logging in to watch the lectures; they were often boring me to tears. Were this information presented in a more engaging way, this review would be much higher.",3
Rough around the edges. The assignments are not clear enough. I never got contacted by my mentor and didn't know how to reach out to him either.Content is good.,3
It was not challenging. Could raise the difficulty a little.,3
Good quick introduction. Very good. Easy to work through the Exercise Sets. Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.,3
Interesting course and specialization. A few inaccuracies need to be corrected so it can be properly pursued at its best.,3
"instructor is just reading out slides hence, it's not that exciting to watch the lectures. Just can read through slides to complete it",3
Course content was nice. Delivery was good. Learn a lot that I have never been aware of.Course logistics was lacking. Hard to keep track where one was. Information about the course was sparse.,3
"Pros:Some useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommender systems.Cons:Very diluted content.Mostly large text slides with the presenter talking in a monotone voice.Programming exercises are done in Java and require deploying an IDE + an unused open source project developed by the authors. Hint to the authors: use Python, R or Octave like everyone does.Some of the questionaries are ambiguous.",3
I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,3
"I was hoping the lectures would be more dense. My previous coursera courses where on data science, machine learning, etc. I somewhat feel that the content on those courses is twice or thrice more.",3
Videos tended to be a bit longer than necessary. Might consider c,3
"It wasn't challenging but more irrelevant to what I'd guess is a lot of ""workplaces""",3
Awesome course! Intensive learning. I recommend a few studies of astronomy before take it.There are some issues with the feedback of others proffesors,3
Very light & not really consistent with the heavy workload of subsequent courses. Felt it could have been much much stronger explaining GitHub- which shows up as a problem in latter courses strongly suggesting that toolbox does not effectively cover GitHub for newbies,3
"I think someone who has never coded before can approach this course. However, further reading of the resources presented will augment what has been taught and to better handle the quizzes.",3
"I like the content of the course.However, there are some remarks I want to share.For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud. I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future. I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all.",3
I think these courses need to be condensed into a single one as the contents are rather limited individually.,3
"The evaluation part of the course needs some fixing. Otherwise, very good course!",3
"This course is very thorough, but I did not feel that the lessons often prepared me for the programming assignments. I found that I was frequently looking on the internet for additional resources and finding that I was definitely not alone.",3
"It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer. Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough.Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit. Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit's intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course. Additionally, given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C, a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course.",3
Should have been a complete course. The course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated,3
It focuses too much on bootstrap framework instead of in my view focusing on building responsive sites from scratch,3
Excessively short course.,3
"The course is fun but the content is too general. I like to know more methods and technics to develop a game world, considering genres, mechanics and gameplay options.",3
"Good material, ,but VERY sloppy in MS Excel handouts. Lot's of mistakes which confused the student. Please do better job of QA before posting these documents.",3
"It was a good start, but I wish the assignments were a little bit harder.",3
"It's more towards teaching linguistics and theoretical concepts. I understand that is also required to understand the subject. However, I was expecting more practical training on coding different programs with various ways. I suggest to introduce a balance in theory concepts and practical training.",3
"Somewhat too simple, but still a good basic introduction.",3
problems..problems ongoing,3
There is a very technical portion to this class making it difficult for the neophyte to truly understand and explain course content.,3
Great course from a high level overview perspective. I was interested in a more technical course related to FHIR and it's application in the industry.,3
"The effort put for explanation by Dr. Fowler is extraordinary. However the course needs to show more of the 'connection between steps' when stating a theorem for convergence tests.This current version of calculus is a bit disappointing, earlier the practice problems were solved in steps.",3
"Good course but a little more detail with better referencing to links and documents would be more helpful. Also, a little more in-depth info for each topic will also be well appreciated. Overall a good course for beginners like me who knew nothing about Wind Energy before taking this course.",3
Theorical Course. Nice for those that want to understand some concepts of IoT,3
The presenter was good but the course was too basic and barely an overview. It needed to be longer to be worth it,3
"Compared to the other courses, this one is kind of boring, but learned some origination of dogs :)",3
Upgrade to submit? That's meaningless. Especially for this fundamental course.,3
"Nice tips, long for what you get out of it though",3
Handy and Informative,3
"Overall, I sincerely think this course was useful to me. I did learn, and that is great. I got some good advice from the reviewers. And I appreciated most of the videos, especially the shop talks.But I wish the instructor or his staff were more present in the discussion area, and I would have preferred a better written material. The transcripts are not formatted. They are completely raw and difficult to use.Furthermore, I don't think it is normal that people duly registered to the class have difficulties to get their 3 reviews. Too many people have to ask for it in the forums.In conclusion, a good course with good video material, but a lack of presence and organization.",3
"I wish they could let us take the quizzes without having to pay to verify that we have understood the lectures. However, the topic of the course and the lectures are clear and on point. Love the lessons so far!",3
A bit complicated for a beginner.,3
Greate course for beginners.,3
"While the content and the curriculum of the course is ok, the course is not moderated enough in terms of answering the questions the participants have",3
"The material covered in the course is adequate and relevant to various aspects to our social lives. The course's purpose is to get you acquainted with the broad field of emotion study, to pique curiosity and fuel further research and deep dives into the multiple topics that are presented. It does this very well by offering lots of references to research papers, articles and videos. The course doesn't aim to dig deep into its topics. This remains as your task depending on your interests. As a final note, and this is critique I've already submitted, the presenter doesn't add too much to the slides in the videos. He basically reiterates what is written on the slides and doesn't expand on it much or at all. You're basically given links and references to what to learn by yourself. Hopefully this will change in future reiterations of the course.",3
"This course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more. However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...not to mention too heavy on the PWC pitches. The quizzes and assignments don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignments are structured poorly. Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious learners.",3
could be better,3
"Assessments are way harder than the taught content, be aware to spend way more time on them than the estimates.",3
Grading by students concept is not 100% accurate. No feedback from teachers. Material is not very easy explained.,3
"This is very much a primer. I was hoping it would go into more detail than it did, but I did find it a very helpful overview.",3
Helpful and clear.I would like it more if it had more elaboration and practice on the presented tools.Thanks!,3
Good starter setup. Looking forward to the technical portion of the Specialization.,3
Nice course to understand the basics of graphic design,3
"The course itself is good. Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts.",3
Hi My name is Kapil Raj and i am from India. This is the first course i have done from Coursera. Its an awesome course. Its a great course for someone who have just wanted to learn programming or have a little prior knowledge in programming.,3
"Various helpful techniques but I did find the course rather boring, especially the multiple-choice questions and all the ""scientific"" facts about the brain. It also seems more geared towards high-school or university students than towards the general public, so maybe I was just not in the target audience.",3
It is not letting me submit my lesson 1 review without payment.,3
The course depended in big proportion of the material of Rob Stokes. It's OK to make the process as Stokes suggest but I think you can put more of yourself.,3
Informative and provide some great ideas and insights.,3
"Too microsoft-oriented, too much reading (sometimes not very related to the topic) that is not unique and can be easily found on the internet without attending this course, not enough video presentations and explanations.Final exam seemed to me a bit out of topic.",3
I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,3
This course is good introduction in digital marketing.,3
Needs more in-depth analysis of loops and type of arguments. Rest all is great.,3
"Introductory course to data structures. The lectures are good, however the assignments are too much guided. Sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on.",3
I think this course is to basic. It's more for people who not has managment educational formation looks more like a personal financial course. its can get better but they need to add more advancing subjects.,3
"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!",3
short but good introduction,3
"The course is best suited for an Intermediate student. Course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective. For graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommended.Advantages:-very simple descriptions-even a non mathematical background student can easily understand-Proofs in all forms(geometric, analatic, practical) descrition.Disav:-basic are explained and consuming too much time-dosnt going for advanced level-no high level explanations or topics.",3
Course material reference readings were good but videos were pathetic. It was more like a high school kid reading the slides.,3
illustration is not enough for the commands. More schematic description could help understanding the course much better.,3
"Some interesting concepts are being taught, but the course is uneven. The first project required a lot of work, while the last week had no project at all.Minor errors in videos and programming assignments. Somewhat messy code.",3
"Lectures and the homework are not quite relevant. The instructor explains so little on programming, but the assignment are tough.",3
"It's better than the first course of the series, but there is room for some more difficult assignments.",3
Too much history,3
This is a nice introduction to social media marketing with professional insight from Randy Hlavac. I felt the content was a little too basic though.,3
"4/5 for content, 2/5 for presentation. Compared to other courses, the lecturer is slow and often reads from slides. Nevertheless thanks for the course.",3
"There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and ""chunked"" into real knowledge.So, a better name for this course would be ""Learning how to learn academically"". As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.",3
Content could have been boiled down to about 3 lectures. Most of it was common sense. The high level over view of the life cycle of data analysis projects was interesting and overall this was a good introduction to the field.,3
pretty cool course,3
Interesting and enjoyable; but I was looking for more of a rigorous introduction to Plato. The professor goes to a great deal of effort to make what otherwise might be a dry material engaging; but I sometimes felt like I was watching one of those science programs for children where they sell how great science with fun graphics.,3
"I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation. Also, the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete. This is good because if what the activity desn't really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you've learned. However, as I've said, if what you're being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn't all that practical. I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you've learned and whether you've retained the information or not.",3
I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making. What I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overviews.,3
"The second part of the course is very good. But first part, with introductions and definitions were very ""heavy"".",3
"A solid course, let down by quality issues in the last two modules. I hope these are fixed soon because it would make this a top notch course...",3
Needs to cover more material in a more engaging way. Felt too lecture-based and observational. Possibly story-telling itself needs to be anchored more to specific usage occasions.,3
"A good course for people who are trying to lean the basics of cyber security.Regards,Kashif",3
"The book really gave more details about the individual chapters. Hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videos.I recommend that specializations should follow this trend, so students who find it difficult to access Internet can use the book as a guide.More examples are needed to understand the concepts especially Tuples and DIctionary",3
A very enlightening course ... i would have liked to hear more about the mythology and the gods roles,3
"It's ok, good for remeber concepts",3
"The accent of this teacher made me struggle to comprehend some of the most basic concepts she was presenting. I learned way much more on the previous modules of this specialization.The course should be 2/5 stars, but thanks to Boston and McKenzie articles, I will give an extra one.",3
I found the video lectures less helpful with this course (than the quantitative course) and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information. I did enjoy the assignments ( observation and interview processes) and found the application helped better understand the theory.,3
"This class gets very math and theory heavy, so I would not recommend it for those looking for programming practice with the algorithms/programming approaches presented in this class. If you want thorough theoretical background information, this class would be a better fit.The use of RNA secondary structure alignment as an example of dynamic programming implementation is overkill. There are much simpler ways to introduce dynamic programming.",3
"Well presented and clear,. however, the course is more a history of smartphone operating systems than emerging trends of the technology.",3
"The course starts with a nice mathematical support. Midway it looses connection with mathematical details in a way that it becomes too vague and does not empower the student to really grasp the concepts. Some energy-based proofs and the few formulas presented are inserted a bit adhoc and not properly explained.Despite not being to my liking in terms of depth, It is a good course as a general understanding of what has been accomplished in robotic legged-locomotion, what the state of the art is and where to find literature.",3
HW is a bit boring,3
useful but boring!,3
"The course is a good introduction to Organic Photovoltaics. The instructors have done a good job to present a rather complicated topic in a manner that is accessible to a common audience.However, there are a few areas of improvement that can be noted for future versions of this course:First, All material is given equal priority in the course. I think what the instructor can do is to summarize the important ""take aways"" at the end of each video lesson. This helps the learner grasp the concept betterSecond, The explanation can be a little clearer - especially the topic of polymerization. Someone without an organic chemistry background, can find it frustratingly hard.Third, the tests are sometimes not in line with the previous video lessons and the reading material. The tests should be much much sharper.Fourth, the reading material should be improved vastly in terms of English quality, structure and presentation of key points. Sometimes, the learner can find it hard to understand some topics (ex: stability and materials) because it is inadequately explained. These topics should be explained better.Overall, a great start - but can be better. Well done and Thank You!",3
"The course is OK, but I'd rather learned app development with Python or Java.",3
please improve hand-out for self study.,3
to basic,3
It was great but I can't continue it because I am from Iran and living there too so I can't pay and enroll next courses :(It was just like a great starter with no purpose for me.,3
Good course with well explained topics.,3
"The lectures were good, but many assignments had errors (graders, errors in code)",3
"Good , but not very detailed for programming the Arduino",3
"An interesting overview, but I wish it had been a bit more rigorous.",3
This course has contents that are repeated multiple times throughout the course. I think entire course could have been covered in a week or at most two weeks.,3
Great instructors.Lots of historical references and terminology. I would prefer more details about how stuff actually work - in simple layman's terms.Looking forward to the second course.,3
"This is a good introductory course, however the quiz questions and over dependence of graphlab are off putting. The instructors share good insights about the need and motivation for various ML techniques. I wish there was more support on the project using pandas and sklearn. Graphlab is immensely powerful, however not adopted in industry making it hard to apply the learning in real world.",3
Seemed like pretty basic stuff for the cost of the certificate.,3
"The videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker. Also although most of the tests were easy to complete, the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer, were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question.",3
Not enough students to give review grading and earn a grade.,3
"OK, but not really in-depth. Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet.",3
"This course is very basic for a person with an IT background, but nevertheless might come in handy for people without relevant experience.",3
discussion thread should be answerable and solution to the test should be available...all other things are good.,3
Bit basic for me,3
"The proposition of the course is very interesting. The content, especially from the required book is very good but I think the instructor could dive deeper in the content of her lectures and they could be a little bit more dynamics.",3
"The course is very well structured, but the teacher is boring",3
It's not bad but I think the other courses in this specialization are much better,3
A nice introduction. Not formal enough.,3
"Didactically I was a little disappointed since, as so often, allegedly innovative e-learning is based on a conventional transmission pedagogy, with the instructur delivering frontal-teaching-style lectures and the learner imitating the instructions. As a comparative novice in the field, I'm not sure that I am now able to apply independently what I imitated for the assignments. Scripting went right over my head.Rhetorically, many of the lectures were preformulated written texts rattled off, sometimes quite fast, in spite of the complexity of some of the information. Where the instructor formulated freely, the excessive Uuuhms and ""go ahead's"" nearly drove me bonkers.On the whole, a useful course, though.",3
I was hoping for something a little more scientific and a little less home-ec-y.,3
"It is a very entertaining broad introduction to the topic of philosophy in general. The lecturers are very knowledgeable and are very good teachers. However, I wish there would be a more detailed treatment of the topics in question. I look forward to their future course on Philosophy of Science, as I believe that by focusing on a more narrow topic, they will be able to go a bit more in depth.",3
"This course is very difficult. I recommend only taking it if you have some experience with syntax. Although very challenging, I learned a ton.",3
"A resource if your starting with Swift. Video quality is often poor. Examples are a bit too contrived. Generally, presentations should be better prepared, too much figuring things out during the video. Good choice of project for the practical.Many interesting coding practice tidbits along the way but needs polish.",3
"The teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project, which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course. What a pity!",3
"I would have liked to put 5 stars. This topic is so important and relevant to big data. After week 4 hands on part, it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week 3. That was very disappointing.Moreover, the structure of the course is not as good as the other module. I don't understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on (Not enough hands on to reflect the theory) part.On a constructive note, I would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week 3 with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning OR I would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them.",3
"In my opinion, the course is too basic. Many things looks like teaching 5-years old children by serious professors.But the material is given as natural as possible and milestones are clear and understandable.",3
"1. Sometimes the audio of the recordings is poor, making it difficult to listen.2. For non-speakers of Spanish, the translations are not so great and sometimes lack proper grammar or are almost literal translations of the spoken Spanish version. This makes the subject matter, although very interesting, very difficult to fully grasp. This also occurs in the quizzes, causing me to either misunderstand or not understand the questions.Overall, it is a very interesting course but the 'execution' is not up to standard. It could be improved by updating the audio recordings, and correcting the translations for the subtitles",3
"Lecturer is downright boring and not engaging.Could had used more real-world companies as examples for teaching, including pictures, but it's the same bland slides again and again.",3
You should skip module 8 from week 3. You can't work along because the website parse.com do not accept new members....Don't rush to purchase an apple developer account!,3
This Course presented some valuable insight into what the public are urged to believe on this controversial epidemic...,3
It's a good course to learn about data structures for beginers.,3
"A little too theoretical and the subjects are not easy to follow.It should have more step by step and deep explanation (math stuff).The interest rates vs bonds are difficult for begginers, it should be transmitted in different ways.",3
The course is awesome in terms of topics covered. But the pace is too fast. moreover the lectures are not comprehensive. It is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help,3
I think this class is best for academic people. I did not find what i was looking for.,3
"To get value from the class, I used other on-line materials to understand the topic. Thus, I spent about 20 hours/week on this class.",3
"This could've been better, but i understand that you want to minimize time of videos, but at the end it lacks many information about delegates and protocols and so on",3
I think it could have less videos teaching how to install Python and more about the language principles.,3
This course was a let down. There wasn't enough practical or real world examples to practice with. Good candidates would have been software companies in the SaaS space.,3
"I expected much more in this course. In my point of view, a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen. I thought this course would be focused in Object Oriented Programming and all about the best practices, why not? But it didn't, sometimes was very hard to go on with this. Anyway, thank you all.",3
"Good structure but a basic course.It´s a good compilation of information about iOS and Android.I think that some generic informations should be also consider on this course no matter if it´s iOS or android.Some videos explaining the features like (gps, siri, multi-core processor...) would be good.",3
"The teacher was wonderful as always. The course is given with sqllite, I would have liked a bit more experience with raw SQL queries. But the course shows you how to create and manage your databases with Python in an efficient way.",3
It is intresting Course,3
The instructor is really makes the topic boring. I would also like to see more examples of real world application.,3
"A bit of a mess. If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups, you will be disappointed. Assignments are good and thought-provoking, but not clearly written. You will get out of the course what you invest in it. Take your assignments seriously and invest a lot of time, even if you know that you are able to pass with a lesser effort.",3
"One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignments / quizzes. But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!). Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners. Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the modules where they are presented.",3
"This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices. Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student. That being said, a programming newbie should have no problem following it.The professor speaks slower than necessary. 1.75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow.In addition, it uses an old version of Python, which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying.",3
"Some of the examples used and the assignments given were quite old dated that no longer exist. Also, some of them were region specific tasks. This is a global course site and hence course structure should be such that every region could easily access the information and can contribute well in the assignments.",3
First two weeks are too repetitive with other courses,3
"It is a good course, but I'm not sure it's simple enough for beginners - it doesn't teach you all the steps you need to know",3
"Lots of random details that the professor seems to have missed make the course difficult because you end up spending hours debugging random, irrelevant things.",3
Good to build python basic data the concept clear,3
3 stars for the missing pdf slides. other than that it was very well structured and oraganized!!,3
"Interesting material, but wasn't necessarily of the same depth of knowledge like previous courses in the series",3
"It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class. But the teacher (Bless his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics. It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal. That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all. Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too. I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons. If that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates. What's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'.",3
"All homework were to modify from an existing code, and all lessons were skimming on indexes. I learned less than other courses from this series.",3
"Even though the video lectures, discussion forums, swirl & reading resources are informative, there is a huge disconnect between the assignments & what is taught. It is impractical for people who have just been introduced to R(with no background in programming) to take up this course.The graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help first-timers get used to coding in R. I do not think Swirl; even though a valuable resource; achieves this task remotely.",3
I really liked the fact that we were given an overview of all the machine learning techniques before we actually delve deeper. However I would have rather appreciated it further if we used open source python libraries rather than graphlab!I think the use of graphlab really did limit our scalability and use elsewhere other than on the course.Please do consider using open source tools in further courses and also provide starter code for the assignments in one open source library in addition to the code provided using graphlab.,3
Slow review process (can be).,3
Very technical and focuses more on cosmology than on the principles of Philosophy of Science,3
This is an interesting course but I'm disappointed at the lack of female lecturers/interviews. I'm a female and would appreciate leadership/encouragement via role models from educators in this traditionally male-dominated field.,3
Videos are too short,3
very informative and interesting course. However it was mind bogglingly confusing about what was exactly required for the final assignment. Please be clearer next time!,3
"The cartoons and animations used in this course really make statistics a lot easier and interesting. However few modules especially the later part of probability do not explain the concepts thoroughly. However, this is a great place to start!Also, the addition of R exercises are a great idea",3
Simple and easy to follow,3
"It's a nice course to review good work habits, but it mostly states the obvious.",3
"Was an interesting course but, at least to me, seemed to lack relevant material I was hoping for. When Addressing the concepts of Ebola, SARS, or the concepts of anti-vaccination the content was vague. But overall I thought the course was very informative on the concepts of how infections can spread and how we can track the movements in order to help control infection rates. I will definitely be going back to rewatch some of these lectures in the future.",3
"Good course, but could have explored the topic with more depth.",3
good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.,3
There are some ideas expressed in video that I found helpful. The assignments were very helpful as I was able to prepare for the 1st day of teaching.,3
Robert Schiller has given a good start to understand financial markets which the course provided are informative. Coursera is a great place to learn different subjects without borders.,3
Excel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization. A business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization,3
The lesson is informative but the course professor does not share value on each slide. She's reading each point and does not provide additional insight.,3
"A good course, but maybe a little lacking in depth.",3
"The course is too simplistic in my opinion. The entire 7 week course should be condensed into the first week - a single one hour lesson.Still, I appreciate the time and effort of the course staff and thank them for providing the course.",3
I'm still not completed the full course but i can say it's good course and very awesome Instructor,3
"I am giving this 3 stars for one reason. Although the instructor was terrific and the subject matter interesting, you cannot take the quizzes/tests without purchasing the course (I like to test my retention of the material). As I am an elderly and retired audit-only student and have NO interest in getting a certificate or using the course for college credit, I found that off-putting and dropped the class. Hopefully, other Coursera courses are not going to adopt the same requirement.",3
"Good subject and good selection of documents.I don't appreciate the ""speaker"" voice on the presentation, I rather like to see and hear the author. Too fast and too short.",3
"Professor was quite knowledgeable, and covered a breadth of topics. However, he often presented his political opinion as scientific fact. The quizzes/tests were also based on regurgitation of data/knowledge, rather than higher-order thinking such as application or synthesis",3
As someone who isn't from math background many of concepts thought in here weren't quiet clear or intuitive. Could use more details or pointers to reading materials to help understand the concepts better,3
too repetitive and too much dialogue bullshit,3
I liked it!The only problem is a webcam that a lot of people do not have.,3
"Interesting, I would have liked to deepen SQL knowledge and practice. The conceptual parti seems a little bit too important.",3
Very limited information on Wordpress. Then added some lectures on web design that could have used information relevant to Wordpress such as image compression plugins instead of tinypng.com (see last component).,3
"Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush. Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity. The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph.",3
"Too high level compared to what I expected, but does give a good overview of the topic.",3
"This is a useful course, but please look into the spelling and grammatical errors in the text.",3
That course is quite good to get the fundamental knowledge about power electronics,3
I learned some creative codings in html 5,3
Grading rubric is too generic: If peers don't leave feedback then the student is left to draw assumptions from loosely-defined parameters.,3
"Honestly, for something that says ""Advanced"" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic. There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense. Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice.",3
Great course to introduce you to basics of graphic design and basic design language.,3
its a good course but have some problems in the quizzes,3
Unbelievably difficult for understanding!,3
"Interesting enough, good start to the specialization but not the most content for a standalone course.",3
I was disappointed by the lack of response from teachers to the consultations,3
"While I am aware that this is an overview of the other courses in the specialization, I felt that the quizzes and programming exercises didn't really get into the actual topic. For example the recommender systems quiz and programming assignment have nothing about factorization except a single superficial question. The material is clear and the overview is nice, but the practical part let me down.",3
"In short, I am somewhat disappointed with the course overall. Of course both speakers have amazing experiences and that is valuable in itself but I do believe the structure of the lectures is not envolving as it should be. It seems that the basic rationale is being 'fired' in a not so much 'educative fashion'. Still there is much to learn from these contents.",3
"I dont like how this course was presented. The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient. I mean, because the instructor only speaks moving hands from one side to other, it was very difficult to visualize what and where the instructor was referencing to. Eg. a figure with 3 formulas and many variables there was no way to know in what alpha variable in formulas the instructor was talking about, once all formulas had the alpha variable. Also, when trying to describe a 3D environment only moving hands, its quite impossible to determine what and where the instructor is. One suggestion to try to minimize this problem would be try to use a lase pointer or a stick or a pen or something similar to help the student to now where the instructor exactly is. One example of good presentation is the course of ML from Andrew Ng where he writes all the things while speaking which facilitates the student to follow the sequence. Hope this can help.",3
"The videos were pretty goods. But a bit too slow and easy. The assigments were ok, but too guiding. Also there were too much reimplementation of algorithm",3
"Almost nothing relevant to start working, but fine.",3
"The course is great resource of information. The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture. This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I ""attend"" Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.",3
"Awesome stuff. Useful things covered, but the student should be able to be tested in creating himself code, not just run or (simple( edit the existing code.",3
"Content is good, less well polished than Odersky's courses though. Painful exercises with a lot of time spent on understanding the instructions instead of focusing on learning parallelism methods (especially the final assignment). Overall happy to have learnt from this, but clarity of assignments should be improved.",3
"It is good course, but I would like it to be in the more material and details of Python.",3
"very fundamental, but the instructor is tiresomely talkative...for example, when he talked about examples, he compared each two numbers again and again, what I want to is the logic to find the max/min number, not 49 is larger than 9!!!everyone knows it !! he compared every number every time ....it is boring!!! I will not choose this course if there are other python courses open at this time!!",3
Good material and practical ideas for the day-to-day use at work.,3
Would have liked to have more assignments and content on imagemaking rather than a focus on making a book. I feel like I got just as much imagemaking experience from the intro to graphic design course offered by Cal Arts.,3
too short and simple,3
It should show more how to implement the skills learned in real life.,3
"The course is good but it has too much Chinese, and I'm not Chinese.",3
"The structure of the lectures as well as the assignments might need some redesign.In the lecture, I think it might be better to explain the algorithm very clearly without talking about any coding details first, and then have some lectures explaining the code implementation. Right now, the coding implementation and the algorithm explainations are mixed together in a way that is not really easy to digest.However, I really appreciate the solid content of this course. The markov assignment is a actual assignment copied from the CS201 course in Duke. Moreover, it is implemented with even a more sophisticated and better desiged structure. In the CS201, the concept of inheritance is not introduced yet. For all of you who made it to week03 assignment, you can applaud yourselves.Sadly, the assignment design of this course is very disappointing. Despite its rich content, it requires the students to take a long time to adjust some details at some corner of the method to do the quiz question. It is very error prone and tedious. The final quizs need some simplification in the structure or format.Overall, I still recommend people taking this course. Very Good content. Just be prepared for the assignment, it really needs a considerable amount of patience and efforts.",3
This course was quick and simple. I enjoyed the definitions and monetary examples. I would have more quizzes and harder questions.,3
The early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity. The lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business.,3
"The javascript was very difficult, I could not complete. Def, for someone who has more javascript uner their belt.",3
"I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures. Then, the videos kept getting unclear and outdated. The assignment is not engaging. My interest dropped. The videos really need updates!",3
"Liked the course, but it was a little easy (took four days total to do the material for the whole course). Many questions were left unanswered (such as how dependent the credibility intervals are on the choice of prior distribution and the assumed distribution of the data), and it didn't touch on later topics that are interesting (MCMC sampling). Again, good beginning course, but I was looking for more in depth study.",3
Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
"Interesting, but content is a bit limited",3
Good course to begin machine learning with but it's too easy !!,3
its a 7 week course but it covers very basics which can be easily completed in one week instead of 7 weeks +1 star for funny prof. ;),3
"Some instructions of the programming assignments are not all that clear, which wasted me a lot of time.",3
This was actually pretty hard. I felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught - and the amount of R itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end.,3
Too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.,3
Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.,3
Very interesting as lay person interested in topic.,3
It would be even more interesting if the chinese caracters were written with the Pinyin (and not just the pinyin).,3
A little too common sense.,3
"very shalow information, I would like if this course had a contination.",3
"Opening the quizes and the internal acreditation for free should be a most for such a good course like this.Its a shame that ""non premium"" users have access to only the video material.",3
"I am mixed on this class. I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms. But I don't feel like it's helping me become effective at using them. The course would get a higher rating if it focused more on practical applications, and not so heavy on the algebra. Also, it would get a higher rating if it used Python, rather than Octave for the programming platform.",3
"Well constructed and easy to follow, but lacks mathematical derivation.",3
Too complicated for those who are new to philosophy. The basic concepts not very clearly explained. It seems that teachers had the assumption that students already had some previous knowledge of philosophy.,3
hard to follow.. usually I don't know what is he talking about..,3
In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference).The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,3
Very basic if one has already worked with software before.,3
Good to follow by the subs,3
"Was expecting more of the how to's and a bit of programming or at least concepts of the programming/statistics, but I guess there are different interpretations of the idea of a crash course.Definitely geared for people who work with data scientists but not in the data science field.",3
I would have liked the quizzes to explain why an answer was right or wrong.,3
good learning with explanation on basic financials,3
"Nice and clear course, but the level is not university level...",3
Not as good as the former three in the Specialization. The BootStrap part could be better in my opinion.,3
"To US centered. Would have expected international approach as Coursera should appeal to World. Also too theoretical, more graphs and formulas would help to understand. For example deman and supply functions. When there is cost function determining or demand in certain industry dependent on market structure. When Price or MR determines equilibrium between S and D etc. Too simplistic.",3
This course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics. Lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease (biological lens). I guess that is why its water supply and sanitation POLICY.,3
"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.",3
"Great professor and good content.The biggest problem with this course is the quizzes: not challenging and requires no critical thinking. I was hoping to come into this course doing quizzes that Prof. Shiller gives his Yale students, but I was completely disappointed.Moreover, there are some technical issues with the videos. A lot of them cut off in the middle and I ended up having to go to Youtube to find the full versions.",3
got better as I went along. The first few weeks were a little rough,3
"Very nice, interesting but videos are too long comparing others courses.",3
"You cannot submit your quizzes nor your program assignment unless you're a paying member.This is the first time I ran into such a class in Coursera.Sad.Please allow non-paying people who want to learn, to participate in quizzes and peer graded assignments, like other institutions are doing.",3
"A good course. However, I would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed. In its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy. However, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid.",3
"the capstone project had peer reviews, requesting you to consider executive feedback, otherwise i am not able to actually judge the quality of my work",3
"The material is OK, the video quality is regular and the instructors are childish. I prefer the Android specialization where the instructors are more mature and professional.",3
Too much law for non lawyers,3
Thats a good course for beginers.In my opinion should be more illustrative with more real and nice examples.,3
Very well Explained.Tried to cover basic in very systematic way.,3
I posted a question on the last week on the forum and never received an answer from a mentor. I had one response from another student which did not actually address the issue of my question and I had several views. And it wasn't as if there were a lot of questions posted. One course mentor could have easily answered all of them.,3
The course introduces us to a ton of valuable material for developing data products. But it is up to the student to have the initiative to dig deeper into the material by going through the various API reference documentations in order to create the final data applications. I'm not sure there is a better way to teach this course; but it felt like I was left to my own devices to complete the course. In a way it was a good learning experience to have to complete the assignments without much hand-holding from the instructors.,3
"plz last lecture in this course, you can better understanding to me.",3
Too basic. No processed foods.. ok but what else?,3
"Doesn't provide as much of an in-depth info as I was expecting, but its a good course to get you started with hybrid app development.",3
It was great overall but my review reflects the sentiment that I felt like they could've added more topics.,3
"the ""practical"" part is not really existent",3
"A quite simple beginning, might end up being a little bit too simple. The future looks promising, though!",3
"I was inerested about this course, but I couldn't understand enough - the speaker talked too fast and I've lost the main subject trying to understand. Sorry.",3
"Several papers for the course are behind pay walls. No one seems to monitor the forums on an ongoing basis. As someone new to the field of molecular genetics, I took the course to learn about the seminal work. I found the context and explanations by the professor to be very helpful.",3
"I really enjoyed weeks 1 and 2. They were more business focused. Weeks 3 through 6 were super technical. All in all, it was a great primer for satellite communications. Congrats to the team!",3
"This course provided a good introduction to SQL for me as a beginner and through challenging lessons forced me to learn SQL basics. After Week 3 however, I found that the level of difficulty increased steeply and not enough assistance was provided in the lessons to get through the course at a reasonable pace. In addition to providing answers to each week's exercises, further review of how the answer was obtained and the breakdown of the logic behind it would be helpful.",3
needs weekly code testsneeds more quiz questionsneeds more usage samples - e.g. autolayout/specific UI components gotchas,3
"This course is way too much concentrate on studies for students, not well correlate with studies for everybody",3
"3 stars because the lecturer is really good but talks a little bit fast so foreign students cant clearly understand what he means or get ""lost"" in the course. You will say ""you can reduce the speed"" but this would reduce the sound quality too.",3
Course was informative and a useful refresher but could have done with more worked examples in the tracking area specifically around value.,3
"I liked the topics. However, i've liked this course to review the concepts of forms and the types associated: radio buttons, combobox, etc.",3
"Not enough face to camera time, in comparison with the other two modules in this course specialization. For me, that made it harder to recall the information effectively. But a very interesting topic.",3
Its a very small and easy course,3
Learned a few things from this course.,3
Provides good tips for how to inc,3
the content should be presented more interesting.,3
"I think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic, but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of Bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards. But it's definitely for people with solid JS and CSS bases.",3
The course is nice and informative. Unfortunately one can not do any of the pear rated assignments or pear reviews.,3
"Excellent content undermined by technical problems. The non-multiple-choice assignment (which involves analyzing a business plan) is particularly annoying. It requires uploading of screenshots but there is no ""upload"" feature is available. The assignment must be graded by ""peers"" -- which means, if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it, you're out of luck.Re: content, I would discourage you from taking this course if you don't speak fluent French. Indeed, you even need to understand how the French sometimes mis-translate into English, because some words in the answers to the multiple-choice quizzes don't exist in any English dictionary -- you will only understand them if you can guess what French term inspired the bad translation. The pace of lecture-hall-style discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you don't understand French.These technical and minor content issues are unfortunate, because the core content i s really quite good.",3
"Not what I was expecting as part of the program at all. Being more a visual learner I had a very hard time with how the math was covered in this in the course, I need a slide that is specifically V is XXXX, R is XXXX so I have a reference point and I found with most examples given I was having to go back and forth between multiple items and transcripts to gt what I needed. The other thing that I think would have helped me would have been less presenting and maybe a couple of quizzes for knowledge checks vs the pause and think items that were included. I did like Scott's humor, or at least humor attempts overall and I think a live class with him would be better than video. Additionally I felt that the course was a bit out date already, it was recorded in 2015 and I think I would have liked it more if had only been a year behind vs. a year and a half.",3
"It is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about UNIX and the GPIO pins. I missed reading material, since the videos are too short for learning something in a deep way.",3
it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.,3
There is a pretty big jump from the content to actually completing the assignment. The assignments are not well aligned with the swirl learning or the videos. There is no logical process taught about how to move forward if you get stuck. It often means a student is forced to search the internet and hope the answer they find is appropriate so they can write their own code.,3
"While I really enjoyed the first module, I was less impressed by this one. Have the course is very basic, while the rest is just too brief and not practical enough. I will however continue with the courses and expect the next module to build on the one reviewed here.",3
"While this course, tackled the core problems in dealing with intercultural communication, the videos and case studies were confusing to me.",3
"I would have enjoyed it more if I had had enough knowledge to do the Honors quiz!I downloaded all the videos so I could play them over without chewing up my data, but the quality is so poor you can't always make out the writing - i's and j's all look similar. It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !",3
that's good,3
well organized but need more assignments and practical assignments,3
there were mistakes in the quizzes.,3
"Still a very interesting course, but a few technical problems with test and forums.",3
Course can be more comprehensive.,3
Will knowing the stages of emerging technologies help in the real world applications? There is no conclusion if knowing accomplishing anything.,3
"the course is great but i have problem with the assignments as they all have to be in parts and i can't get why we only submit last part as if it is right the others is right also, i didn't like the assignments system in this course but the course and the assignments itself were great",3
"Good course. Introduces the basics well with a good emphasis on the underlying math. Bayesian techniques are missing. Also another suggestion : assignment submission in other languages , especially R - the industry language for prototyping ML algorithms.",3
Mostly useful practical advice and examples on how to use Excel to model risks and realities. Week 3 was not very good as it was a quick overview of basic statistics which is incomprehensible if you have no previous knowledge and useless if you do.,3
I did enjoy the course enough to see it through but it could use help on presentation correlation of lessons and tests,3
A fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer. Good illustrations. I would have liked to have known more of the overall value (if any) of the Jewish contribution in the context of Chinese economic development i.e. was it of any overall importance- did it make any difference? Is it still relevant?,3
A good course. Thank you.,3
"This was a decent introduction to R, but my main issue is that the Data Science specialization is so dependent upon the R language. This course really should be more focused around Python or be more flexible in general.",3
The course gave a good introduction but with little proofs or derivation.,3
"The content of the course is reasonable and gives an introduction to the uninitiated. The peer review sysetm however relies on the experience and knowledge of others which is a flaw in how some of the coursera modules are evaluated.If you are looking to expand your technical knowledge, opt for a course the has an automated test system (such as the courses on Data Structures and Algorithms).If you are just considering studying engineering, this course and specialization will be a decent and simplistic introduction into the field.",3
More detailed insight of topics is required is what I felt. On the whole a great resource to the student community who want to start their microcontroller exploration through Arduino.,3
"The teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic, not a lot or engagement. Indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping, on how it is fought and it is adopted. Worth it if you have a strong interest in sports.",3
"The interface of the classes is too straight, not very flexible. It almost looks like a real classroom, which isn't good in case we're at home learning by ourselves. Still, it has a very good content.",3
"It is not clear enough for a greenhand to understand, especially about installing Git on Mac or pushing files to Github.",3
Very basic introduction to financial markets.,3
The material is fine but the course isn't taught well. The instructor tends to start talking immediately in subject jargon and abbreviations without first giving students an intro or explaining foundation material first. It seems a lot of material is left out of the lectures and slides on purpose and forces students to buy the instructor recommended text book (which is also authored by the instructor). After each lecture I'm forced to Google search a lot of what was mentioned before I even understood half of what the instructor was talking about. I didn't pay to listen to something that forces me to Google search everything.,3
"This course targets mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago. Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts. What didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course. But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people. They were really motivating and inspiring!",3
"good, but need to pay to attend test",3
"The content of the course is very good, but the definitions and explanations are not straight forward.",3
"I enjoyed this course very much. Had value. I watch Scandinavian TV and films from the U.S. via Netflix, Amazon and MhZ Choice via livestreaming. In the future I would like more emphasis on recent or current Scandinavian film including actors, actresses, cinematography techniques, etc. Also, the video lengths were fine but the presenters need to be trained and give more engaging, lively presentations --- a bit too classroom ""lecturish"". Thank you!",3
"Wish there will be some lab assignments, for example doing some real work on AWS.",3
Couldn't hear the videos,3
"This course shares a lot of valuable information but could use a good deal of refinement. I really would have liked to have seen downloadable PDFs with the diagrams representing different models so that I could easily go back and reference them without having to find the particular moment in a video where it was shown. I also wish the videos were designed with better instructional strategies--the best Coursera courses (like those from Northwestern's Kellog School of Management) introduce material, expand on it, and then summarize the most important parts in each video--this helps the learner Here the learner is on their own. There's a lot of great information to pick up on, but some retooling from the UVA Darden School of Business would be greatly appreciated improvement.",3
Very much a straight lecture course of rather difficult material.,3
"This course is about computational neuroscience, it is not easy, and it requires knowledge and passion of mathematics and biophysics of neurons. If you are just interested in neuroscience but it is not your specialty (like me, a medical student), then this course is not beneficial for you.Prof. Segev is so knowledgeable and I think he tried his best to make easier but as I said it is difficult if you are just interested.",3
good and useful content but some problems in vids,3
A few helpful tips but most of the stuff seemed like common sense.,3
A bit too theoritical,3
Its informative and easy for beginners,3
Very basic introductory course. Looking forward to the other modules.,3
The videos are so long in time and not very clear.,3
"The course is interesting, the professors are good, they know how and what they have to explain. But the exercises and tests are really easy and do not require lots of knowledge. In fact, seems more like an explanation than a test. So, if you don't practice by yourself you won't learn a thing. Even though Coursera give you an certificate.I would add more and better practical exercises to make this course better.",3
"I would give it a 3.5, with the extra 0.5 because of the great interaction, ease of use, and clarity of progress. It was pretty hard for me and I barely made it in under the deadline (jumping session to session to complete). You definitely need some R background by the end for the project. I expected to get more in information in using R for inferential statistics too... though there was a presentation and each lesson had followup for use in R. Great use of examples for each section. That helped me a lot.",3
"Course was pretty boring, repetition of Digital Marketing previous modules, would appreciate it more if the professor did a better presentation!",3
Very helpful information particularly in the earlier weeks. I found the last couple weeks less helpful because of the large quantity of listed interventions without elaboration/examples - I did read the attached report but would have found it helpful to see some of the interventions demonstrated either via a video or diagram. Temple Grandin is a great documentary and I appreciated hearing her perspective regarding tactile sensitivity. She's also a great example of a person with autism who has developed her strengths and worked around her weaknesses and is a highly functional and successful individual. Overall enjoyed this class. Thanks!,3
It should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications.,3
Some quiz questions ask about material that is not discussed until later lectures. Some quiz questions are vaguely worded. Course seems under construction - many later lectures unquizzed?,3
"Although better than the previous course, it still was not very insightful. I wanted to know the components of the Integrated plan and not how someone was successful. Majority of the class was just copy from Stokes book. You can take that book and learn it yourself. The style of teaching does not really challenge or give insight.",3
"It is a really interesting course, it refers to the general public, with smart tips and quick recipies. Also, for those who know nothing about the sience part of lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements, in generall, it constitutes a very informative ''package'' for everyone. There is no specialaization in this kind of coures us I expected, because I am a food technologist, I kwnow most of the parts, but still it is really helpfull and interestin! Verry good job!",3
"There was a lot to try to remember from one quiz to the next and I have memory problems, but if you're a person with normal memory abilities, I guess that wouldn't be a problem. I really enjoyed learning more about ancient Egypt.",3
Somewhat basic and not very applicable,3
A bit fast paced as they teach so many things in a single week. But the stuff they teach is surely great and makes you appreciate the beauty of R,3
"Nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes, to get you to use the skills",3
"Too basic, if you're not completely unfamiliar to the subject.",3
"I guess may be good if you've never done introspective exercises before. The quizzes tend to focus on irrelevant details from the videos (probably something to do with the instructors focus on ""observation"" which seems to mean trying to remember all irrelevant details). I'm hoping that as this specialization moves beyond introspection to interacting with others, it will get better.",3
"I really like it. The course was a bit to short, but still I managed to learn few new things. It was definitely interesting plus interviews with well know people is a huge plus. Keep up a good work!!!",3
This course was a challenge. Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures. I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all. It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.,3
"Course quality went downhill, compared to previous course in series. No 'teacher' involvement in comments / questions. Mistakes within quizzes. Both practice and rated.",3
"The Course itself is fun. The videos are enjoyable. The subject matter is great. However the quizzes are way to hard. They ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class, and does not have access to. For that it becomes frustrating. Especially that the material is not easy to digest.",3
There should have been more examples and more use case and more applied rather than just a theoretical discussion,3
"The final negotiation homework was very interesting, and useful in internalizing the concepts. I didn't like the fact that the course spent a lot of time covering legal topics. Perhaps due to the instructor's legal background. I wish there were practical recommendations on salary negotiation.",3
"The course contains some interesting insights on writing a scientific paper. What I like about the course is that it is given by graduate students. But this is also a drawback. Sometimes, the material seems too simplistic.",3
The course is fine but very short videos and lack deeply explanations.,3
"it is very nice course, and improve my english writting style",3
kind of boring and I am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry,3
"It is good, very basic course giving the overview of the most important subjects in project management. Good as a starting point.",3
Steep Learning Curve. Swirl exercises are important for this course,3
I do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database.,3
"I'm new to Business Strategy, with previous background in Engineering. The course seriously lacks notes and proper definitions of the concepts. You will have to do your own research to understand the definitions. Also, you are expected to review 3 other projects. When you are a student yourself, how can you be expected to fairly grade your peers? I'm really not sure how useful this is going to be towards actually using it. I mean, will an employer find this useful? I don't know.",3
"Very informative, but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because there's not many specific examples provided. It is still a very enlightening course. PS You definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with Differential Equations to take this.",3
"A few of the programming projects were a bit tedious. If you're not passionate about games like tic tac toe, it's hard to maintain focus :) I love the teaching however, very well done as usual!",3
"In itself interesting content, structure was difficult to follow and the history - in my humble view - was going back too far into the past whereas more recent developments where only touched at the surface, quality of slides was poor.",3
"The professor lecturers were great! I enjoyed watching the his videos. However, theres's still room for some improvement. For example, I would add /more/ technical info at the video slides and also a /lot/ of literature related to IoT and embedded systems.",3
"Switching back and forth between Linux and Android is going to be problematic. It adds an unnecessary complexity to the course and adds extra skill set requirements which were not mentioned as needed ahead of time. While they say you can choose one or the other, later lessons will only use one or the other (it switches) and this causes issues if you actually intend to follow along and learn something.",3
"This might be just a personal opinion, the tips given in this course are rather intuitive. I happen to use the techniques explained in the course because they simply seem logic. Still for unorganized people it will be useful, and is clearly and well presented.",3
"This Course is very interesting because it covers the work from iconic photographers since its invention in 1839 to these days. The ""but"" I found is : first, the required readings are very extensive, and second , the questions for the quizes are most of them too much specific, and there are so many photographers names that it is quite a challenge to have more than five questions right. Otherwise, it is a captivating MOOC, designed more for Photographers than lay public.",3
The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data. The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data. I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first.,3
Exercises for Scikit-learn users were not organised.Course took too long to start,3
The course is pretty good for a beginner.But it emphasis too much on using third party authoring tools and proper coding is not implemented.The required code is auto-generated and we as learners are only asked to make few changes on the already existing code.,3
"While this course has great content, it lacks interactivity, exercises, peer learning opportunities and leaves desiring more real-life use cases and examples.",3
"There are some good tools to use, but the information presented it really just an overview and there isn't much substance to it.",3
The teacher explains concepts very well. Really worth the time to go over the lectures several times.The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction. You have to guess what the assignment is about each time.Overall very good lectures but poor assignments.,3
for me too much graded questions - but in generall the course is good,3
I really like the visiting writer seminars -- they were the best part,3
"I enjoyed this course very much. Thank you for offering this course for folks like me who need an introduction to Project Management. Although it was extremely helpful to put my learning into practice and do the work, I found the peer reviews difficult to assess. When reviewing the work of my peers, some of the information did not flow as a project as a whole. For instance, sometimes the WBS did not match with the project activities sequence, but because the rubric/peer review was so broad, as long as the peer put down 10 or more activities, he/she received a perfect score. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of ones full understanding of project management with the given rubric. I suggest creating a more detailed rubric that helps bring all the information together where those doing the peer review and those creating the documents can see the value of each part of the assignment. The assignment should essentially match the rubric to ensure accuracy of grading.Thank you again for this opportunity to take your course!",3
Covered basic elements of data science and statistics.,3
"Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated. For example, it doesn't cover the update version of github website and how to use it. That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing. Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment. It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for.",3
"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.",3
The class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potential.The Good:-The spreadsheets and exercises along with Quiz material. The project was also very informative.The Bad:- The video need to better explain how Area Under Curve and how the Credit model make sense. It was not very intuitive and I struggled for over 2 weeks to put the Project together due to this gap.But a worthwhile class with great potential. I am glad I took it.,3
"The course being concentrated exclusively on the design ideas of United States, it's quite literally ""some ideas from the history of graphic design"". Some of the choices for the contents of the course were, from the continental point of view, rather odd, though that did not make them any less interesting. As a summary: the course was interesting enough to be passed through.",3
very simple and basic ideas of growing a business. case studies are a little bit outdated.,3
The best course so far (though that's not saying much). This course would be better as a follow up to an example workflow showing an end to end analysis.,3
"Very basic, decent information.",3
"While the lectures were good, this course had annoying issues, such as in-video questions asking us to refer to previously shown material (which isn't easy given the Coursera interface). A few assignment questions were also poorly formulated. The course would have really benefited from .pdf reference material, for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures. At minimum, a list of relevant equations would have helped.The acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and hand-wavy; the assumptions and limitations behind the rule-of-thumb equations and models presented weren't given much weight, so I wasn't able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant*. The electronics part was more reasonable, but still suffered from some over-simplification (for example, the model of guitar pickups didn't include magnetic hysteresis).All in all, the course was worth taking, but I think the material deserves more rigor.*All models are wrong. But some of them are useful.",3
interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.couple of problems during the quizzes. An update is needed!,3
"It is a good course, but if you want to hand on the assignments, you have to pay. So I am a little disappointed.",3
"not using scikit and assigment way too easy, not challenging, but high quality video, very easy to understand .",3
The class and the content is very good! But the way that the professor teachs is kind of boring for me.,3
"Great subjects and some great teachers. But every now and then I missed some proper explanations.Further, reverences to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well.",3
A very interesting course and a good introduction to the topic. Would be beneficial if one could gain official credits or points towards an online degree with an expanded/more in-depth course volume.,3
"Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond.",3
The instructor is very dry and the mat,3
In general I like the course but I find it a bit boring. I wish it was organized in a more interactive way.,3
"Some sections were rather basic, lacking insight on some topics. It may be suitable for people with incipient engineering knowledge but for the slightly trained a bit repetitive. Still, the lectures were quite entertaining and the approach taken remarkable didactic.",3
Quite easy for me,3
difficult for people without accounting background to take.,3
"Focused too much on SQL rather than Python, so not really that helpful for people who already know SQL (like myself)",3
"A good introduction to Workplace Communication.The resources supplied were extremely helpful.I didn't pay so much attention to the slides that came with this - in fact, I'm not even sure how relevant they are looking back.I had expected the overview videos to be an insight to the resource content, but it wasn't quite compiled that way.The tests could have been longer, and perhaps could have contained obvious solutions - in some instances the solutions provided were all applicable, leaving the student to select the best option. In other instances the options available weren't even discussed in the content, confusing the student.",3
I really enjoyed the presenter who was engaging and interesting. I didn't enjoy the podcasts.,3
It is a very light course!,3
I definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe TED Talks as well.Great books on communication were written by William UryGetting to YesGetting to Yes with yourself (essential book)Beyond Reasonhttps://www.amazon.de/Getting-Yes-Yourself-Worthy-Opponents/dp/0062390678/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1479132707&sr=8-6&keywords=William+ury,3
The course isn't that hard but there is a lot of content to assimilate.,3
The Professors and the lectures were excellent. Homeworks are way to easy. Would like to use open source tools like pandas and sci-kit learn instead of proprietary tools like graphlab.,3
Good insight into marketing analysis and the use of R,3
"The whole eco-system is based on Graphlab create which is not very commonly used in the industry. The ""Programming assignments"" are very much like the exercise done in the videos - so no real thought and effort were needed. The Deep learning part is really bad thought and bad examined.",3
"It's ok; worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation. Overall I enjoyed it and it was good as a hand-hold through the pre-Socratics and some of the most essential Platonic writings.Pros: the videos are pretty easy to understand, and the material chosen/covered is good to know.Cons: the video quiz questions are really...dull...and there are too many. A downside of the ease of the videos/lectures is that they don't really go that in depth, and they're nowhere near the quality I've seen in other Coursera courses (like the Kierkegaard course from UCopenhagen).",3
assignments could have been a little tougher with more emphasis on coding.,3
The course was tough and was explained in a very fast way assuming that the student knows prior statistics.,3
"Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong does an amazingly thorough and detailed job, and the progression of the course is well planned and well executed.I wanted to give the course a higher rating, but unfortunately, the good doctor's explanatory skills only served to confuse and frustrate me, the further I progressed through the course. Extemporaneous examples were unintentionally and unnecessarily muddled. There were numerous misspoken or confused terms that could easily have been re-recorded or edited. And the splicing between the old course and the new one is sometimes discontinuous (though, to be fair, they warn us about that at the beginning).Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a thorough-going university-level course in critical thinking, and basic argumentation.",3
A very informative course that will definitely help you to excel in your professional field.,3
"It's too easy. I'd have enjoyed more challenching exercises about RESTful APIs, we have not seen any HTTP mehotd a part of GET and that's a shame.",3
"There are no notes for the course and the structure is quite loose. There are no assignments besides a final app. The time frame is difficult to keep up with, if you're not a full-time student. You'll spend time looking stuff up and re-running videos. If you've never had a course using Xcode, this will be a steep-learning curve.",3
"This is strictly for beginners. If you have had little hands on experience in Python, you may not find it that useful, though it's good to rehearse a bit. Also this course was on Python 2, so try to identify the differences between 2 and 3. One concern is that Python installation steps are covered in every week's classes which is redundant one.",3
There were a number of different instructors and it was great to have a taste of varying topics from them.,3
"I recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only. I was very upset with the programming assignments - they are few, they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient.",3
"Only include very basic contents, doesn't need 4 weeks to finish this course. More like a one or two day induction session.",3
I think the teacher has opportunity areas in terms of keeping the audience engage...,3
"good , but elementary ( undergrad level)",3
"It was a great specialization - enough detail while still being high level and pretty clear and easy to follow. I was sad that they ditched the last two courses though - was really looking forward to them, and the specialization feels really incomplete without them.",3
"a little dry and boring,but it's very useful",3
"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here.",3
"Should include recent material. A reference book from 2001 is very out of date, especially in the software world.",3
Good vibe but way too easy.... even for beginners! I am no beginner but I finished the whole thing in less than an hour.... Not much learned,3
Very basic,3
It's quite a simple course. What I was impressed was the supplementary reading linked to an online article - you are not doing things by saving time but the time will save itself if you,3
"Thank you for the course.With all my respect to authors, I have something to say:I beleave all 4 cources in the spesialization could be combine to one. Looks like authors may invest more time and passion to it. I just skipped all videos with Parham Aarabi.",3
"This course is very interesting, and everything is there should be known to start a business.But basically, it just says to respect everyone and everything. This course lacks some content. It repeats itself. It says the same things over and over again, just in different words.It's still a very good course, and it motivates you doing to do something with great values.",3
Good way to refresh your knowledge about PMP .. but not qualifying as a professional course,3
"Not all the DSDs were useful, and some of the content is very dated (such is the nature of a MOOC that isn't maintained), but it was useful to learn about methodologies and tools to think creatively about issues and solving problems.",3
I didn't like very much the two teacher,3
Good information for the absolute novice in time management.,3
"The content of this course is excellent, and I've learned a tremendous amount. It would be a 5-star course if that were the only criterion.I've become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes. A standard practice for students in online courses, if a quiz can be taken more than once, is to take the quiz before studying the material. (This is a research-supported study technique; it focuses attention on key points in listening/reading.) I'm finding that the questions virtually give away the answers. On my trial-run attempt, before the videos, I score close to or above the passing level. Because the multiple-response answers are immediately visible, a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked. I can usually achieve a score of 100% on three attempts before seeing any of the material.Questions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles, or by requiring true recall (typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format). There are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge; I'm sure you know and practice many of them in your face-to-face classes.The option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated -- and in the multiple response questions, this means that the correct answers have also been shown. A person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score 100% in a maximum of 4 attempts at the quiz, just by trying each answer on each question. Thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledge.The assignments do require a demonstration of some ability, but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that, in conjunction with quiz scores, they pass and receive the certificate for the course.This certificate program has high visibility in social media right now; it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not, in fact, indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skill.It may be that the Capstone project is graded quite rigorously, so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate -- but that's a bit devious too.",3
"Yeah, this course is REALLY different from other MOOCs. I wonder if I can learn anything from a course that contains such little content.",3
The content of this course is good but the production quality of the videos are not vary high.,3
"Good basic understanding. However the professors can be a bit more professional, sometimes it feels like Im a high school student again, the way they explain things.",3
Topics about Supply & Demand were interesting.Rest was too much theoretical for me. I would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examples.Design of the presentations could be improved as well.,3
"This was a little light, despite the fact that this is not my area of expertise. It was a goo start overall, tho.",3
"good content, but slow pace. tiny increments per week",3
Thanks!,3
Good but many problems with platform... and help center not easy to access,3
concepts were very good but teaching method/material must improve...some of the materials and methods used are too unstable to be useful for professional use...more work should be done by instructors to separate the 'reliable' concepts/info from 'interesting to know but not ready for mass use',3
"This is a good course. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it was very general for me. But, for undergraduates and beginners, this is a good introduction and for them I would rate it 4 or higher. One suggestion, make this course a little harder by introducing some numerical problems or making the course with some more depth. I would reccomend these course to almost all freshmen and sophomores as essential to building good financial skills for their future.",3
"The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other course do give).",3
"I did like the course BUT when you make the ""exercises"" and post something on the forums... OMG... Huge mistake... you start getting replies of EVERYTHING so... you can have 20 emails a day because other people are doing their ""exercises"" and posting on the forum, the worst is that is no way to turn off those....",3
"Good general guidance, Richard Sellers was the most useful. Interesting how even established in a career can be considered a ""generalist"".",3
More interactive and dynamic videos would be bett,3
"I am finding it very difficult to follow, feel like I am missing a chunk of information. However I will say that everyone else seems to be managing so it is probably me missing something",3
"The lecture is clear, but it's a fundamental lesson which could not learn many things, just theories. Furthermore, I suggest that there should be solution hints for Quiz, because students will be frustrated by not knowing the answers and not knowing how to fix them. In addition, the discussion broad is a little bit cold and lack of mentors to help students.",3
"Good frameworks that make a foundation. This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill. And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it. However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience. But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place. If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already. Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations. Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process. I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig. So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities. In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.",3
I gave the feedback to the detailed survey by the University of Michigan. I enjoyed the course but I would like some more guided work before facing the assignments. I think the professors can elaborate better the course,3
The sound volume is very low,3
"decent enough but this is a heavy subject and really it is not that interesting although clearly necessary. I feel maybe it could have been organized better to make it more interesting Also reading some of Haldey wickhams book he deliberately keeps this part of Data Science away from new learners as it can be a bit dreary, so my recommendation would be to do some of the other courses first.",3
"I would expect less mistakes in english. It would make a better impression.The course content was well-thought and well-balanced, the professor had a great way of presenting the material, but the english language part needed some editing.",3
"It is perfect for beginners, but if you're an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging.",3
"before discussing genetic mutations occurred in Alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing AIS, i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseases.some arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses, go onthanks for your efforts dear professors",3
"On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course. Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality.A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion. Hope it will help you for future improvements of the course and/or other offerings.Ricardo Oliveira",3
Interesting overview on the topic.,3
the course seemed to be more geared to artists/composers than technicians wishing to expand or futher their skill set,3
"Good intro - I'm learning a lot. But in the end I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces. One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me. So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments. This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Or even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.",3
"Pretty weak teaching - ""maybe you can place objects in this order, or maybe in this order"". No any clear logics.",3
"The most weak part is automatical grading. When structure and semantics are essential, text inside tag is not, guessing if exists space between elements isn't acceptable as well. Also it's difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field. Better to use file uploading with required snippet. For me also not enough accent was on html 5 features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes.",3
"Good introduction, but the professor could have been more descriptive about how to use git/github. These are new concepts for people so it may be difficult to grasp right away.",3
An interesting course. Could do with a bit of a technical overhaul as it feels a little clunky in terms of access to course materials and technical structure. Overall well presented and excellent content.,3
"3.5 - Good, but I feel some of the explanations were over complicated a little compared to other coursers such as openintro to stats. Overall good experience though",3
"This course is very helpful to motivate oneself to create a website. But it looks like the authors themselves made the course in one weekend. The lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments. Some videos don't show what the lecturer is talking about, maybe there is bug or something, but there is only some irrelevant picture. The due dates are inconsistent through different pages. Finally, the next day after the course ends I am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment, even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible.",3
"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
"I missed more details and exercises on the last part of the course. For example, that geoload/geodump/where-data could be given as exercises during the course and joined at the end to make that map solution.",3
"no discussion forum and verified certificate, hence the 3 stars only. Prof Adelstein's analogies and video lectures are amazing otherwise",3
"Course feels somewhat abandoned by instructors. Content is okay, but can't help the feeling that it's basically a cash cow - students would benefit a lot if instructors were move involved.",3
"A very basic overview on Data Science. You learn how to use git, rstudio, and other tools though. The other courses of the specialization are way better.",3
"As a beginner, this cours is greate",3
"As for the Statistical Inference course, this course is amazing but is presented in a more complex way than it should be. Once again the concepts are simple and the math not so hard, yet I had to do a lot of research outside the course to be able to understand these simple concepts and derive the not so hard mathematics.Brian Caffo is clearly brilliant and, I would say, seem to be a good lad too, but something is missing. Too often the details are thrown at us without being properly framed in the context or without having the proper concept being introduced progressively.I have a theory about teaching since I was 15, and so far it has proven to be true. Imagine that learning is about climbing a mountain in which tall steps have been carved. Each step is taller than the student. The teacher is somewhere higher than the students (not necessarily at the top, if there is such a thing).The job of the teacher is to throw boxes (concepts) and balls (details) of different size, shape and colors. The job of the student is to catch these boxes and balls and to put the right balls in the right boxes in order to make a staircase out of it to climb (at least) one of the giant stair up.A good teacher makes sure to throw the concepts first than the details and to clearly specify which balls go into which box, as well as which boxes go inside/over which other boxes.But most teacher simply throw the balls and boxes in an not so well structured manner, so the poor students try to catch as many as he can, but also miss a lot of them. His hands can hold a limited amount of balls. If he doesn't have the right box to put them, he would either miss the next balls, or put the one he hold in his hand in the wrong box.Bottom line, the best teachers are those who focus on the concepts (and context) and make sure that the concepts are well understood before introducing details to stuck in these concepts. From my experience our brain (or at least mine) better learn this way. It is as if our brain need first to establish a category-pattern (the concept/context) to which it will associate detail-patterns. But without a proper category-pattern, our brain is having a hard time to properly remember the detail-patterns or miss-associate them to the wrong category-pattern (which create even more confusion).Hope it was helpful somehow...",3
"That was a pretty good introduction on how various systems work, together with a nice practical tutorial. However, the delivery has ENORMOUS potential for improvement... for now it's just slides with an extremely impassive voiceover. There are so many good ways to engage with the learner and yet none of them have been employed here. After doing a great Deep Learning course by Google on another platform, this one was a huge disappointment in that regard.",3
It seemed to me that it is a good introduction for someone totally new to the topic.,3
I think Punctuacion is the main topic,3
Good but can be long due to accompany material,3
"Although the course covers interesting subject areas, I feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth. I understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me. But overall, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the course.Also, the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code. But these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course.",3
It's good till now.,3
"I love the content overall. However, I'm very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all. Ironically, I could find some old video lectures of this course on YouTube. The difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques, such as the Fitch system.Hopefully you can add video lectures back to this course.",3
"The course is good for elementary understanding, th exercises were fun too. However, the tools could have been described",3
It's a very basic course with little technical overview. The history and story of emergence of internet is described.,3
Basic content that do not explain how business models are applied in digital world,3
"pace is slow. so many video in pieces, and lecturers keep saying like"" we will look into more details later"" or introduction again and again. I am studying module 2 now, all small lectures like 1 min or 2 mins, which is very shattered, repetitive and annoying.",3
"Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations.",3
"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an ""Obligatory"" lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual ""training"" on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of ""Follow Along"", but it really felt rushed and more of an ""Obligatory"" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me.",3
"The course material is OK; the lectures are fun and interesting, but to pass the course you need to submit an assignment that is subjected to peer review and you will need to get approval by all of your peers. However the act of subscribing to a MOOC alone does not make people suited to review other peoples work...",3
Its a really great project but one needs to have studied mechanical and really advanced level physics to do this project. But I really got help of the discussion forums to complete the assignments but am not yet clear about the theory of aerial robotics.,3
"This is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition. For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition, most of this course may be a review for you but there's some good information and facts to take away. I wish the instructor had a little more training/skill in the cooking segments (e.g. basic knife skills she said don't cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong, using the knife to point at different ingredients).",3
"Really just an overview of the topics to be explained in detail afterwards.Big plus for the use of python + notebooks but otherwise, if one is interested just in the overview and not in all the specialization, maybe the Andrew NG course is more detailed.",3
"The Course is fine, explanations and videos are a bit hard to follow at times.The final assessment is in my opinion very bad, as it i appears to me quite unrelated to the course it self. The lectures are quite abstract and the exam is a practical application of the concept.The instructions of the course also aren't very good as you need to do each part of the final project at the end of each week.I would strongly suggest to not take this course unless you have many spare hours.",3
"The course is good, but it doesn't really offer all the tools required to pass the exams. I had to take extra courses in other place in order to pass. In addition, the exams some times become a bit too subjective of what the classmates want to grade you.",3
"I must say that the information on writing in the course was good, and the example of sanding, giving a critique etc. was very useful to me as a writer just putting her work into the world. I was extremely disappointed that after laboring through 3 long stories, only one formatted in the way the course specified, and trying to write at least one page of comments on each that what I got in return was on good critique and two that were only two lines long. I was on scholarship so I did not pay for the course but it was disappointing that there was no moderation of the peer review side of the homework.",3
"Overall, this is a good subject.However, some slides are not well organized.Many questions in assignment are too tricky.",3
"The course is interesting.The peer-review assigment and grading system is the weak park of this course : you are asked to do a prototype in one week that must be reviewed ""pretty epic"" from the other students for the highest grade.",3
this course need some odifications because of cloudera version,3
I enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking Buddhist concepts with psychology; I just found some of the videos a little dry.,3
Very basic,3
"I have seen reference to the previous second course on the specialization, 'Functional Reactive Programming in Scala', comparatively this one looks much easied down, I am hoping to find the excluded content on the third course. Sessions by Erik surely are a 100% pertinent and consistent within the full syllabus they were conceived for, but inserted here they break a bit the overall discourse, in my view. Got the feeling that the exercises cover only a little part of the theoretical content exposed in the lectures.",3
"Good course, but very high-leve",3
very difficult with lots of math not properly explained. What's the point of learned all these formulas by heart if you cannot use the properly because that is not explained well.,3
The Good:Very palatable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learning.More reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first Arduino course of the series.The Bad:Not worth the money when looked at generally. The first and second course could easily have been merged. A lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught.,3
"The content of this course is not self-contained. You need to search and read extra materials to fill some knowledge gaps. Besides, some of the videos are missing and some quiz are not well clarified. Well, given all the complaints, the instructor is of no doubt one of the best in this field. The topics in this course is worth exploring using your own time.",3
Though at a high level but I did like the contents and the deliver format which is easy to understand.,3
"Although it delves into key elements of trading where it really matters, course lacks explanation on some subjects. Course progresses monotonously.",3
"The course content itself was good, however the final assignment was vague and confusing. I think my coursemates had the same problem; all of the submissions I reviewed failed to discuss in any way at least one of the learning objectives.",3
"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple",3
WIsh there were more assignments. The final project was the only assignment in the course. Object-oriented programming in R requires more than a single assignment to grasp- even at a superficial level.,3
"The content of this course is very good. However I feel it is unfortunate that the lecturer did not make an effort in preparing the presentation of the material. This makes a huge difference. Especially when it is an online course, the lecturer needs to bring the story to life rather than simply reading with hesitation from the slides in most instances.",3
Could have covered more areas and with more examples for features. Not bad for what it is to serve as guidance.,3
"It is a good intro course to get set up with everything you may need for future courses, but it's not necessary if you are already a little familiar with github and R.",3
The content covers very good the most important theories and concepts in macro economy and explains in detail the relationship between them. I wish the course would take more advantage of interactive multimedia tools in order to support the spoken word with visual means.,3
"Good overview, but some of the content is just quickly mentioned and not put into practice. Give more room to use in examples, create action, tell stories. Some of the lecturers were just reading down the notes wer already see in front of us and were not finishing their sentences in an engaging way (sometimes they made comments in a very low tone) . Some of the sounds are not good quality (mono - just on one ear)",3
It is very good explained but it is just an small introduction about how to use the Raspberry Pi in a IoT framework.,3
The videos are great. The activities are fine. The final activity needs more structure/scaffolding.,3
Pretty short introduction to R.,3
I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.,3
"I feel like more examples, case studies, or panel interviews would help.",3
The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples. I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.,3
It's a good explanation about the technologies used on smartphones but it mote a comparison of what we had and what we have now. It's nothing really new and fundamental for this specialization.,3
Basic course with videos running too fast......,3
Super basic! The instructor goes super slowly and spends a lot of time on unnecessary stuff. Each video can be down in half the time,3
Can't easily understand one of the instructors. Dislike how it chops and changes instructors in the same course.,3
"The course was really great! The teacher explained excellent and the topics were very appropiate. However, when i finished the course i couldn't see the certificate of accomplishment at least; it never showed up :( And now when i click on the option ""Buy the course"" the page redirects me to an address which doesn't exist.Despite of this, I enjoyed this course a lot, as the first one! Thanks a lot!",3
Assignments flawed and need reviewing.,3
Very little content. Most of the value comes from working on games for the assignments.,3
"I think the quizzes could've been higher quality. Many of the images used in the quizzes were very confusing. Also, i think more character recognition instead of focus on pin yin would've been more beneficial",3
"THIS COURSE IS INTERESTING,INFORMATIVE AND USEFFUL. RIGHT NOW I AM HEADING TOWARDS END OF THE COURSE. IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS COURSE FOR EVERYBODY.",3
Difficulties streaming,3
"Really enjoyed the information and perspective from the course. The only issue is that everything is from the Israeli point of view - the course would benefit from some discussion/inclusion from other perspectives. Still, it gave me a good background on the issues, and I would take more classes from the same institution.",3
"My happiness went down after this course. Only positive thing was that i realized how messed up my life is.Overall its a interesting course, it is obvious that a lot of effort was made while creating it and you can definitely learn something from it",3
"This was a good course, but a bit elementary.",3
Clear and very interesting. But I don't think this course is adapted for people who never heard about coding.I liked you speak about accessibility and enjoyed making the quizz. Congrats !,3
"Good things:• Simple, clear concepts that serve as a foundation for further study of finance.• Many examples, repeated often to help gather basic ideas.• A pace that is easy to follow.• Friendly lecturer, even entertaining at times; which makes lessons fun to watch.• Helpful and kind teaching assistants.Not so good things:• Lessons alone don't teach you what you need; they don't even hint at some formulas that are necessary to pass the test.• Because of that, expect to find surprising problems and ideas on tests. You'll need to spend a long time working on them, probably attempt multiple times, and definitely visit the fora to consult with others.• Lack of assignments or already-solved exercises, similar to the ones used on the tests. There are only tests. Self-assessing assignments would be helpful to ""try"" the tests before actually attempting them.• The course is actually 5 weeks long (not 6 as stated, since there's an ""empty"" week). I doubt that's useful as the staff claim (I simply skipped one week and continued normally).• The professor insists repeatedly on a grandiose, philosophical, cheesy view of finance (how it'll make your life so much better, how it's applicable to so many aspects, how money isn't everything) but, in my opinion, betrays that spirit from day one by sticking to the most obvious applications and examples. He could, for example, show how these methods would apply to food supplies, barter, social prestige, trustworthiness, confidence in people or institutions, certainty about logic assertions, or other things that aren't measurable in dollars. He could use real-life examples (disastrous financial decisions in History, GDP of countries, international trade, loans taken by cities or countries, etc), and that would make it so much more engaging (I only remember one question about the price paid for the Manhattan island). He doesn't even use other currencies in examples nor tests.",3
Rather elementary and slow-moving for my taste. But the material is competently presented and covers the material it is advertised to cover.,3
It's really informative and helpful.I will definitely recommend it.,3
Inappropriate rating was done for me.,3
"The lectures are good and clear, with many concrete examples and exercices to train. The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse. I just don't dream of money all the time.The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available.",3
"Good ,but many complaints regarding PID tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions",3
"This course is good, although it repeats a lot from the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.",3
This course is the worst i have taken on coursera. They just want to mention everything in very short time. Quiz is much harder than material on video.,3
Poor structuring of assignments. Unclear objectives and wrong input data.Course Content was good.,3
Good idea for content and good content except poor support from Moderator. In fact zero support as far as I can see.First time I came across grading done by students - it's highly unreliable and not necessarily fair. It's halfway through the course and 2 out of 3 of my assignments haven't been graded because of other students not doing it.There is a requirement to use Adobe Illustrator which is a real pain if you've never used it before and the timescales are tight - it's a 4 weeks course with weekly assignments. Unsure why there is this endorsement for the Illustrator when there is other good and cheaper software avail. (Affinity designer for instance).,3
It was good but the examples could have been better and there could have been more material. But whatever syllabus was there in this course it was clearly explained,3
Good Work,3
"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.",3
"Very simple course instruction and materials with difficult programming assignments. I understand having a student stretch for an assignment, but this seems more like incomplete instruction. Definitely a lot of work if you only have a statistical programming background.",3
"too short, I prefer that the engineer share a little experience or make more in detail.",3
"This course is very instructive and well-paced like the others in the specialization. However the Raspberry PI ecosystem has evolved since the course materials were created. Although it's still possible to follow the videos, I think it would make it easier to update some things a little bit.",3
To much disconnect between assignments and lectures,3
"Overall, this is a good course. It provides many handy tools, frameworks, techniques for data-driven decision making process. It does improve my decision making skill. However, the course is quite short and doesn't have much in-depth content.",3
Could be more computer friendly. Had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them.,3
The instructor's lecture sounded too robotic and I feel like he didn't make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience. It feels like he just copied concepts and pasted them into the lecture and then read them quick.,3
I think that this course could have more content.,3
"Too slow, too vague, but you can feel the ideas behind have potential.",3
Great course for somebody who does not know anything about data science. When doing this specialisation there should be credit for those that did the other data science specialisation,3
This course really need examples in final assignment,3
"It's a great introductory course, although a bit superficial.",3
not a great amount of content,3
"Compared to other courses in the specification, this course content is too shallow and brief.",3
"Too much synthetic on very important parts, too much focused on graphlab",3
"A separate class for spreadsheets and modeling isn't bad perse. The best way to teach these models is to integrate them during finance or accounting, or whatever specific class you are trying to learn.That said this is probably a good resource for someone with 0 and I mean absolutely NO experience with excel. However my gut feeling also tells me that those who have had 0 experience with excel will not be able to follow the models shown in this class.",3
This was a great introductory course to graphic design. It made me think of many ways to represent the same image. I,3
Several errors in lecture and lack-luster assignments decreased my perception of value.,3
"Interesting, but the assignments were a bit dull. Learned a bit more about python.",3
"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.",3
Interesting introduction to the topic. Would be beneficial if the course could be expanded and a formal certificate could be obtained providing credits or official points.,3
This course covers important aspects of techniques used to solve popular problems. But it misses to cover introductory points in some modules (i.e: dynamic programming module) as well as the accent of some instructors isn't clear enough.,3
"Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.",3
Peer reviews was unfair. It's must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing. Blacklists is only one way to stop them now.,3
"The material was useful, and I learned a lot, but some of the specific lessons were presented in a confusing manner and it seemed like there was an overall lack of quality control (typos, missing videos, material presented in a confusing manner). As a PwC employee, I felt that with greater attention to the quality of the materials/lessons, this course could have presented the firm in a better light.More specifically, in those videos where the instructor typed out formulas for the first time, this could have been done more slowly and using magnification. This would make it very obvious how the formulas were being constructed. As it was, I found myself frequently rewinding and squinting at the screen.All that being said, however, I did feel that the course benefited me significantly, and I plan to leverage this knowledge in my work for PwC.",3
"The course content is great. It gives overview on what is going to be learned in details in the next courses. Considering that it is an introductory course and the fact that it utilizes the GraphLab library as tool, I believe it is overpriced compared to the other courses of the specialization.",3
The course touched just the basics of game design principles. Everything was mostly theory based without any practical examples. I was expecting some kind of other approach of teaching this kind of topic.,3
"I think the theory is too dense, but with a weak link with R. I understood better with swirl than with the videos. I'd suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations. They confused me sometimes.",3
"Went in a slow pace. Enjoyed the modules, especially final assignment.",3
"Would have welcomed more or longer lectures, and more variety in the assignments.",3
"A daily demanding course, which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas - particular signals. The video explaining a sample Signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted.",3
"Good learning materials, however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code, but it is algorithms. Yes, there is parallel code in the code of the assignments, but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code, while in my opinion it should be the other way around - you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you.",3
"A good course who teaches the way you have to do to write correctly a scientific paper, and gives an idea about the process of publish, it is useful and necessary for those who wants to continuous study and have their own work knows on the fields who works and research.",3
"It's a very basic introductory course. You can't actually expect much from this anyway. You really need to take the full course to evaluate if this is a great one. I did have learned something new but I'm not yet sure if it's useful or not. Guest speakers invited to this course do share some valuable ideas. For the main instructor, he's speaking really slow which can make you feel bored. However, it's reasonable when there is a big and varied audience on coursera because not everyone can hear a quick speech. I'm going to continue studying the course.",3
"I loved the course and content, but, found the process cumbersome. I think that some of these issues have now been addressed and should not present a problem in future programs.",3
"It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I would like to see more in-depth and technical material.",3
"The course is fine, but I would give the certificate out for free and charge for the ones that follow in the specialization as an incentive to enroll.",3
Few tools on Xls has been shown.More extensive and complex problem are required on use of Monte Carlo method,3
Some points were technical making a key understanding of how to present a resume,3
"In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice. It is a ""hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you"" but it is too introductory. And I know the course has the word ""Introduction"" in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content",3
It lacks of video lectures so I had to rely on notes only. The course's content is interesting and has potential to give learner more depth of topics. Hope it will be improved soon.,3
Simple and Easy way to learn English,3
"This course is a short introduction to JavaScript. Their is some useful information, that is very very interesting and easy to understand, but it is too little to understand JS.",3
"Interesting material and good teacher but very poor use of the media (an audio file would have been sufficient for most lectures) and low quality recording for some lectures (background noises, echos, wind...)",3
Course contents are not very well organized.,3
It's a good introduction to ML.,3
I have given an extra star for the free license software received.Didn't find the course as challenging as the Machine Learning course.The assignments need to be more challenging. Connecting to SQlite / GA Analytics dummy data can be added. Tableau with R session can be incorporated.,3
"The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was. I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful.Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture.",3
Very informative.,3
The class was good. The instructor is great and she is very knowledgeable. I just wish there were more content in the class.,3
"the presentation was needed to be change a little bit, to get the postive attention",3
"This course gave an overview of hiring and developing talent, but had far fewer actionable takeaways than the first course in the specialization. I found Cheri Alexander's sections to be extremely long-winded, unclear, and redundant. Also, I like the idea of mixing up the assignment format, but creating three movies is a lot to ask for a management course, especially when the same assignment could easily have been done in another format - it felt forced. Also, I found that the order for some lectures seemed off and the flow between instructors was not as seamless as it had been before. For instance, we were asked to create a development plan at the end of a week about hiring and before the week on development.",3
"The professor's view of Plato is unique and interesting. I would not recommend this as a first look at the Dialogues, however. Also, it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the remit of the course, to teach ""reason and persuasion"", in Plato's view. The course was more of a ""modern take on ancient questions"".",3
"Geared specifically to college professors, as opposed to general public. Could be more useful with more background information on ADA and IDEA and everyday implications. Could also incorporate mental illness and disability aspects.",3
"It is difficult to complain too much about a free course, but I expected more from a course carrying the name Princeton. The videos were generally well done and interesting, but did contain factual errors almost every week.Unfortunately the instructors were absent from the forums after a couple replies the first week. The homework assignments were disorganized, provided components contained errors, the grading system had problems and the requirements were often unclear. The assignments require Java programming experience (not mentioned in course description). Most importantly, the assignments in no way reflected what was taught in the course videos. They were of course related, but were implementing parts of a bitcoin node, but in a simplified manner. The textbook PDF is good.It would have been nice to have assignments working with real bitcoin (or testnet) transactions, sigs, verification, hashing, etc.Anyhow, I'm enthusiastic about this subject matter, so I'm just happy the course exists, but don't expect a glossy polished course... it's a rough ride.Here is another Bitcoin course that looks good: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/bitcoin-decentralized-technology",3
"The course was very interesting and thought-provoking. I found the introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formalism. The discussions highlighted exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty. However, I still do not feel I could propose convincing PGMs for real-world problems. There are examples in the course, but they are far removed from being concrete applications. I would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of PGMs in the literature over the lengthy programming assignments. I am an experienced programmer with over 5 years of experience in many languages including MATLAB/Octave and I sometimes found it uninspiring to solve toy problems, not due to the difficulty in using the programming language, but rather because after the assignment had been completed I felt I had not really learnt much more than I would have from just watching the lectures, although, if you are interested in getting experience with MATLAB/Octave, the programming assignments are good practice. I qualify this in stating that I have not yet completed the next two courses on PGMs; this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the upcoming courses, and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them",3
There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain. It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.,3
"A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models. I don't think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though. They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little, if any, thinking required. A bit disappointing from an institution like Wharton.",3
"A little bit too basic, I expected more.",3
"It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all. I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live. However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use.",3
"This course is more like a brief to ""how to design and launch a product into the market"" with a case study of an app targeting to aged population. I even felt like I was watching its commercial sometimes.",3
"too short and not very helpful for me, I was missing more details.",3
Important basics for people starting their Project Management endeavour.,3
The course was pretty good. Maybe concepts were illustrated too general and briefly (not in details) but maybe this course is just a warm up for people who are not specialists in those fields. Nevertheless it was quite fun to listen the lectures and that's why course went pretty fast. I only regret that there's no free Statements of Accomplishment.,3
"Overall a good course, with a section on Islam and Magic that felt very well elaborated. All peer graded exercises however were poorly designed and had awful correction criteria.",3
"easy to undestand, but it needs more examples",3
"It is informative, but there are many basics that were not covered well & there was a lot of information that was not that interesting (like too much history)",3
Lack practical aspect analysis. Most of the materials are more theoretical (some of the graphs are not necessary and does not help understanding the discussing topic and increases confusion. Eg: Lorenz curve.) Really enjoyed and learned a lot from the case study from reality. Highly recommend increase real-life case study materials.,3
Constraints were hard to understand even after re-watching the videos. I think more time could have been spent on the videos and more information could have been relayed to the students.,3
"A very basic overview of Egyptian history, not as detailed as I had expected. It didn't cover as many topics as I would have liked.",3
"I had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors. Swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly. I wish you guys could implement a little R interface so we can follow you closer.The last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time, if you do not have much experience. They could shorten a little the questions. I know that one takes to the other, but I only had time to finish the first and understand. Yes, perhaps I am not the best, but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmers.I think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors, matrix, data.frame, etc. separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities. We need to practice more, I like theory and I know how important, but I dont think that I learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part. I dont think it build my knowledge until I understand how to create that script for week4. I had to look around in all the internet, buying books. Read more. Just my opinion. I think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build that.Also has its positives, I really learnt great tips and technically I know a lot of R potential.",3
Decent introduction course.Without the rest it is useless in my opinion.So only take in case you want to follow the entire learning path.,3
It is a very light course!,3
"A solid overview of accounting and finance for the non-financial professional. I have 0 finance and accounting experience, so I valued how broad this course was and I imagine it's a good primer for more in-depth courses.",3
"The video quality was so bad, can not see the code clearly. Please update the better video.",3
"Interesting, but could be improved with further applications.",3
Good concise introduction for the topic.,3
"I really had a hard time understanding Dynamic Programming. I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses. I never heard of this topic before and the lecturer ommited many steps when explaining the Edit Distance. I was forced to look for other resources like Open Courseware Algorithms course, and this is how could understand what was dynamic programming easily. Hope this helps!",3
"Nice but lacking. Would like it to cover more content, specially around handlebars.",3
"The topics discussed into this course are really interesting. The videos give some perspective at the time of taking care of our own health and eating habits.The only problem I see, is the shortness of the course and the videos. The topics don't go beyond the surface and there is a lack of: details, examples, and comparisons between healthy diets and harmful ones.",3
"In my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module:1) Video Content: Making more dynamic, switch between explanations and slides in full screen. Only explanations, it is very tiring to attend the classes. The video would be ideal as shown in week 4 of this Mooc: How the hotel shouldnt work with Expedia? or video: How to hotel shouldnt work with Booking.com?2) Analysis requested: In the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level, it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area. In my case, I felt much difficulty because I do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry. And analyzing the exercise, I realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry. I left a comment on the discussion board stating that I was not feeling safe to do the exercise. However, there was no demonstration by the teachers of the course.In short, I was not feeling prepared, let alone analyze colleagues. The first time, did not get the minimum score. The second time, with the longest time, I could better perform the exercise. But rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories. I realized that those who examined me in the first and second time, had little or no idea about financial analysis. And another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze, was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do. With nothing to analyze, I did not think fair to give a low rating, so I preferred not to analyze. If the person left blank, something needs to be revised.When mounting a course, you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students: beginner, intermediate and advanced in the subject matter.The first week was not to have been given is analysis. It could have been the third or fourth week of this Mooc, so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed.3) Amount of content: Adding the video, quiz and analysis, are about 30 content. It is very tiring and little time for such content. Could decrease the amount of video and quiz, relocating to another week course or Mooc.4) Feedback: Teachers need to leave a contact way (facebook, twitter, etc.) and be active in Coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed.5) Notes: He missed the weight of the notes. I found a little confusing the allocation of notes.6) Curriculum: Missed curriculum (biography) of teachers. No contact information.7) Books: Missed suggestions of books in the hotel industry.Anyway, these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course. Thanks for listening.",3
"This is a good course, but being a professional in the software industry, I know many of the teachings described here. It was still a good refresher to have.",3
"The information, videos, links additional reading do provide important information. However this course is aimed at teachers and that is not clear from the title and much less with the small amount of articles that are related to teaching. This course also has lots of issues with its quizzes; getting no support from staff on technical matters or feed back on why a true or false questions is always wrong.",3
Longer than expected. You could move more of the content into the third section and balance the time commitment,3
i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams. One for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and R. I think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course.,3
"If you have absolutely no foundation of what the basics of business, then this is for you. It's very simple and direct, but make sure to follow this course up with lecture material that goes slightly more in-depth. I recommend U of Penn.",3
"After taking a Nordic food diet course where they talked about children's' diets in the Nordic countries and how they were changing the norm, this course covered the basics as to what and why certain foods are good for you. I had been hoping for more complex recipes, but there were some differences to my dishes that I already make which were a nice change.",3
"I liked that there were many practical exercises and it was talked about many crazy new technologies.Still, I feel that there was a lot of subtle publicity throughout the course and sometimes the focus was more on the promoting a brand than the lesson and knowledge itself (ex. 3dhubs, the professors lab, Daqri, ....).I understand that to understand better, we need examples, but I wonder if it could maybe be done in a different way.Nevertheless, I learned a lot.Thanks a lot for all the lessons!",3
Prefer more challenging course on this topic.,3
I need to have a class. I really think this course could hel me a lot.,3
"The course provides a number of very useful tips for researchers, especially those whose first language is not English. There are a number of useful guides for new researchers to learn how to structure, phrase, and approach academic writing. However, there are also a few shortcomings of the course. Some of the material is overly subjective (giving rules for academic writing that are not necessarily applicable). Many of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overly specific or simply incorrect (this is a very small percentage, but it is noticeable). The pace of the videos is also slow and oddly punctuated to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times. Finally, the course relies too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences, rather than taking a broader approach, so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching, as some advice may not be applicable to their own discipline.Overall, a recommended course for ESL academics, but could do with some improvement.",3
"Thanks for providing lots of interesting materials! As for me, i would prefer having more advanced tests and tasks as the given ones did not really help me remember the materials. I would also appreciate having some additional materials on the brain areas in this course, since this area was completely new to me.",3
The course content is good but sometimes very fast paced. The downside of the course relates to the peer-review system of some of the assignments. You can get stuck with a failed assignment for weeks and you have to kindly ask in the forums for someone to review it.,3
The course was an interesting way to explore writing models to explore climate change. The way the assignments are written was sometimes confusing.,3
"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework.",3
I learned some interesting Tools about Learning. I would love the course to engage us with more concrete Learning,3
An introductory course that seems like it should have been the first week of a more in-depth course instead of being a stand-alone course. The cost vs benefit of this particular course is questionable.,3
This is a good fundamental course. Colleen is a great teacher and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.,3
"It's a good course for those that are seeking to improve their grammar skills in English, but for me it sounded a little superficial and the peer review system for this course left space for some subjectivity.",3
The course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the videos and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples.,3
really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment. it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like,3
"I found that the momentum build in the first course of the ""Game Design and Development"" specialization was lost when going into Principles of Game Design. In my opinion the course became too focused on the theory, where it could have combined the learnings of ""Introduction to Game Development"" with the principles of game design in a 50/50 ish combination.However, if your sole purpose is the theory of games and game design, and you do attend the course in relation to the specialization, then by all means, it's a decent course.",3
"Focused a little too much on telephone history, though some was interesting. Perhaps spread out to other modules as short background material.Would have preferred history/overview from Internet age with focus on various protocols/technologies that were introduced (IP, TCP, UDP, MQTT, Thread, Bluetooth, ZigbeeModule 6 made up for its more dynamic and more germane presentation. May be make it the 1st module, with other modules going back for a brief historical overview",3
"HTML and CSS were well explained and clearly cover. However, some of the JavaScript was glossed over and very difficult to follow.",3
"As a standard overview, the course is fine. However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying ""fuck"" or ""sex"" even in an academic setting. Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere. The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - ""who published what when"" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how.",3
Interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the ML Specialization,3
Great assignments and bad videos.,3
Not enough repetition in the way of homework. Expected a more rigorous course.,3
"Good ""basics"" course. Great for beginners and reminders!I was hoping for something more advanced & was a bit disappointed. I am probably more knowledgeable than most however. The statement made regarding ""eating fruits & veggies regardless of whether they have pesticides or not"" was a bit tough for me as I became ill in part due to pesticides and still am. I might always be. I understand eating veggies in place of other foods (i. e. - processed foods) as I eat very little meat anymore. But coming from Stanford and someone as educated as he is, that was shocking. It makes me wonder who funded this course.",3
This course would work better if the material wasn,3
Great content- videos and assignments were fantastic.Little partecipation and interaction with staff and other partecipants makes the course lose a lot of its attractiveness- most of the concepts are not rocket science and one would really benefit from confrontation with other students.,3
"It was an interesting course, and some of the advices that have been given are quite useful. But I suppose it has no great impact on my lifestyle, as I have enough activity already. But for those who have really sedentary way of life is very helpful.",3
"Some good case studies and interesting content, but it's a 50,000 foot view of marketing. I was seeking a more technical and channel specific insights. This is much more conceptual and high level, so it was less useful for me.",3
Ok up to Module 3. Module 4 very convoluted.,3
"About: First Lessons contain some Interface/Questionnaire errors.Hi, I reckon it's a tad too early to rate this course since it is only going to start - but I didn't see another option to contact the Course Administrator other than trough the rating process.When going through the introduction of this course, there were multiple errors in the Quizzes/Q&A's. EG: On a question with 1 correct answer, the solution page would also show the clearly wrong answers as ""correct"" (or ""correct, well done""). There were several examples like this. It was only a bit confusing at start (this is my very first course on Coursera, maybe it's common thing to happen.)There was also no option in these videos to thumb-up or -down vote, or to report a problem, like I had seen on other courses.In my opinion the videos were well spoken and easy to understand, and they included everything one could think of when first considering to start playing the guitar. Only the beginning of the first video had a slight feeling of ""Ok, I'm a bit annoyed to do this now"" but that could easily be a misinterpretation or a strategy to capture interest. ;-)I do believe it's a good thing that T. shows all the possible extra's one can buy for a guitar, half of which no guitar player I know owns and which, all together would cost almost as much a beginner guitar, but I believe he omitted that guitar strings generally live longer when you clean the strings with a cloth where you touched them after playing. That's a good maintenance practice if you cannot afford to buy 2 sets of strings every month.Maybe a good addition would be that guitars/instruments can also be rented for relatively cheap, instead of having to spend 500-1000 before even knowing what to look (listen) for when buying a guitar.To me the questions until now were a bit too easy but that's Ok. I might be studying with people half my age so that's fine. Especially the first questions should not be frightening but at least tickle your brain ""a little bit"" instead of just repeating a word from the video.Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to study with you (all) !Sincerely, Xavier Weydert",3
"On one hand - basics. On the other, you may be lost in the last part of the course. You don't need to understand to complete assigements, but netherless - it's hard to understand if you do not have experience in embedded systems topic",3
"I found the Course very interesting, well prepared from the Tutors and I liked the case study Approach since it provides actual examples where Machine Learning can be realized. I am interested to enroll in the second Course of the certificate to validate if it will go into more Details and Background regarding the build of the algorithms theoretically and in Python. I would like to thank both Tutor",3
Need allot of improvement,3
The only reason I give 3 stars is because there were no pdf documents of the lectures. Being able to check back notes fast is important and very helpful and I can't see why they are not given.Other than that the course content was very interesting and fascinating. Well done on that!!,3
"Good to be able to apply the lessons from the individual courses in one, single project, but I missed having actual teachers to review my work as well",3
This course rushed through the material at the end.,3
"The assignments should be flexible, i.e we should be given the score based on what we have answered and provided an opportunity to re-take them if we have to improve the score further instead of having a strict policy of getting all the answers correct in order to complete an assignment.Further the lectures were as though the faculty is reading out from a board in front of them (with an exception of Frederik Krebs), and thus many concepts were only touched on the surface. For people with not much background in organic chemistry understanding PEDOT:PSS and other chemical components we tough.A suggestion would be to increase the class duration and explaining the concepts in a more clear way.",3
"Although a neat idea, I was a little disappointing to find that over the course of 4 weeks we'd only be creating and adding to a small paper game. I was hoping for something a little more in depth. And although I don't disagree that this course provided some wonderful input to creating a game, I felt that it was something that could have been done in a single lesson.",3
"Very short lectures and easy assignments, but a good overview and starting point for further studies.",3
"Lessons on html and css are very good, better than other coursera classes, so I suggest you to give a look at those. In general, the teacher is very good, even though I found the javascript part less deepen. A week, and partially the last week, are dedicated to the construction of a restaturant site. Unfortunately, the student role is pretty passive: you'll just look the teacher at work, you'll not build a site in this course. I skipped much of those lessons. But the most disappointing point is for me the excessive simplicity of the assignments. The assignments are the primary reason why I decided to take a MOOC instaed of simply reading a book. I expected much (interesting) assignments and much more practice...",3
"The speaker was very difficult to follow with dialogue flow, random pauses, and stumbling over words. The rate of the speaker's speech was also very fast. The material was very useful, and informative otherwise.",3
Only brief course.,3
"Good introduction to Pandas. Interesting information, but not that information dense compared to other courses. Musical intros and outros on videos waste too much time. Too many ""ums"" and ""ahs"". Later assignments can be hard to get exactly right due to bugs in QSTK and also uncertainty around event counts. Would have liked to be able to discuss work-in-progress code more, but understand that it's tough to manage cheating in an online course.",3
"good, but no material and lack of structure",3
"I couldn't finish it without purchasing it, in spite of active participation and high scores on all the assignments I had access to.",3
"It might have been a better option to conduct the class in the instructors' mother tongue with English subtitles, though concepts are well enough communicated. I am a Francophone and I still find it not easy to understand the English (having French translation in my mind.)A good introductory class to have a first glimpse at the general context of academic publishing. Good general overview to rethink the steps of publishing plans for early stage researchers.",3
"I wish there were another conflict specialization on Coursera to choose from.. one that is more modern, up to date, interesting, engaging, less patronizing .. etc. but there isn't. So I guess we're all stuck with this one. Need I say more.",3
"The actual educational value of this course is quite high. The score I can offer it in good faith is dragged down by the additional ""assignments"" like ""Write you own quiz question!"" and the expectation to review the quiz questions thought up by other students. Such things in a scientific course are unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive because of the reliance upon other students and their grasp of the material. If they are to remain part of this course, they really should be treated as supplementary and not required to complete the course. It really detracts from the experience for those of us who come here to learn and not to socialize.",3
"Good, simple, straightforward, and applied. It starts to introduce you to the language and platforms of data science, but it is most definitely not a standalone course if you want to be conversant in the field. Really just a ""taster"" to get you into the specialization.",3
"It was nice, considering the messages and the amount of time. However, participation and feedback by others was really limited.",3
"This course is quite challenging for beginners. I tried to do the assignment, the code of the assignment are those that i've never learnt before..i only learnt in the forum. Please review so that learners won't be too stress out..Thanks for your kind attention.",3
Would have been more interesting if the slides had attractive colours and videos had good animations.,3
Content was far too basic in my opinion.,3
The course provides the right platform to folks who are newbie to python and gives meaningful information for development on Raspberry Pi,3
Too easy.,3
"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about.",3
"Mediocre, not that helpful. Not the best. I was urged to skip all the vids in wk 2",3
"The course was a bit too shallow for me, the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries (json, socket, urllib, ElementTree) or external (BeautifulSoup).I really expected something more, for instance authentication techniques, or methods to parse complex websites, rather or in addition to the basics shown here.",3
The material is very interesting and relevant; however very quickly outdated in this area. There are a few mistakes here and there in the lectures and the quizzes.,3
a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library,3
"Very good course, only 1 BIG disadvantage: you cannot take the quizzes unless you buy the certificate...",3
Some useful frameworks but would have preferred to see more time spent addressing models and frameworks for testing the potential success of new ideas and comparing between different ideas. The tournament model covered here was not sufficient to really address this issue and it requires more depth. But otherwise a decent introduction to those not familiar/ experienced with business/ start ups.,3
"The teacher is not very enjoyable to listen to, however the content is very interesting.",3
"Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)",3
Not very proper explanation of How to use Control key with mouse to set button properties.No discussion forum,3
"The programming assignments are a great way to get your hands dirty with R, but this is not a course for someone without any prior programming experience, and I found the lectures didn't have much connection with the assignments.",3
"2 weeks were balanced and thought-provoking and one was silly, but entertaining... therefore three starts with 2 stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness.",3
"Super interesting, but it is a very basic introduction to nutrition. Only the first or second lessons have information about nutrients and how they are different from each other. The other sections you could've gotten from a Michael Pollan book, or one of his documentaries. Nevertheless, very engaging, visually and verbally, and ideal for someone who is getting started on nutrition.",3
very difficult course if you are new to R. Otherwise an okay course,3
"Relevant and well organized material when looking at it, but in total it is way too thin. More tips and tricks about Xcode as a tool would have been nice. Some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed. One of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lot.As for the final assignment. Being reviewed by only three persons is too few. One of my reviewers had problems with his Xcode environment and couldn't run my submission. Guess how he graded me. The other reviewers had no problems, luckily.There is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums, which seems pretty buggy. There are no TAs and the staff doesn't seem to be very active either.I'm sure the course will improve in the future. It's at the time of writing the only Swift/Xcode/iOS MOOC on Coursera.",3
"that's very good, but it could be better if there is a way to pay and get certificate. we are in educational and science word not politic word. I live in I.R.Iran and there is no way to pay.I suggest you to provide some prepaid card for Coursera, that we can use of them, same as ITune gift cards.",3
A good start for learning game design and development,3
"The content is good, but it's lacking articles, important bills etc..; and the quizzes aren't very hard",3
"It teaches an interesting topic, but it's a bit hard to follow the teacher. I learnt from the exercises, mostly.",3
A good introductory course. I recommend this course highly.,3
"Overall a good course for self-study. The assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning, analysis and interpretation. The quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures. The knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressed.The case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course. There is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting. THe format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency (along with extreme audio volume changes) also becomes distracting.Other than that, excellent for driving the need for reproducible research (RR) home, presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve RR and ways of publishing results/reports from these studies.",3
"Too easy if you already know anything about github or Rstudio, although I do understand the need for an introductory course. The ""Experimental Design"" video was the only really useful part and contained quite entertaining examples.",3
"Topic and approach are interesting, however the disturbingly-modulated voice and exaggerated accent of the professor can get a bit unbearable at times and make lectures arduous to follow and enjoy.",3
Genearlly it helps but I hope it would be much better if you have chances to review resume from each other and receive feedback. Thank you.,3
Very good audio and video quality. Explanations are very understandable and given with a lot of examples. Summaries and connections between the different content parts are provided regularly.,3
"The lectures are fine. However the content is way too easy. Another course on Coursera `Mining Massive DataSets` is much better, in the depth and horizon.",3
Sometimes I don't understand when the lecture gives some examples of an abstract concept,3
Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
"Good information, but the material is a little dry (the subsequent courses in the specialization are much more fun) - it's hard to make the introduction exciting, but adding some interactivity would be helpful.",3
"The theories are perfect, but a little simple for those who have already known them.",3
"Mostly preparatory material and setup activities for the rest of the series. It's OK, but not a revelation.",3
"Needs to be a bit more complex and detailed in order to help people get a good understanding of the complexities and issues involved in project management. Please use real world PM uses, not going to work..Show examples of project management that went horribly wrong..lots of those examples as well.",3
"Positive: It was refreshing to see this offering in Coursera. It is an important topic and there is limited amount of offerings (the Wharton course in accounting analytics crosses in the benfords law topic). The discussions in Madoff, Snowden, etc are positive to stimulate critical thinking. The approach was solid. The videos with real fraudsters were very good allowing to connect the theory to practice. The final exam with 60 questions is also very positive to force/stimulate the student to 'cement' the knowledge gained.Negative: This course was shockingly short. If discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds, per week there was only about 20-30 minutes of 'real' materials. This is not nearly enough a balanced output of resources to allow students to grasp the concepts. Institutions like Wharton, U. Michigan, U. Illinois, U. Virginia and Yale are packaging in their top courses/specializations at least 1.5 to 3 hours per module (what can have between 4 and 11 modules), plus resources - slides, readings, excel spreadsheets and others. This is an enormous gap. Also - although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites, more was expected. For example, it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to Bernie Madoff, Armstrong, Edward Snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion. The slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available. Also in some topics more detail was expected. For example, Benford's Law. It should been shown the formula used, what is the threshold value to raise suspicion that manipulation might be present in the financials and also what are considered to be normal values.Overall it is positive to see your offering but I think it can be improved and add a lot more valuable.I wish you luck.",3
I find the videos are overly formal and traditional in their rhetorical style. But the course' main contents and Practices are still relevant.,3
"Sometimes it seems very ""mechanic"". The instructor is clearly reading a script.",3
It seemed to me a little bit too superficial... It was almost only copying and pasting code...,3
"descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses.",3
"Labs are ok, Lectures lack interaction (just slides presentation) and the monotonous tone and long sentences of the presenter makes it hard to understand and difficult to pick out important points. (IMHO)",3
"there are so little video tutorials, and too many exercises without video instructions.",3
It's a good start.,3
"I have learnt a lot or new information and improved my understanding in the filed of motivation. I have leart that as a leader you need to communicate clearly the vision, set goals which are in line with the vision. The thing that I miss is how to connect the motivation with the set goals.",3
"Excellent lecturers and high-quality material to study, although the course is heavily centered on human History as opposed to Big History - i.e. early Universe and its development over a time span of billions of years.",3
"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results.",3
"The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly. This also was a problem during peer review of assignments.",3
"Eh, not great to be honest.",3
Too basic.,3
"The content is interesting but the videos are quite long. Also, in the audit version all quizzes are blocked.",3
Rather easy questions and not many difficult ones even in the optional exercises.,3
"It was little difficult to understand what the professor , but anyway it was good.",3
"Though familiar with the material, the lectures made several very nice key points about the Philosophy of Science which I found useful. However there are a few issues :-a lot of the lecturing is on a board which is hard to read-there is a lot more science than there is PhilosophyThe latter isn't necessarily a bad thing, but based on the title I expected more of the latter.",3
Very basic,3
"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",3
Average. Doesn't really like the Professor's style. He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy. Finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject. I would have prefer a more historical approach. Overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new Mooc from him. Thanks for the try though,3
"Good overview of machine learning. In general focuses more on how to do, but due to course length skipped on some of the how or why in certain topics. Good mentor responses. Lecture video pause points are bugged. Lecture and assignments are quite detailed to walk you through it. Course content not designed to be difficult. Weeks are not very balanced. Some weeks take longer than other weeks, and you don't really know until the week starts. One thing I really dislike is you can't take notes online while watching the video. You'll have to do it elsewhere (on paper, on notepad). There isn't a quick summary of topics covered in the video you can go to. This would help if you wanted to rewatch a certain part but couldn't recall which video it was in.",3
"I didn't like this course as much. Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and unforgiving and as an experienced, essay writer, I didn't feel I needed the rigid, boring academic structure required for this assignment. However, I made it through with a decent mark so I'm grateful for it.",3
It was a bit hard to follow the instructions.,3
"I was slightly disappointed by the course: too much information was given and not always in a clear way. In particular, sometimes the sessions were jumping from one discipline to another with not much explanation and this was confusing. Also, the information provided was in huge amounts but not in details. I expected to get more detailed information on children's rights while sometimes the presentations were only very general overviews.",3
Assignment Doings felt not that good as the courses before.,3
"It's globally a nice course, although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real, full course. I was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details, but just given as assumption or obvious concept: If you are familiar with that concept, you will be fine (but probably won't learn that much), while if you are not you will be probably lost. I mean, for a free course this is already a pretty nice job, and I think it is worth to take this course. I would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic.",3
Discussion forums for this course was not quite helpful.,3
"Well, I think I learnt some things about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. However, the course hasn't been focused on programming with JavaScript to solve real problems. All assignments are based on the creation of images from scratch, the modification of these images and hide messages in an original image. I really don't think these types of assignments can help students to learn Web technology. In fact, I know some professional Web programmers that they don't use javascript to manipulate images but in some cases when it is really necessary. I'd change the way of how the assignments are presented to prove the students' skills. For example, a possible assignment could be the implemention of a counter on a Web page using JavaScript or the creation of a web page with buttons, emerging messages, menus etc. On the web (Googling), there are a lot of codes that allow these funcionalities and could be used and modified by other students to create their own Web page.",3
"Good enough for a free course offering very basic understanding of the topic. Lots of video errors, and sometimes the lecturer's speech isn't very smooth. Tests are poorly worded sometimes in ways that contradict the language used in the lectures, making them difficult to pass even with notes. I wouldn't pay for the certificate - if I were an employer I would not recognize this course as teaching any sort of proficiency.",3
The data document for assignment is a mess.,3
"Very good information and resources provided. Unfortunately if you don't pay for the course you have no access to the assignments. This is the only course of several that I have taken where this is so. Surely, those non-paying students could still submit assignments, it is possible in other courses why not this one?",3
I am almost done with the course. The course Is a great intro touches on some of the important subjects but it lacks the depth required to cover the topic appropriately. would love to see a specialization in this topic with more hours and content covered.,3
"A good introduction in general.However, more practical exercises are required.",3
"not actually much useful course, but still provide some interesting information",3
"I found this course quite hard to take to; especially after starting the second one on Character. Saying that though, it is good to learn about different perspectives and approaches as education whatever form enables us to move forward on our learning path.",3
The information is well presented but painfully slow.,3
I think it would be more easy to understand the concepts with more examples,3
not too many new things about Python. mostly introduction to Python capabilities in databases/overall pretty good class.,3
"In the end it is a good course. The videos might seem short, but are filled with tons of information. It has guest professors who were very interesting, and I hope they could have give their perspective on the subjects as well.There is no reading material, which is kinda sad. And it's naturally a little partial in favor to jews, but that's only natural. Prof. Susser, though, seems a lot more objective.I thank very much the professors for this course.",3
need more engagement and exercises before every week task,3
Did not like that I have to upgrade just to take a quiz,3
"If you are already familiar with ML you won't learn anything new. The deep learning part is new, but it too short and lacks detail. I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered ""learning"". By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of ML and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own. However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization. It would be nice to be able to skip this course and still get the specialization completed. if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away. I will continue with the specialization with the hope in the next courses the topics are covered in higher detail.",3
Too theoretical for my needs but gives a good background to how to approach analytics.,3
"The final assignment could use a little bit of work, from a clarity standpoint. I actually think that the exercise is quite rewarding, but the expectations of, and directions for participants aren't entirely clear (and that's coming from a native English speaker).",3
Asigments are too easy to implement,3
This course is a better option to start with programming and that also with Python.,3
This course had a lot of valuable information but in the quizzes it was only the most basic questions asked. And I would have liked more practice quizzes. Over all a good course though!,3
Less required reading and more targeted lectures would make it great. It often seemed that the questions in the quiz weren't properly covered in the material provided.,3
"So the course is a mixed bag.PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding. However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures. The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments.",3
I am disappointed by not being able to do the assignments unless I pay for the course.,3
"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part.",3
"I have done the first 2 parts and I am half way through the 3rd and I am finding some of the information to be inaccurate. According to the NHS in the UK condom failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course. It also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on Abstinence. I would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information.",3
"Week on NSURLSession and CoreData is ok (but compared to other courses on Coursera - so and so). Everything else - not very good. But anyway, quick dive into swift.",3
Very simple course introduction.,3
Completed it in a day but haven't read the recommended texts yet - which I will do. Some extremely interesting and thought-provoking material. Would have liked more than 3 weeks,3
The assignments were not very challenging nor were the lectures very in depth.,3
the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.,3
"Not really a fan of Mick's way of teaching, he seems to have spent most of his time playing with the music or drawing app rather than explaining the features. I also think it would have been helpful to explain more about the purpose of Session.get for retrieving the features and plotting them into data. I think one of the issues with this is there aren't really many active folks on the discussion, so it is difficult to try to find a solution to problems you are having.",3
It is a very basic course to give you high level of what the course is going to cover and the tools that will be used throughout the course. If you have much programming background this course will be a breeze.,3
"Some interesting topics and detailed insight, but the course could be more systematic.",3
Good way to get started with doing from just listening or reading.,3
I felt overwhelmed by too much information all of a sudden in each lesson.,3
"Hi, I loved this course. However I'm a bit surprised that didn't got a certificate for doing it. That's why I don't put 5 stars.",3
good course but not fully completed. Learned a lot about herbalism.,3
"A good introduction to Python, but the course is a rather short & I think more could have been said about genomics-specific functions, modules, etc. and how to use them.",3
"I have some programming experience, but I often could not understand the questions being asked in the programming assignments. Not because of my skill level, but the lack of clarity in the directions. I felt that I learned a lot while taking this course because it held me accountable, but the course design could be much smoother.",3
"The main reason for my rating is because the course is so ""loose"" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks. Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought. When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period. Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date. I know that this is exactly what will happen in the ""real"" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of ""noise"" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.",3
i supposed that may be i am not very clever so the content and the question after the class also make me confused. a little bit disapoint with this course. but i saw a lot people below think this a good course so may be i am wrong.,3
"Very good course, but I did't like how the last week focused on test taking. The course should focus more on 'learning how to learn,' not how to ace a test. In that regard, I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults. Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively?",3
Would have loved a little more theory.,3
"My background is a degree in Cognitive Science, and I believe my review may be more specific to this perspective. If your background is psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience, then you may not learn a whole lot of new learning techniques in this course. However, it was an easy and light refresher and provides a lot of useful analogies to reshape (or ingrain deeper) learning techniques you are already aware of. I did learn a few additional learning tools that I plan to implement. If your background is not from one previously mentioned (or similar), this is a great, easy course that will help you learn in all areas of life and is worth taking, esp. for the small time commitment each week relative to the potential life-long benefits.",3
Building a Data Science Team does indeed contain helpful recommendations for starting data science teammanagers/executives; for me it had a little too much of a Hu,3
"Turi stopped working on SFrame (at least on Github), and SFrame does not supports Python 3. Expect some difficulty if you use other tools like pandas - the programming assignment completely assumes you use SFrame. Fortunately data of csv format is provided, so you can complete it anyway but again, don't expect a smooth ride.Also the lecture tends to cover general concepts than mathematical details. I don't like it, but that would be a good point to the starters.",3
"The many errors in the quizzes and the basic structure of the course - like having no link to a textbook in a central location - makes the experience of the course very very poor. The quality of the material makes up for it, to some extent - but there needs to be more Coursera support (I think) to get the errors in quizzes and stuff sorted out. The mods are doing an amazing job keeping people calm, but Coursera needs to do better.",3
Why were we talking about money managers and hedge funds? What does that have to do with data analytics for business? I never saw the connection and they never explained it.,3
Too much emphasis on irrelevant fact-repeating (eg date a convention was signed) rather than content and implications of the content for practice.,3
I was expecting more modules on configuration management like deployment manager service.,3
Adequate information to grasp on. Learn something useful. But the videos are a bit boring that sometimes I have a hard time to carry on. Hope to share more interesting video examples and reading materials. Good effort but spice up the video a bit with salient stuff instead of pure talking and notes would be good.,3
"I agree with some of the reviews here. It's fantastic at the beginning of the course. Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand. The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated. My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else. I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures. Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1? The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall. The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better. I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.",3
not for ones who can google,3
"As a software engineer I found this course a bit useless, but I do understand other people don't have the same background. Having said that, I believe it should be optional in the specialization.",3
"you have to let us know in the beginning of the course, that we have to pay for finish the course!!!",3
"Course content is ok, but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical details.Tasks are pretty easy, and this is from algorithmic perspective, because from programming there are almost nothing to do.And overall it feels that there are not so much info as for 5 weeks course. If it would cost lest, than it would be ok. But for 80$ I've expected more.",3
Some of the lessons aren't clear enough to follow,3
"The course content is good. But it needs some polishing...Major comment:The assignment submission/review process should be improved. Grading system is not clearly defined at the time of submission. Some grading question are inherently subjective ""Is the code at least somewhat efficient?"". But even for inherently objective questions ""Is the code correct?"" (as does it give the correct answer"" the staff does not provide the correct answer... I think the staff should create some automated review for what is objective: does the code compile? does it yield the correct answer? is it efficient enough? (Just like many other courses on Coursera) And only when it passes the automatic review, use peer grading for coding style. Finally there a lot of confusion with the deadlines.Minor comments:Lucky Coursera has an option to play twice faster! Not that the content is too easy, but the talking ... pace ... is ... hum... very ... ... slow. Also how come for a programming course the slides with code are so poorly formated???",3
Bit tough and the professor's were rushing through the course in videos.,3
"There were a lot of good nuggets in here, but overall this course felt somewhat disjointed compared to the others. It would be nice to have more practice with some of the different formats (e.g., JSON) and for exercises to loop back to some of the early content. I did like that the final exercise required a fair amount of investigation into understanding the documentation and relationship between the files before undertaking to code.",3
Good. Easy to understand with simple exercises. Lots of things are learnt. But better be more interesting with more ways of presenting and showing.,3
"I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my 6th course. All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great. But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews. I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course. They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case. Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...For the record, I almost aced this course. The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it. I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst. I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities). Then I couldn't get motivated. 1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off. Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks. The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible). The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course. For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more. Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours. Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon (My partner was not pleased).Now here is where things get awkward. I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars. It accomplished something that some University courses could not. I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems. So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?Would I take the course again? I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification. If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn. In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars. If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority. If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.",3
"It is quite general, I liked the examples, although there could be more varied examples from many other dissimilar disciplines.",3
In my opinion a clear guideline is missing. The terms are not always the same and it's sometimes confusing.,3
"I think this is a good review for someone who has the basic in English grammar; however, if you're an ESL student or English-speaking person (who need to start over in grammar).Study first before starting this course.A lot of the feedback in the forum, I found to be poor except when it came from an English-speaking person.You get a lot of: "" OK, Great, etc.."", no real feedback.",3
Good base to start building a site,3
"This course is good; but not the best. In some videos, the instructor was hard to understand and I had to turn on closed captions.",3
Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures,3
"There exist some sort of help for solving programming.However, those bad quiz as well as not so comprehensive courses design totally ruin it.",3
"Helpful tips, but this course should be free.",3
A bit complex topics for just an introductory course.Nevertheless interesting explanation on CAPM and ABT.,3
The sound doesn't turn up very loud.,3
Is a great course...,4
Prof. Oakley is awesome. It's quite difficult to understand Prof. Sejnowsky because he's just reading what he's saying.,4
"Another good course, though the last two weeks were a lot harder to follow than the prior ones. Not because the material was that much harder, but the lectures and homeworks were less clear (a lot of descriptions of how to do various operations without explaining why).",4
"It took a little while to get interested in the course, but by the end of first week it began to get interesting. I liked the professor and his friendly style. It is definitely an overview of the major events of history. One can always find out details about events that one wants to know more about. This course gives a broad idea about world history and in a way helps us see what the future would be like. Because history does repeat itself.",4
Very good lectures. Some of the tests could be improved. Monitors should also be more present and follow through the questions more closely.,4
a bit labored at times which makes most lesson longer than might otherwise be.Patient teacher who is keen on his subject and tries very hard to teach in great details,4
"Excellent intro to using Tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr) to manipulate and clean data in R. Occasionally the readings and the SWIRL homework don't quite match up, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means. It was definitely worth my time overall.",4
This is a great course to start using R,4
Nice course.Learned new things.Professor describe all things very well,4
The course was really helpfull for understanding machine learning concepts and application.,4
best and very valuable course,4
"I found many interesting insights into how dogs became man's best friend and into dog cognition. However, some of the points were belabored far too long; in addition, problems in dog behavior--such as biting etc.--were not really dealt with at all. For me, the promise of knowledge of dogs leading to knowledge of self remained unfulfilled. I could also have used more practical insights into how a dog can be guided (trained) to become the ideal companion.",4
"A very good course in general. The materials and assignments are practical and the explanation of the instructors are clear. You are expect to gain a general knowledge about computer vision, camera calibration, and the usage of linear algebra in computer vision.One thing that could be improved is that there is a big jump from week 2 to week 3 and also from week 3 to week 4. It's like a sophomore course at week 1 and week 2 and suddenly it jumps to a senior course in week 3 and a graduate course in week 4. It might be better to provide some supplementary materials in between.",4
"Great course first of all.One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures. The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift,which are really useful, but they are not comprehensive enough. So for most of the students, I believe, will have to do a lot of self-studying to finish the final project.But still, the final project is challenging and interesting. Swift is not a hard language to learn, so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming, I was able to finish the project.",4
"Very, very interesting course. Clear lessons and nice new concepts.",4
"Very good course. It overviews the main machine learning systems in both ways, theoretical and practical.Maybe it lacks of a final project, but is one of the limitations of these kind of online courses.",4
"Good course, but very introductory.",4
have some knowledge about python now,4
"The course material is great, but the assignment is too simple, especially the last(You don't need to write any codes). I think the assignments can be more challenging.",4
"Great course, assignments take more time than listed, and I found the discussion forum very helpful to learn more about the assignments and interact with other classmates. Overall I learned so much of commands from this course.",4
"Good first steps in project management,",4
"It was easy to understand, it has nice rityhm to follow",4
Very nice course!,4
A lot of g,4
"Although not in deep, this course provides the basics for learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS in a confortable way. Teacher David Rossiter is great explaining the basics and also the language is easy to understand even for those not very used to eanglish language.",4
I really enjoy interview with founders . This course give me lot of insights to founded by venture with customers and involve them as soon as possible. Thanks,4
Nice Course.Good Explanations.,4
Insightful,4
It is a course that will provide you a start on creating a Mobile App. The subject matter is very well presented and exercises are well thought of. It does give you the glimpse into programming and deployment of the app to your mobile. It does not make you an avid programmer of mobile app. It does brush upon the geo position tutorial. But overall very concise and well thought through topics.,4
"good game design introduction course, lots of concepts, great!",4
Simple to understand and helps student to learn programming from scratchwith simplest examples,4
"It is a great course so far, with a lot of applicable topics covered. However, I feel that some of the questions are structured poorly to achieve their goals.It is fine to have difficult questions where students are expected to do a lot of extra research, but it should done in a way that they students know what they are getting into ahead of time, and not include questions or code that does not run without explaining what is supposed to be done.It's just not a good teaching technique for learning.",4
"Apart from week 4, I found all classes very instructive and relevant. The video's from Erik Meijer in week 4 seemed a bit artificial. The exercise in week 3 was not really related to the classes other than that we learned in the course that there is a way to proove something and then we needed to. I could not really understand why or when I would apply that knowledge.",4
"An excellent course. The inclusion of excerpts allows one to develop a greater understanding of the different topics dealt in the MOOC. Also, several excerpts are from stories written by authors based in different continents; this makes reading the excerpts all the more interesting. Also, the course allows one to adjust the deadlines for submitting assignments, which is a good thing.",4
enjoyed doing the wireframes!,4
"Great course! The material is presented in a detailed way that makes it easy to understand even if you're new to economics, using a local sandwich business as a real life case study was really cool, plenty of practice questions to test your knowledge. An all around winner",4
It's a very good course.,4
This course is really helpful and useful with great contents and tips !,4
"Very good, simple, understandable course, for everyone who want to improve his English.",4
"Very interesting course, which has helped me be more cognizant of how I'm processing things. It also confirmed some beliefs I have about how my mind works (which is just like everyone else's!).",4
Very interresting course for Python lovers.,4
I learnt quite alot about design luminaries. Would prefer if it was truely global but still a very interesting course,4
pure functional approach to solve problems.,4
"Good course with a good Instructor. It's a real basic course and good for beginners, though you need to have to dive into Python and Spark on your own to follow the course and the assignments. :)",4
Straightforward and easygoing!,4
Awesome course,4
very informative. I le,4
Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.,4
"Overall, a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks. However, I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes. Some of the quiz items were ""off-syllabus"" too, although this encouraged further reading. I enjoyed the programming exercises, particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and would have liked more of them. For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng's course first.",4
The only thing that this course needs is more consistency/clarity using the constant with regards to state variables.,4
"I enrolled in this course based on the description, which mentioned that we will build a fully function web app at the end. That literally means, at the end of the course. I was expecting to build the web app from the beginning of instruction all the way to the last video. Instead, the code to the web app is on github. The instructor gives very clear explanations for interpolation, directives, expressions, etc and shows what the code looks like in a javascript file. He also does a great job demonstrating how to write and test dependency injections. This course is geared towards beginners who have never see or touched AngularJs and not for those who already have the basics.",4
very enlightening and informative course,4
"As with many subjects, it is what you think you know that prevents one from making progress; both from a perspective of the lack of a perceived need for continued work as well as new and counter-intuitive concepts that are the essence of new understandings.",4
Good for a general understanding of the mainstream theories relating to business strategy and corporate governance.,4
"In my opinion, this course is so simple but yet an effective learning tool for those individuals who are a beginners in the field of terrorism and counterterrorism studies. Even though, if it is not your field of study, this course gives you a beginners look on how things actually role in this field and gives you a sense of satisfaction along with deep and clear understanding of this body of knowledge than what the mainstream media shows. This course have given me and think it will for others, an incentive to do something about these issues mentioned in the course.",4
"Thanks to team that put together the course, I really liked itIt covers the topics in sufficient detail with relevant cases /examples, which makes its really easy to get the concept.Would be nice to also have (which is why I did not give it a 5 on 5) - A section on team structure (which in my view is the missing link for this course and which often is a challenge managers cope with and can have a big influence on motivation) and a few more corporate speakers / examples (beyond Menlo, people not from US don't really know much about this company)Overall a course I would surely recommend to all people in my team",4
"A basic course into ethics, principles etc of a journalist. Assignments are straight forward and interesting.",4
"entry level, very basic concepts for professionals. It would be very good for anyone who wants to know about fire protection engineering. No background is needed, but engineering background",4
Easy to follow for begginers.,4
Initially a little misunderstanding on the differentiation needed by the overseers of the course to relate to the diverse backgrounds of the participants. Formats and personal adaptations became more mutually understood and accepted. Course ended in strong accordance. The re-enactments and vignettes are excellent!! (and goofy--on purpose). This was the strongest component of the three so far.,4
Course was a fulfilling refresher course. Presentation was direct and easy to comprehend course material. Only downfall is the lack of a course forum for participates to communicate with others to get further instruction in areas of need.,4
Too focus on taking tests,4
This course is very useful for beginners without any knowledge of Chinese language and culture.,4
Good learning on data analysis & its method etc & how it can be used,4
Learn some of the powerful mental tools to help you grasp tough subjects,4
Great course with helpful information. Thank you!,4
"A very good course, I learned a lot about new perspectives and history of photography",4
Good to get an understanding of a Business Analyst / Business Data Analyst / Data Scientist job.Financial concepts brought seem a bit out of place in the context of this specific course though.,4
"I would have loved to get more information. Addtional readings, forums to share ideas and recipes, projects etcs about food, health and nutrition. Maybe homework would increase our knowledge! Some paper as final assignment would be helpful.Thanks for the course and enjoy your meals :)",4
Great faculty and course content,4
excellent! best place to begin with Big Data and ML!,4
Good Course! But focus should be more on OOPs Concepts through video lectures to better understand it.,4
"Could have used more graded homework problems. I understand the foundations, but could have used some more solidification",4
"A very practical and informative course, the links and readings are also very educational.",4
The course was short and to the point which helped me understanding the use of punctuations specially Comma and semi colon and different types of sentence structures and variety.,4
A great review of current advancements in physics presented in a manner comprehensible to people with basic physics knowledge. Only issue was with some slides which had text in colours which was difficult/impossible to read for my type of color blindness.,4
"It's a nice course ,especially made by Peking University and teachers are quite easy and charming ,Itbetter to have more pratical projects about C++.",4
"Good for beginner, but somehow too simple for further study.",4
Very good course! The only problem for me was the poor quality of the sound.,4
"An in depth explanation of how to use Excel for Linear Regression and what the Output values in Excel's Regression mean. Note that the transcripts/subtitles contain many errors, which can be problematical for the hard of hearing or non English speakers, which is why I gave the course only 4 points.",4
"This course being an introductory to Specialization, doesn't stand so good alone. What I really liked were the real-world examples of companies. As introductory course it was fine, but id didn't contain practical assignments (as following in Specialization courses do). The structure of the course was ok.",4
This is a very interesting and rewarding set of lectures from a very knowledgeable and kind guy. Love it,4
"Very useful, full of important concepts which you can use in any field",4
"Good pacing, good explanations, reasonable expectations.",4
Thank you for this course. It helps me learn a lot of interesting about Data Science.,4
"Parts of it seemed a bit salesy, but I really enjoyed the insights from Tressie Lieberman.",4
Very good course for the beginners.,4
"A bit easy, but a good primer. Looking forward to the rest of them.",4
"Great mix of low level technical details, exposure to a variety of topics, and high level strategies.",4
very helpful but i finished it and there are no results to see!,4
"A very good course, i liked very much the examples used, i do wish there where some practical exercises.",4
"Entry-level of Quantitative models development skills, good for a new comer like me.",4
ProGreat introductory creative writing course.ConNeed to create a more structured approach for people when they are giving feedback.,4
great start for any one who would like to build his own game,4
"Good introduction to many core concepts. Overall video and presentation quality are quite good. The course is not particularly challenging, so if you are concerned with time requirements, I don't think you need to worry.",4
very good course,4
"Excellent introduction to Scala and the principles of functional programming, with lots of challenging and enjoyable exercises. My only minor complaint is the some of the exercises require knowledge that has not yet been covered in the course. However, it could be argued that this encourages active research by the students, which isn't necessarily a bad thing!",4
Was quite a good experience but in my opinion this course is for individuals working in the field.,4
"Good content but the Chinese translation is bad, which makes quiz quite obscure in meaning",4
Very informative class. Some of the hard topics in the last 2 chapters are not explained in a way that matched with the code terminology but good examples were given to help figure it out further.,4
awesome brainstorming,4
"Great Course, the way that Barbara uses to explain is very understandable. Nice content, easy going course and effective.",4
"Useful,but not very deep.Succeeding in giving a general understanding of Python",4
Teachers are excellent!,4
"Really liked it, Professor Rossiter was very thorough at explaining the content. Would recommend if I was starting to learn Web design/development.",4
"Really nice course, but the quizzes kind of take much from the examples presented in the lectures, so it seems to me like learning by heart would be somehow enough to get the grades. Comprehension could be more emphasized in the tests. Said another way, I found the quizzes to be rather easy (some questions were tricky, but many seemed to me rather obvious).",4
a little bit hard,4
"Very good course. The last week's lesson on Tuples seemed pretty straightforward, but the last assignment seemed to require ""stretching"" a bit beyond the material outlined in the videos. I eventually got the answer, but felt a little bewildered and surprised at first as all previous weeks had lecture material and reading that made it rather easy to complete the assignments! I suspect subsequent courses in this specialization will be harder! Overall, this was a great course though",4
"Superb instruction, great that there are optional levels of problem-solving (i.e., for those wanting only a review of the topic, you can do just the worksheet problems and skip practice problems). Still, the ""none of the above"" options on quizzes with numerical answers is something I would reconsider.",4
"Good. However, I need more detail and advanced exercise.",4
Course was very informative and helpful. I learnt a lot about unity and its tools and concepts. But there was very less scripting (coding) in the course.,4
really good course,4
"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating :-)One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. So look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quizzes.",4
A good starter on the topic of project management!,4
"Good course, but needs in depth discussion on few topics.",4
A good course but way too easy since I'd programmed in other languages before... I finished the whole course in an afternoon but was useful to learn some of the important syntax and key words in the python language,4
Very Nice course for Corporate Finance,4
Great course to learn all about tracking progress in your software project,4
Good start for the beginners especially for people new to the data science. Topic are not covered in depth but as its just a introductory course so its totally fine..,4
Good one :),4
Highly Knowledgeable & learning.,4
"Enjoyed learning about the different statuates and policies as well as how to read them. From those not from US and fear that the stuff learnt may not be as relevant, don't fret! What's introduced are major policies that are important to the global community!",4
Thank you for this course! Looks like basic training for entrepreneurs.,4
Very interesting topic but enough practical exercises,4
Awesome course,4
Course information is delivered in a new and exciting format. The first half of the course builds up base Chemistry ideals and Laws. The second half takes the student to places they never thought they would end up. Be sure to brush up on your College Algebra before taking. Overall a fun and challenging experience!,4
"Great content, but it was too easy. I beleive students should have harder tasks to learn.",4
it is really good course. but the lecturer should speak slower and more focus on the important issues.Thanks overall is a good course.,4
"Thorough introductions on Fundamental concepts is provided that builds upon further advanced applications with practical examples. All in all, a very useful start to the course !",4
Good basic course.,4
Informative and thought provoking.,4
Nice introductory course.,4
Helps me to start off learning another new programming language. Provides me an alternative perspective when approaching problems at work.,4
a very good introduction to clinical trail,4
"Learned the fundamentals of marketing with a digital slant. The most interesting portions of the class were interviews with experts in the field. Appreciated that the professor replied to comments I made throughout the course. The peer-reviewed grading for assignments was problematic because the explanation of the grade didn't align with the percent grade. Overall, I'd recommend this course for a great foundation to marketing.",4
Good course,4
Very Good.,4
I ran into a few unexplained issues with final project but a very good course overall.,4
"I enjoyed this course and appreciated the fact that not all the assignments were multiple choice. It was great to be able to develop ideas through the case studies and exercises. I would have liked if actual TA's would review our work instead of other classmates, but I realize this might be unrealistic due to the high number of people enrolled in the course.",4
Fantastic Course. I'm so happy i took this class,4
"I started 2 Hours ago.... it's amazing, such good teachers !",4
A very interseting way to do a lot of things without a very few code!,4
"For those absolutely new to programming, this course covers the core foundations of programming and is taught in a very approachable fashion. I was pleased to see there was an introduction into what is occurring ""under the covers"" - solid intro to CPU, Memory, peripherals and how programs/software utilize these resources.",4
Basic approach to Python programming.,4
"The concept is very important, so it's good that this course is available. The video's are sometimes not that great of quality. It's okay to show recordings of lectures, but the sound is of less quality.Another thing is that the teacher says a lot of ""euhm"". I know he cannot help that, but once you notice this it becomes a bit annoying.",4
"Very good course for beginners, after completing you have solid basic knowledge of financial world. I expected some more mathematics though.",4
"This continues Dr. Chuck's easing into Python. It's a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource. The existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isn't really stressed, which is unfortunate as it's helpful. About the only thing I'd appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity.",4
quite a beginning to a journey.,4
"The course is really good, however, would suggest some additional detail be captured both in training and in the exams to add more coverage",4
"It is a good course, but probably just a little too short. I think it will be a good idea to develop some arguments more in deep.",4
"A new course with new material. The course is in the beginning stages of evolution, just like the human psyche. Perhaps someone will refine it in time but it is a very good course, especially considering nothing quite like this has been presented before.",4
The only downside of this course is absence of certificate. Everything else is extremely great.,4
A very nice introduction to the R programming environment. I learned a lot and it was fun to do!,4
"Good content, good opportunity to practice. But the teacher is very fast sometime",4
I'm ALREADY optimistic about my confidence and capabilities. I write down crazy ideas all of the time. This will not give me a framework for which I can have tons of fun and maybe get a show out there!,4
"Very very good! Professor Siedel, thank you very much.I missed more math, but I think It would be a different course then.Recommended.",4
"It is a very good course. However, I must admit that is discouranging making the course because when you do the course free you do not have the opportunity to make all the excercises. Despite that, it is very good.",4
Very informative course. Thanks Coursera and Yonsei university for this course.,4
High level but useful basics.,4
Great Lesson and great mentor. Hope there's more case study on the next batch,4
Quite a good resource,4
"I could learn this course in the ""step by step"" way, by refined assignments.",4
Too short,4
"I felt this course was stimulating, thought provoking and challenging. The course for me was about awareness more than just passing the quizzes. I felt the interviews were especially interesting. It is my hope that as I move towards opening my own business I keep many of these principles in mind.",4
Very good about smart phone,4
"So far the course appears to be very good, but the request for an upgrade after every video becomes more and more annoying as the number multiplies",4
Course is great and very useful for thorough understanding of Thermodynamics. But Exergy and Second law efficiency was not discussed. It should also be included,4
Great introduction to Unity3D. Everything is taught in a very comprehensive level. I would have liked to see more fundamentals of C# scripting though.,4
"Good overview of engineering statics. However, I wish the homework and/or practice problems were built into the coursera platform like the quizzes.",4
"It was usefull to recal my knowledge of electronics. The course is not deep, but it's that you want from ""introducting"" course.",4
I've enjoyed a lot this challenging course. To get a 10 in all the assignments is very hard. But 7 is achievable.,4
"This course is good, it was a bit repetive in the beginning and the most interesting content was late in the course, I would reccomend you to buy this specialization, I think next part will be even better",4
"The content is good for the most part. There are some errors in the instructions to the assignment which make the assignment more like a real-world spec than the authors probably intended, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!",4
This is a tough course.but teaching is very good.,4
Great!,4
a well organized and paced course.,4
"I found the presentations to be very clear and focused. In addition, the readings were a good introduction to the foundation and current thinking in the field.I was disappointed in the difficulty in connecting with other students. That would have enhanced the learning experience for me. I am new to Coursera, and understand thismay be a difficult aspect of the programs to control, but it's worth a try.",4
The course gives a perfect introduction to the field of Cybersecurity,4
Good test of what we learned in the courses.,4
As most other parts of this specialization this course was excellent.,4
"Informative course on Pricing. Great professor and interesting content.Content delivery was good. Additional references, case studies, journals, articles, and books to read on the topics, were very useful.Quiz tests were not hard, but they gave fair understanding of topic.Although some basic concepts weren't covered, the overall learning from the course are worth taking.",4
"I really found the course quite insightful, and was surprised with the amount of factors and variables that are taken into account when developing revenue strategy. I would have liked to see some mathematical aspect to this course.",4
"Briefly introduce some concepts of the drug use and some in neuroscience, a good introduction course.",4
"It was a great privilege for me to be here, i really benefited from it, it increased my potentials on construction management... Thank you so much..",4
Excellent high level introductory course at a very affordable price! The material is very accessible and pragmatic for a basic programmer but still alludes to the very complex theory behind the algorithms. I highly suggest reading the pdf course notes if you want more of the theory.,4
"This is not for beginners with no experience. The estimated weekly hours are absurdly low.No one has seen any sign whatsoever of the industry partner, SwiftKey, despite claims they will be around to help. The field has advanced dramatically since the course was developed. Be prepared to do a lot of research and trial and error.The specialization has been an excellent way to learn a fair amount on the topic, but it is just the beginning. The capstone will challenge you. It is rewarding when you complete it.",4
"it gives you a good summary of what you need to know however, its just a guideline you have to investigate deeper into the concepts on your own",4
good course but course material was too easy ... it should be more rigorous,4
It was very good and basic course. It would be great if its next part can also describe these technologies in detail and with hands-on experience.,4
"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It gives you an excellent regiment and list of characteristics that would make your pilot and potential series desirable. My only real issue, which makes it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the student feedback is somewhat limited in that not all students really understand how to give notes. Often times they are very vague (""good effort, write with move consision"") not offering enough particulars to know what you should be looking to improve. But that's the inherent limitation of a course offered in this format. Not a reflection on the curriculum itself.",4
"Prof. Jana S. Borg is the simply the best! Every lecture material (videos/exercises/final project) is carefully crafted to optimize student's learning experience. She's made the learning fun and that's not easy to do!Now, let's talk about the reason why I didn't give this course a full 5-star rating.... It's the students! As you might already know, this class requires us to put together a 5-minute screencast video that will demonstrate our understanding in 1) Tableau, 2) Business Analytics and 3) Presentation skills. Unfortunately, most of the students only care about the first one while blatantly ignoring the other two. And that makes the grading process a pain in the..errr.... you know what!Another important reminder. Be sure to submit the final project days before the deadline. Otherwise, you might be at risk of not getting graded by 3 other students! On the forum, a student claimed that she was forced to join this session because she couldn't get 3 peers to grade her project TWO SESSIONS ago! The horror!",4
detailed but slower...,4
nice course for python newbies,4
I did enjoining this program. Many thanks.,4
Very interesting and intuitive. Thanks.,4
"Good course, but topics covered are mixed with Java GUI library, Algorithm, OO of Java language. It would be good if this course can focus on OO feature of Java only.",4
"Thanks for providing us this opportunity. It was a very nice course. There are few things which might help improve the course:- For a four-weeks course, I feel the material was not enough. I feel there is room to add more items like the use of hyphens, colons, and determiners.Thanks again.",4
"Very up to date and challenging.Only drawback, not a lot of application and octave/matlab is good for a fast mathematical implementation but not for real application with python packages for example.Thanks Prof. Hinton for taking the time to make these insights publicly available!",4
"The cpurse is for someone who eants pure programing, in my case i want python for predictive procedures.",4
"Great, very easy for beginner. My only problem was with last exercise because I didn't understand very clearly how to get the program to find out min and max numbers. Video and book don't explain that part very clearly. But everything else is just fantastic.Thank you.",4
I am glad that I got an opportunity to learn a lot this course.,4
"i really like the material, i feel that i learning the basic of video game development",4
"Professor just does not explain the concepts well, just reads the code snippets. You need to figure things out the hard way. You don't get too much help from the moderators as well.",4
"This is an excellent course to get some basic knowledge about the iOS and Android history, when and how this systems developed their unique features, or how that influenced products in whole. Yet, quizzes are a bit boring. They require you to actually know history of evolving features tied to exact dates/versions.",4
"could clarify some more on the question it asks, for example, the question about intelligence.",4
I quite enjoyed this course. It gave a good background on the necessary basics for financial analysis.,4
"Nice instruction and instructor but if i do not have any idea about health education, it would have been difficult to me. we need also some more details (larger course).",4
"I don't know what I expected. This course was quite pedestrian, but it *is* an introductory course.",4
"good course, complete in terms of basic knowlegde in evolution, so very good for someone not very familiar with all the details on this subject. However, I was expecting more information on the teaching part, and especially I think most of the lectures on it should have been like the one in week 4.",4
"It's interesting,,,",4
"I respect the fact the lectures contain a lot of references to the outside world, e.g. goes beyond the academia.",4
"This was a great course which is taught by a passionate and patient lecturer. The whole 8 weeks covers the first half of Einstein's famous paper in detail. The pace can be slow, but of course you can always speed up the videos. The mathematics is very approachable - school level algebra is all you need. The only other prerequisite is a basic understanding of light and electromagnetic waves.",4
"Good to get a formal overview of all the phases and ingredients of data science projects, without getting lost in the details.",4
Really useful course for starters in python that want to understand how to connect their application to the web.,4
"Pretty good course, although could have been a bit more exhaustive",4
"While I was primarily taking this course as a prerequisite for the next course in the specialization (which covers MongoDB in a bit more depth), I found this to be a well-organized introduction to a compelling framework. The instructor did a good job of presenting the content in a way that should be accessible for new developers, while still being relevant to experienced developers looking to round out their skills by learning a new framework.Acknowledging that this is a review of the course and not the framework, it's worth noting that Meteor itself is promising in its ability to quickly deploy sophisticated client-server web applications. My firm has well-established boilerplate templates based on Node.js and Gulp.js and a few dozen dependency packages that satisfy many of the same capabilities, but which were developed over a period of months and come with a much steeper learning curve. The scope of modern capabilities that Meteor offers out-of-the-box for ""free"" is quite impressive, and allows developers to dive into the interesting parts without the overhead of configuring services and establishing a build process.My only criticism is the cost, if you're looking to attain a verified certificate. At least from the perspective of a professional developer, the course was a bit light on content by comparison to other Coursera classes with the same pricing structure. I was able to complete the initial coursework in less than a week, while still attending my day job (although it did take additional time to complete the course project). Ultimately, this would be more compelling at a $49 price point, at least relative to other Coursera offerings.",4
it's a great course that will help you save time and effort and study smart,4
"Good course for an introduction, the next course in the data scientist specialisation gets better.",4
Easy to understand for the beginner.,4
It's great to learn from the Head of Google Analytics.,4
There is lack of communication with peers and mentors. Its like styding alone,4
Very informational with hands on experience. Highly recommend it to others who are looking for basic courses in clinical data management.,4
"I enjoyed the course. very informative, i had taken business classes at school about 7 years ago. the information i had in this course were refreshing and some were also knew giving the time that has elapsed since my graduation",4
"Fantastic course! Audio needs some re-mastering, was frustrating at times.",4
Good course! The flow of the modules fit perfectly.But I wished they uploaded the lecture slides and the templates for the design thinking process.,4
"It was a good course. Although i wasn't new to programming, but I found the tutor very knowledgeable to let us think the code logic on our own meanwhile making us learn. The content is good too.Thank you !",4
"It is a great course, really interesting, really easy to complete though some of the topics are a bit challenging. Overall a great achievement to finish this course. (Although I didn't receive a certificate but at least I finished the course)",4
Very interesting and developed very smartly. Thank you.,4
A welcome change....Brilliant concept in the world of technology and data crunching this course makes it so easier to detach to materialistic things and follow your heart and do what you really like....,4
"Everything is explained very clearly throughout the course, and the structure they use to teach the subject , from basics to advanced material, is especially helpful. Would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in probabilistic modelling.",4
Overall the course is good. The last two weeks on AVL andSplay trees need more examples and felt a bit rushed.,4
A very interesting course! Recommend to all of you!,4
I would have liked the course to have more step by step lectures that would allow us to follow the same structure when going through our assignments. Maybe even explain the assignment in the start then apply each lecture to show how each step is done within the assignment. I had to resort to third party sites and found that alot of the assignments have been uploaded online already.,4
homework requires lost of effort and generally is not covered in lectures,4
Good Course but slightly schizophrenic due to the object oriented topics. Don't feel that they belong in this course and would be really ticked off if paid for it.,4
"Great course to learn about financial markets, although it is not challenging. The quizzes will only test how well you remember dates and certain definitions mentioned in the video. If you just want to learn about basics of financial markets then this course is perfect for you. Don't expect any calculations though.",4
"It seems staff do not monitor, or address, issues posted repeatedly to the forum, especially in regards to the final test (part 2 of the specialty). The content of the course is great, and if someone with the authority to make changes when errors are detected and reported did care for the course I would have have rated the course higher.",4
Good introduction to the topic for beginners,4
The final project gives a deeper insight and understanding of how to apply the strategist's toolkits in creating valuable competitive position for an organization. Great Professors,4
It's a wonderful course to teach you how to learn effectively.,4
"Several comments, in general the course is well conducted,it is not easy to follow, but this is natural as it a very abstract subject. The exercise sets (peer-reviewed) where very instructive, but I think that the quizzes where a little too easy in comparison. I missed a little a more intuitive view, a broader view of the subject as well as a review of more advanced applications and developments, such as infinite Galois groups, etc.",4
"The content in this course was invaluable and I learned a lot from the instructor videos, guest lectures and assignments. It's already changed the way I am doing business.My one complaint is with the grading system - and this is on Coursera and not on the course. I can't understand first why a peer graded assignment is considered late when I submitted it on time, and it's not my fault that others hadn't reviewed it yet. Similarly on a quiz, there were points given for answers that were supposed to be skipped if you had done the assignment. Therefore, the highest grade you could get on that quiz was a 57%. While passing was a 1%, it's still averaged into my final grade as a 57%. That doesn't make any sense at all.",4
"Still a very good course.Week 4 was very tough. The general concept can be understood from a 10,000 feet altitude but the lesson and programming assignment need to be reviewed, maybe with a slower step by step example.As some other student mentioned, it was... ""brutal"".Other than that looking forward to the next course in the specialization!",4
I just think that there could be more assistance with respect to the practice exercises :) otherwise the lectures by Jana were absolutely terrific :),4
It's a very good way to improve one's speaking skills. I really recommend it.,4
"Okay class. Could deal more with terminology, how to break down a case to read it and obtain information. How to's of it all. From getting the case on my desk, breaking into segments, how to make a claim and finding laws to support it. What is a theory versus what is a developed idea.Thanks!",4
Excellent course for python beginners! Thank You so much!,4
"Good introductory course and easy to understand, can be completed within 2 days.",4
"Like any course, you get as much out as you put in. The real learning comes from reviewing the reading material-- even as an IT professional, I was able to learn quite a bit. IMO, this material should be readily available as a high school elective.",4
Good start course. It seems some information not covered so sometimes it is difficult to understand the content.,4
"In general a well made course. However, I do not yet see the advantage of using BlueJ over e.g. Eclipse, as most people won't work with BlueJ after the course",4
Good course content with great examples,4
"The content of the course was really interesting and made me think about things I didn't think of before. However, I found the layout of this course really confusing. It would be better if there was no division per week, but just a list of mandatory things and a list of optional things.",4
"More exercises would be nice! Overall, a very nice course.",4
Exellent course. I rearned a lot about infographics and now I'm doing my own infographics. Thanks,4
"Excellent course that is precise, specific and unbiased.",4
"Excellent course, you get amazing information and valuable guidelines for free!",4
Good content - some prior knowledge of pandas is important.,4
"Very well presented, the subtitles are good, some of the quiz questions have excessive spacing between questions and answers (a minor area for improvement in presentation).",4
"The content covered in this course is great. However, I hope there was a more efficient way to communicate with student. I hope there is a way to bring student together like a group chat function in the coursera app. So, people who want to be more committed can communicate more often and effcient.",4
Gotta watch how the test questions are formulate as it can be overly deceiving......,4
Very useful,4
"I wish there was more R programming focus. I feel like there was a lot of theory, and then a blanket ""t.test will cover this"" treatment of implementation in R.",4
"Good course that provide basics. However, I wish it gave a chance to practice the gained knowledge!",4
"Heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Ng and the entire coursera team on pulling off such a great introductory course. Honestly, machine learning is such a vast topic, that every nook and cranny of the internet has some opinion or the other on its methods. It can get pretty daunting for a beginner. This course is a perfect balance of theory and practice. It doesn't get too ""mathy"", nor does it get too dumbed down on it. The basic ideas, their implementations are discussed thoroughly, and Dr. Ng himself is such a smooth lecturer. A section on what to do after finishing this course would be helpful, as there are so many domains of machine learning, that it can get pretty confusing to decide. Also, I found the assignment tutorials a bit vague. Multiple times, I happened to scratch my head trying to figure what exactly the assignment in asking me to do. Clearer explanations of what to do in the assignments would be great. All in all, a wonderful course. Thanks a ton!",4
Good Course with excellent teachers and good advices.,4
"This course gives a good introduction to some basic algorithms.The standards it sets for students, however, is very low. They ask you to download an already written piece of Python code and change a line or two.To get the most out of this course, I recommend implementing all the algorithms yourself, perhaps even in a different language.""Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences"" by Dan Gusfield will be very useful for that.",4
I love this course very useful.Thanks guys for all the lectures.,4
A good introductory course !!! Should be followed up with lots of readings ...,4
All topics are introduced well. The pace of the lectures could be faster.The programming assignments are a really good addition and help to understand how the techniques work!,4
"Good introduction course, but I hoped that there would be more assignments. Completed course in 3 days",4
"Very informative and good explained course. I have learnt valuable things, thanks to Mrs. Loh! The only thing i would complain about are the uncertain and a bit vague instructions for the assignment. It should be stated clearer f.ex. which theories are meant and a more explicit way of instructing the editorial calendar, f.ins. a template or something like that. Nonetheless a very valuable and good made and lucid experience!",4
That was great!,4
This is a good course with good support. But it still has a few teething problems.,4
"well organized, user friendly, brief but informative, based on videos (nevertheless, a transcription is always provided), if you are fond of metaphors you will definitely enjoy it. you have a choice to prepare a video clip (if you prefer the spoken language) or an essay (if you prefer the written language) for each assignment",4
"To depended on peer graded tasks, when all course is done an you are still waiting for others to rate you. This is really annoying part.",4
"The course is very difficult, but the quality is excellent. Due to the stringent grading of the program submissions, I believe more help should offered for each assignment.",4
simple and effective!fun and educational highly instructive,4
"Not very difficult, but essential.",4
This was very informative and right on the mark with how society feels and what is available in the lines of treatment/help.Thank you.,4
It's better to use Python 3 version.,4
good information shared,4
I think this was a 5 star course in 2015/2016. The course should have been updated to get 5 stars in 2017.,4
"Great Course, I think would be better if has more examples",4
"Its been a productive journey since my concepts about OOPS are crystal clear. I would surely enroll in more courses provided by UC,San Diego.",4
"As always great level of teaching by Dr. Chuck, but milestone tasks was not so challenging as within previous course. Thanks!",4
The peer review was too time consuming. Otherwise great course,4
"what a golden opportunity given by' almighty' coursera to train teachers to rather become professional teachers !!!.....wow coursera, you are perfectly the best .",4
"I have taken the course earlier, so am somewhat familiar with the layout and the materials. Overall it is a very good course and covers a wide range of subject matters. Roger has done a very good job explaining the concepts. I certainly would recommend this course to all who's interested in the subject.I realize that there's limitation on the time people suppose to spend each week, however, I would like to suggest adding homework, in addition to quizzes.Several video clips have some audio issues, not sure if that's fixable.",4
"Great class with a great teacher, but lack of a forum to discuss ideas and problems severely limits it.",4
This class is very demanding but fun to learn!,4
"It's pretty fun and indeed teaches the basics of game creation, however I found a bit simple.",4
"A bit too easy for a person who has used python a bit before. Otherwise, fun and interesting.",4
Very good. Thank you.,4
"This was a pretty good course. Assignment 1, especially, was very useful (conducting a need-finding interview). The storyboarding assignment was good, too. The assignments weren't always very clearly written, and I could tell from my peer-grading experience that some of the students had trouble understanding what was asked, especially the non-native English speakers.",4
"good course, but focus more on inferential analysis than predictive analysis",4
I personally find this course usefull. It teaches good current toolsDr Chuck is a very motivating guy.In order to get better the course needs more exercises,4
The course is a very straight forward overview of problem solving and decision making principles. A good introduction to using various supporting decision tools. Short and effective module.,4
"I liked the course, particularly the interactive part with peers. On the negative side, I find that the price of ~80 USD for the enrollment getting a certificate is a little bit too high for the 3 weeks online course. I think 30 or 40 for each course in the specialization would be a more reasonable price point.",4
"Professor Sachs is preaching to the choir with this course, and such a ponderous emphasis on the seriousness of the dangers of ""business as usual"" is unnecessary. The lectures are much longer than they need to be. Otherwise, this course is very valuable.",4
I would love to take the quizzes without an upgrade to see how I have done in my classes.,4
"Very good for beginners. But please improve colors of flowchart, i can't see the text inside the flowcharts.",4
"I learned a lot about doing it the better way, than I did. What would have been cool: The essential graphics from the videos and some school material to print out and work with it.THX!",4
"This course felt a little light compared to the other ones in the series, I wish I could have learned more. Beautiful Soup was introduced as a way to do things, but not thoroughly explained as a package. I did appreciate the in-depth explanation of XML and JSON formats. Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor.",4
The content was interesting but the lectures could have been taped in a more engaging manner.,4
"Veri interesting, I learned spme useful tips",4
So nice... I've learnt a lot.,4
"Good one, more examples about real life situations would be valuable",4
Great course for everyone.,4
The problem sets are like real life problems and the lecture focuses on what are the most confusing parts. It is a valuable course for someone who has just a little computer programming background to start one's journey with C language.,4
The lecture notes should be better organized.,4
Important concept about time management but I believe it would be more better if it is more detailed,4
Very good course!Assignments deserve to be longer and more challenging though,4
It is very useful who are interested in Genomics and overall computational biology.,4
"It is a very basic course, very useful for general public. But if your specialization is nutrition or public health, this course is way too easy and does not have enough info.",4
Good knowledge sharing for a beginner.,4
Outstanding course!,4
"A good introduction to the History of Spaceflight, was great to learn more about how the mankind could to start exploring the space.",4
Very useful.,4
Good course,4
It is a very helpful training course for leaders and employees working in different geos.,4
"The course has the best introduction to raspberry pi , very useful .",4
"This course is a good review of what I have learnt before, and it clears out some confusions. Quite useful.",4
"Good, however the instructor videos could be better in content.",4
"Excellent course for beginner in the world of big data. Some issues with the hands-on lab (maybe due to a change in Cloudera softs). Provided examples were not working as-is for me, because of some path issues. But great anyway.",4
I liked the fact that the final tests need your code.... so if you do not understand what you have done you will fail :-),4
Great introduction to logic.One thing I'd have appreciated to see is a set of accompanying recorded video lectures. My experience is that I find it easier in term of efforts and faster in term of time to absorb taught concepts when I engage both my hearing and sight senses while watching a lecture than reading only.,4
Well organized and good lessons/presentations!I suggest to insert more exercises/assignment to increase the student's skills!,4
"Good, but wish it went more in depth in lectures.",4
Good for new Korean learners to start from zero.,4
a basic course of inference but i think perfecto for this mooc,4
It was an insightful course which looked at key strategies most often ignored by social marketers. Randy did a great job on that excel sheet for the capstone project! Thank you.,4
Really Enjoyable!,4
This is a very good place to start if you want a career in data science. I really learnt a lot and currently using it my data analysis projects. I would recommend this course to any one who likes to work with data.,4
"Actually, it was not that much hard but I got to know various new things.",4
I enjoyed this class!,4
Really straight forward content and great overview of SQL + SQLite. Nice python demos. Sometimes the instructor wanders a bit before he gets to his point.,4
"very nice soft start into programming, for someone who has some background would not be challenging but encourage them to continue through this specialization where it will be more challenging through the specialization",4
"I really enjoyed the class, and I feel like I learned a lot! I'd have given it 5 stars, but there's there are parts of the homework asignments that aren't well organized, for example I didn't know about the unit tests in the discussion threads for a while, and there's more detailed descriptions of the programming sections but they're really hard to find. All in all, a really good experience though.",4
"Good,but I think somewhere is not clear.",4
"Great overview of the subject, appropriate homework assignments to understand de value of the concepts we ar talking about",4
very interesting,4
"very well, structure, the quiz was admirably hard, but satisfying to work through and solve. you made me think outside the box, excellent",4
"I really enjoyed this course and felt the material was appropriate in scope and quality for an introduction to Aerial Robotics. I have a few issues with it though.While this wasn't a problem for me, I feel those who haven't done maths with vectors and matrices before would struggle with the maths presented here.There was some inconsistency in notation throughout the lectures - though I expect this will be fixed in future runs of this course.Given how much the programming assignments involved tuning PD controllers, I think there should have been some additional material provided on how to go about doing this.The difficulty of the last programming assignment came out of nowhere and given that you need to pass all the assignments in order to pass the course, this made it especially stressful. Having gotten almost full marks on the course until that point, the prospect of that all being for naught because I couldn't complete the final assignment in time was incredibly stressful and unfair. The simulation would fail with a Matlab ode45 error - with absolutely no information as to why that should fail. Trying to debug something by guesswork on a time limit is not a valuable educational experience.I feel all of these issues are fixable though and on balance I think this was a very good course.",4
"Quite an useful course for Excel application in business decision-making. But I think the final project is a little more difficult than weekly assignments. And only Quiz 1 has some hints about the potential problems we might come across during the quiz. The linear regression part, especially multivariate linear regression, need more explanations how to derive the matrix in Excel. Even though I followed every steps and referred other classmates' discussions, I cannot work out the matrix with Excel. So sad :(",4
"Fascinatingand slightly scary! Anyone who votes should watch these lectures. Some of the ""correct"" quiz answers are dodgy (illogical factually incorrect) but don't let this discourage you. Also, accepting peer marking is not for those with fragile egos or low frustration levels.",4
Last section was tedious. Access to a year long graphlab licence was nice though especially since I graduated as an undergraduate in 2014 and am no longer a student.,4
Very interesting,4
"Great course! I started learning Python for the first time, and It is also basically my first programming language experience. The videos, explanations and examples are very good, well structured and easy to understand. However I miss more practical exercises and more worked videos with the solutions specially after the week 5 when the subject gets a bit more complicated. Perhaps the solutions should be locked/unlocked after students submit their solutions ?! I don't know if that is possible but that would be great, specially for students who wants to continue with this specialization. Also for the record, I am a mom of a 5 year old that is only part time in the kindergarten, and I was able to successfully complete the course. I hope that can be used as a motivation for all students out there, independent of your age or your background, you can learn how to program! :D",4
"i am very happy as i was perusing the course despite the hard time i got while completing it, i earned a lot of skills from the course and am lucky that it helped in what i am doing currently because it touched many areas where i needed to apply a course outside, now that you did it online, it has saved me alot, the videos i downloaded for revision purposes... thank you so much for that.............",4
Liked this course. It helps to make sure character is central to the plot,4
The videos were informative but i didn't feel like we used the concepts from the videos very frequently.,4
Great general overview for those with little to no familiarity with personal branding. I love the instructor's wit and humor.,4
"This was a good course, no doubt about it. But i felt, that the subject needed more depth that the course framework allowed. I would have liked if it had a part 2 for this course for people who wanted to go little more hands-on in this subject.",4
Good course. I totally recomend it,4
Some parts of the course were either not well explained or too rudimentary in relation to the quizzes.,4
That was a very great introductory course on philosophy...,4
"Great course, great professor and great TA in community discussion. Can't give 5 stars as course introduction and content are not really matching. As per introduction anybody can take and learn this course, but indeed it is far from reality. If you don't have good math and statistic background then you better learn them first...I personally learnt a lot from this course even though could not get the certificate. Thanks everyone.",4
Great course. Especially enjoyed the introduction to Simscape.,4
The course is helping to understand a lot about academic research.,4
First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :),4
Great for an overview of the different aspects of data science.,4
This course is helpful,4
best course for a database beginner.,4
Very complete and useful. Perfect course to improve your knowledge about Sinusitis quickly.,4
"I like this course because of its step by step explanation and real computing problems. On the other hand the last exercises is a bit boring for me especially. I hope I will finish this course . I also want to recommend to everybody who is just started to learn computing, may be you must be good in English.",4
"Good course, I guess I knew a lot going in, but it was still useful and gave me reassurance on the ways I studied. Really good for students getting back into school.",4
Very good course with a professional instructors and hoping to enrich it with many other examples for different rules,4
Assignment 5 could have been explained clearer.,4
"Thank you so much Prof for guiding us through a difficult yet an interesting topic. The course is well arranged in the way the choosen cases make it easier to understand the statutes, though it not that easy. I wish the course had brought in more international cases as the non-American students like me might be more intersted in.I love this course, as well as the T- shirts and the tux :)",4
Good course!,4
"Great course, awesome professor, I wish it would include more wiring and actual projects in the making, just to get the bigger picture.",4
"It is a good course, you work a lot but the teachers show you enough to learn",4
Great professor wonderful introduction to computer science/coding-1 start due to some confusion with updates to the final exam assignment,4
good course!,4
Very good course. But the final test was too difficult. Almost impossible without external help for people like me with no experience in programming,4
"A great insight into rural and urban management which could be greatly improved with more challenging (longer) assignments. Great video material and instructors, but I would have enjoyed writing and peer assessing more in-depth articles as opposed to condensing as much information as possible into a simple 200-400 words.",4
"Nice Course, well structured.Only issue faced was with Grader not letting to use Rails 5, please be aware of this and use Rails 4.2.8 and save some time. :)",4
"Solid class, good overview and a useful final project. Very informative for learning financial analysis.",4
"Nice course, but need more detailed one for those new to statistics.",4
"Interesting course for those who want to learn a bit about managing their money, credit/debit cards, loan, insurance...generally everything we need when planning/reorganizing our life.This course can be easily taken by someone who's not familiar with economics/finance.",4
Very much enjoyed the course; the instructor used good examples and the content was relevant and aligned well with the subject matter. Enough examples and quizzes to reinforce the theories. I'm looking forward to follow-up with the 2nd course.,4
"Very comprehensive on all aspects on drug addiction, though a bit too difficult for those without any medical or biological background knowledge. More animations / diagrams for illustration would make the course better.",4
The course is is targeting total beginners in programming. The material is very basic and much topics are not even touched.,4
"It would have been nice to use more complex data analysis, as used in the second course of this specialization, in order to build the final model.",4
"Very useful for learners who do not have a background in Data Science or, Software engineering",4
"Lots of interesting facts about learning, inspiring experiences from guest speakers, and some useful tips to be enhance your learning.",4
Good course.,4
"This course consists of many beneficial suggestions. If you apply them in your life, most probably you'll allocate your time more efficiently and more purposefully.",4
"Nice course. However I do not understand why javascript is treated in a way that separates it absolutely from its web-related applications (it is treated as a general purpose programming language, which it is nowadays, especially once node.js came to the fore, but still - it is primarily web language and it would be better to treat it as such, even more so when the rest of the course is focused on html and css.",4
"I found the course really useful and informative and the teacher was very enigmatic and engaging. My only comment would be that perhaps the teacher goes through the slides slightly too quickly at times,as I found myself often pausing to read them. Excellent course though.",4
excellent tactics to influence people .,4
Great format and which was easy to follow.,4
Give nice practical tips which are helpful for managers. Explain the hiring process. Share best practices.,4
"The course was well organized and structured.It was a bit complicated to get the submission process starting, due to the patches necessary.It is a very nice course to demystify machine learning algorithms.",4
"Great, it's very helpful and you learn a lot of things that will help you in classes",4
good course,4
"I could give you 5 stars if you issue the Statement of Accomplishment to students who passed this course by free, at least... Anyway, the course was so great and interesting to me ! Thank you so mu",4
lots of mathematics and it's challenging,4
very good material for beginners,4
Good & useful course but with some errors.,4
It was good,4
helpful,4
"Excellent experience. Material, instructor and pace of the course were really good.",4
Great material and insights,4
A great way to revise grammar an punctuation from scratch!,4
The majority of the lecture videos were engaging and the structure provided you to move at your own speed.,4
I think it could have been more challenging and have had more material. There was too much introductory material in the first two weeks.,4
Great course that teaches you the basic for a good child nutrition,4
Great perspective for new managers.,4
A good course for persons those who are employed as in security role to an any organisation. I appreciate the method of distance learning to all on online. Thanks.,4
This pretty good but maybe should explore more than just theory septma chords blues and jazz encganche something that although is very good explanation leaves you anelando something more modern.,4
"The course was great. The videos and assignments were clear, well paced, and the forums were useful in getting questions answered. The lecturer made the material easy to understand. I've taken down one star just because I think potentially more ground could have been covered in the course, and the quiz and assignments were quite easy (in other words, could have been more challenging). Great experience overall though!",4
Fantastic course that gives the basic notions of cryptography. Both practical a theoretical tests are very useful.,4
This is a great capstone project. It requires the student to really have an understanding of the concepts learned throughout the specialization and apply them to build a prediction app. There is very little guidance asides from the discussion forum which could be discouraging at first. Otherwise I would've rated it 5 stars.,4
My advice for everyone is to take this course because i find it Really useful.,4
The content is covered in great depth in this course but pre-reads may help as the course moves up a few notches in technical content.,4
Great use of examples. I was not thrilled with peer-reviews as some people may give you bad scores with no explanation and/or they may be wrong in their understanding/interpretation of the course material/assignment.,4
Really nice course to clear the concepts regarding the new existing technologies and all the related terms. The tests and mid lecture questions really helped in testing the grasp of the course.,4
"This course is a wonderful nexus between east and west, between science and religion, between intuition and reason and between all those dichotomies, the false ones and more! It is just a shame that discussion forum moderators have become petty tyrants given censorship powers. At least, that was how it was last time I was bothered enough to try to get this stuff. One star subtracted, but it should be more given discussion is the only way really to do philosophy. Only one will do though because I guess it is a systemic problem and that it probably doesn't affect those of you who aren't borderline trolls who imbeciles easily mistake for the bad kind.",4
"Good class, good lectures. The plot devices taught are very specific, but helpful for beginning writers for whom conflict, and movement are not easy. I'm a beginning writer and I struggle with finishing a story because at some point I just think, well now what? what's supposed to happen?The class helps you push the characters into conflict, and make choices, which is the heart of a good story.My only complaint - the assignments were so structured that they were tedious. the peer reviews in this class were also painful. Reading other people's work, I felt like perhaps we needed less structure and more space to practice simpler techniques.But overall, i'm using what I've learned in my writing, and its definitely helped!",4
"Good Course for someone wanting an overview of techniques. You would not be building something very cool after this. Course assignments are not very challenging, some good questions must be included.Some mathematical part should be there. Expecting it in other courses in specialization.",4
This course give the basics for Machine Learning principal algorithms. It is very clear.,4
Great.!!! But if the content would be more. I find it unfair for a topic of such importance to be given so less attention. People will also respect it if the content would be more than it is right now...!!,4
"I very much enjoyed the thoroughness of Dr. Susser's explaination, the slow and clear manner of his teaching and the structure of the course into small, short videos. This allowed me to complete the course in small doses through my busy",4
The Fundamentals of Management is a good introduction into this area of knowledge.,4
"Good course, material needs more coverage in programming assignments. For example monads and futures were not covered.",4
Give good introduction into how we go about making a green and sustainable city.Provide some interesting insights.,4
"This course helps in understanding the basic and overall concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScripts",4
"This course gives a good introduction to programming and computer graphics. It's well structured and well taught. Since I can already program in C#, I was hoping there would be less emphasis on learning to program and more emphasis on the graphics side. I would also prefer it if the platform for the graphics was the latest technology most commonly used by industry and I'm not sure Monogame is it. However, the lecturer was brilliant and it's a course you can enjoy doing!",4
Thoroughly enjoying prof. Estrada's course. he Witty Prof. vs Student notes is a very good read.,4
"This was the first MOOC I ever signed for and I wasn't disappointed. Far more complex, detailed and demanding than I had expected.... which suited me perfectly.Although brilliantly researched and scripted, Professor Germano's detailed input is spoiled by his unecessarily academic style. I found that his tendency to accumulate endless lists of adjectives had an unfortunate hypnotic effect.I very much like the material presented by Kurtis Schaeffer, especially his contribution on the development of Buddhism in the US. His interviews were well-conducted and his remarks always to the point.Interesting - and again complex material from Clifford Saron who managed to caputre the attention of my rather non-scientific brain. Very well presented material and a pleasure to listen to him.The input from the Tibetan participants was more accessible to non-specialists, straight to the point and very refreshing.The work done by the meditators was brilliant and probably what I had been looking for when I registered for the course. I feel that I now know just enough to pursue the practices on my own. It all feels very new, a little bit scary, quite exhilarating and luminous.Some of the interviews were more interesting than others but they all contributed to broaden the scope of the course.I only give 4/5 to the MOOC because of the poor quality of the subtitles. Not being a native speaker and not used to hear American English, I had to rely on them. They were so bad that, at times, what was written was exactly the contrary to what was being said. Hardly any proper names or foreign words were spelt correctly either. Beware !The course has introduced me to a new world and I will definitely pursue my new-born interest in Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. I will also sign up for more MOOCs in the future. Overall an extremely positive experience indeed. I am looking forward to seing you again for the 'Greater Vehicle'.",4
"All the topics are quite interesting and surprising (and I mean every one of them), but all are treated like popular science with little insight. I had to read elsewhere to fully understand some topics such as reaction-difussion systems. All in all, I wish there was a version of this course for those of us who have no fear of mathematics.",4
"The HDL syntax I felt was a bit fiddly, and sometimes hard to find the relevant technical details such as language definitions in the videos, but overall a very interesting and enjoyable course. Happy to pay for it despite it essentially being available free.",4
Very good!!! Excellent!!!,4
Awesome course,4
great course,4
"Very good, well-paced course. It will help you grasp the complexity of the structural issues that triggered the Global Financial Crisis, which rocked the world. I would suggest you complement it by reading some of the many books that have been written about it, say, ""Too Big to Fail"" (Andrew Ross Sorkin), ""The Big Short"" (Michael Lewis) and, of course, ""Stress Test"" (Timothy Geithner).",4
"This course is totally recommended for developers and architects no matter the programming language you use.In my opinion, the only thing that I missed was a project for the penetration testing week.Contents are very well teached and the interviews were awesome.",4
The course is very well organised.Ideas are clear and precise.Not too much talk to say a little.,4
This was a very easy course and not too daunting considering the topic. I liked learning pronounciations of the words and the basic vocabulary. A great starter course.,4
Decent start to Engineering,4
Useful primer on applying inclusive principles across spaces,4
"This is a great course! I particularly liked the mix of general and specific information provided- the course provides a overview of the physical and governance aspects of municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and then goes on to focus on the treatment options for the bio-waste stream, which accounts for a large proportion of MSWM in development countries, and for which processing and treatment is still not well-developed or institutionalized.",4
"Well done. A couple minor issues with a video upload error, but overall a very well done and informative course.",4
Really good course,4
the last exercise is bugged (5.2 is supposed to be 5.1),4
Practical knowledge.,4
its a detailed and the lectures are good at explaining the complex concepts in easy way to understand,4
Sometimes boring and I felt like the quizzes were just worded in a tricky way rather than really assessing learning. Otherwise fine.,4
Its good start of for this course.,4
"Brief and clear, very easy to understand",4
It's completely straightforward to learn and understand. Thanks for your enthusiasm.,4
Very nice and enlightening course. I totally recommend it!,4
"Lively, and more practial",4
"It´s ok, but could be better.",4
Very good class. Need to have some knowledge of Java ideally.,4
"This was a very instructive course, videos are very clear. I think that one thing that can be improved is practice, I would love to have more practice to get better all the concepts (altough I know that it is very difficult).",4
"very broad perspective, up to date information, useful links and videos and good lecturers in general. Thank you for the insights and knowledge.",4
Good course for working professionals especially Engineers.,4
Very well explained and easy to follow.Learnt a lot from this course,4
Excellent and informative,4
This was a tough course and I actually moved to another schedule. I think a sixth week on using excel to solve problems would have been worthwhile.,4
Excellent introduction to the world of Android. Crisp and well-delivered lectures.,4
This course helps me to understood the complexity of moving to the cloud and to learnt Best Practices and Guidelines can help me to define roadmap to cloud.,4
Good teaching and good materials to have. This is one of the best courses you could have in the Internet.,4
"Not simple, interesting course! Thank You Coursera!",4
Applicable to real life situation.,4
"A very good course, expecially for the MATLAB part. They can improve with more assignment in MATLAB and with some more theoretical stuff, like more types of trajectories, more types of controllers and so on. However, is one of the best course that I attended online in a few years. I absolutely recommend it.",4
"I really liked that there were multiple instructors. Their French accent was a bit hard to understand sometimes: 'asseta-location' vs 'asset allocation'.Good historic overview of how risk management evolved over time, and good ideas and solutions to manage risk.",4
"Very good, thorough and interactive course on portfolio management and construction!",4
"Simple, great start, could have been a little more profound though. Great start, no doubt.",4
"In this course, there was a slide presentation with audio recorded in a classroom. This part of the course should be replaced as soon as possible to offer better experience. As it is presented right now, with a loudy environment, it really doesn't match to the quality of the other courses.",4
"Decent introduction to SEO field. Low level, introductory course.",4
This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,4
The material seemed a bit hurried at times..but overall a great learning experience and the assignments were truly helpful,4
"I took this course with a special interest on the musical aspect, namely the blues, of course. In that regard the course is very superficial, but has some interesting stuff even so. The other aspects of literature, painting, and the more popular arts (kilts, oral traditions, etc.) where a nice surprise. This course gives a view of a cultural aspect of America that is very interesting and mostly unknown, particularly, I guess, to a non American. I advise this course to anyone who is interested in ethnology, folklore and popular art and music and is not already familiarized with the American South.",4
"I really liked it. Some of tje jargon was a bit technical though. But overall really appriated the opportunity yo learn,",4
"Simple and very straight forward, I belive this is the best way to give a starting point course",4
"I would like to have more materials. See more work, read/listen about more design movements.",4
Great course,4
"I like that is not only about dogs, but also on apes (including humans).Easy to listen to.Would love more articles or other reading materials in this course besides the book.",4
Too much comma.. Only the last week is relative to the writing,4
A complete overview of the communications mix.,4
Very good and complete course with a quite high level of examination.,4
The course was really interesting and provide diverse points of view about the way how we eat. I really like the different perspectives provided by the presenters.,4
Very interesting - the quality of the videos can seriously be improved though. Already with little effort by editing away the duplicate parts.,4
The course is good but the end of unit quiz are not accessible unless you pay.,4
"Quick overview of the Arduino platform. Since I was new to Arduino, it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively. The peer-reviewed grading process is something that can be improved.I think the course should have covered some more concepts in detail that are relevant to IoT devices - for example, interrupts and their usage, detailed discussion of the SPI protocol.Also, more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great.",4
"it's a good course but i think it would be better if they have it also in spanish and apart from that as a suggestion, teachers should talk a little slow, sometimes it's hard to understand some words because of it. apart from that it's a very good course",4
Easy to understand,4
"enjoyed this, as well as finding out I dont know as much as what I thought i did",4
"Although the course was quite good, it wasn't really relevant to me as it was very focused on the USA (especially the local seo part)",4
Enjoyed this. Lots of lectures by guest authors.,4
Excellent in content and delivery!!!!,4
"The course is structured and easy to understand with a lot of practice exercises. However, I use Minitab on a MacBook and there are differences in the layout and location of functions. I struggled to find certain functions; even googling did not help. I would suggest you incorporate instructions for Mac users to use software tools. Overall, the course is very informative and definitely adds value.",4
"It's a good introductory course. I would have expected some more ""meat"" on the bones, but still I have to remember this is the first course out of a series so most probably it is good enough.Teacher is good and, even for a non English speaker student as I am, it is perfectly understandable and clear.",4
"This was another strong course from Wesleyan, and well produced. However some of the weekly problems were vague and it was not clear exactly what was being sought or how they would be evaluated, as they have been very clear in the previous mini courses in this specialization.",4
A ton of great information and resources.,4
Excellent introduction to the field of Data Science.,4
"The course is very simple and practical,but a little short. Hope I can use the skills I learned in the course in my daily work and life.",4
"To be honest I believed that this course would help me understand better transgender individuals, but it didn't. It feels like the instructors assumed I already accept this condition without question, the course is thought provoking of course, but not as informative as I thought it would be. I am more open to learn more about this topic though.",4
It's everything I needed to keep running with Data Scientist Specialization preparing.Thank you so much for your support!,4
Was good but the support in the forums could be better.,4
"Great and very functional Course, with numerous Statistics to establish correlations.",4
"Very useful course and tools that help in real life but I think it needs more examples and in depth explanation for the toolsOverall , I enjoyed it and very helpful",4
This is a very good introductory course on the various aspects of addiction. I wish they would introduce a second part with more comprehensive information.,4
useful and it make sense in emergency,4
"Very well structured course. I would really appreciate if there are more video lectures. For someone like who is not from CS background, self-study topics can get really difficult.Apart from that loved it.",4
Excellent intro course with 3 semi-challenging and fun projects,4
"A very simplistic overview of necessary skills and helpful writing tips. The videos are a bit slow and the instructor stumbles over her words a lot, but the material is great.",4
Great course. Interesting stuff. Bit too much legal aspect to my taste.,4
Simple and basic intro to Python. Instructive interviews with Internet personalities.,4
Simplicity and good piece knowledge about fundamentals of food and related habits throughout the course keeps the person bound with the course.,4
"Nice course, gives a good overview about the language. Although I have found their introduction to html and css3 better.",4
"Refreshing your BasicsThe whole course is a just brushing up your basic math. The videos are brief and to the point, and problems make you use your brains and they are not right out of the video or any other reading material. I feel only Bayes and binomial theorem videos are not comprehensive and the problems a quite challenging.",4
"Great, informative class but way too many quizzes.",4
"The course itself is wonderful,very instructive, well organized, and easy to understand. My only ""complaint"" is that it is too simple. That being said, this course is the fundamental of the fundamental of python. Mastering this sole course is far below enough to wield python as a powerful data analyzing tool. Also, I think even though this is designed to be an intro course, for people like me who is a total rookie in the world of computer science, it should have mentioned, at least touched upon a little of what is algorithm, because there is no way we won't come across various algorithms in the future of learning computer science. I just think it'd be good to have a heads-up.",4
"it is the excellent course,and most helpfull to my profession",4
course is pretty good and everything is very simply explained but i gave 4 stars only because many things was repeated so many times that it was sometimes soo boring and i thought we will compute in python more.,4
good course for everyone,4
Really insightful. Especially the first 2 lectures.,4
i'm glad to joint this course thanks miss colleen.,4
The instructor way of guiding is highly commendable as a result the concepts can be easily comprehended.,4
I learned a lot and loved the dogggies and the professor's sense of humor!,4
"Knowledge obtained is very valuable, but teaching stuff should improve by solving more examples in detail.",4
"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples.",4
Intersting,4
"A pretty solid course, though there does appear to be a degree of cognitive bias regarding certain farming methods.",4
Not too much useful and practical knowledge. full of basic concepts,4
Great professor!This is first course that kept my attention until the end.Only thing that would make this course better is to help us a little bit less in our projects.,4
Even though the course talks about strategy a better tittle could be Game Strategy applied to Competitive Strategy.,4
"I really enjoyed this course, and as an Australian it is so exciting it comes form a domestic university. Thank you",4
"Honestly, I am absolutely delighted to have access to that course. Information is reliable, strong, you can have access to a huge number of articles, studies... It is well structured. My only regret, is that there is a lack of actual images of the actions and the process described.",4
"The content was too basic, but good",4
"This is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data structures in Python). I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues switching from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using py3x] Dr. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to work my 40 hrs /week and do the course, altho it took me two sessions to finish. Now fully completed after switching to the next later session. NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one falls behind; this is better for getting TA help in the forums when there is a problem. Thanks!(above is same as Class Central, below is new)How could it be improved? By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forums. I'd expect that switching auto-grade assignments & sample code to be py3.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it.",4
"It is good course. Very brief and practical. As always, the most important things is to practice in real life situation.",4
Good basic overview of financial practices and methods.,4
I finished the course and I think the course is a great first view of what engineering mechanics can offer to the students at the university. I am a mechanical engineer newly graduated at UFRGS and the course was a great experience to recall some of the content learned at the university.,4
Good course capturing the basics.,4
Complete course in order to have a clear overview of HW security. I would recommend it to all HW engineers or System Engineers as well.,4
"Amazing course, gives your a good introduction to arduino platform and C programming",4
"Very good introduction to machine learning. Concepts are well presented and explained, i would have preferred to use a Open Source library in the assignments, but is not bad to know how to use Graphlab, a very powerful tool, for sure!",4
I was able to complete 80% of the course in the first go. I found the presentation both interesting and current and will highly recommend for others who plan to learn or visit India.,4
it was short and concise python learning tutorials and i enjoyed it fully.thank you coursera,4
Good Course,4
Thanks for providing this wonderful course..,4
"Very good content and teachers. The video production was a bit poor though, but in general is a very good course and everyone who has difficulty learning should take it.",4
Great course. Very informational. Good start for anyone looking to know more.,4
Great course for Branding Insights!,4
Very informational. Seemed to be geared towards parents and caretakers.,4
Would be great if we get the feedback and reviews from lecturer or professor rather the from the peer reviews.,4
Nice explanation about need and its different aspect of Digital Analytic s.,4
Easy entry to international market or Asia Market. Hope you could enjoy the course!,4
Great course for those with little knowledge of international marketing.,4
This was a great introduction to the tools. Just don't expect to actually do any analysis yet.,4
"I enjoyed this course, but am still trying to catch up on the reading! :) I would have loved to see a few more weeks, with perhaps longer and more in-depth videos and more themes and examples. I",4
"I really enjoyed the perspective and things I learned. I thought I could have scored higher on the quizzes because I was saying the same thing as them, but just in a different way. I would recommend this course.",4
"through this course , you will have a better understanding for web data",4
Very useful course! Helped me clarify some aspects I was stuck on. It will also enable me to help others.,4
"Great course! Provides an excellent understanding of the possibilities of machine learning and key details to choose the correct analysis/project design. Only frustrating thing is that programming assignments can be quite frustrating in a way that isn't really furthering your understanding of machine learning. Of course, this is probably mostly due to the nature of programming.",4
Great content and great teacher. But I found the assignments and the quizzes not that great. I reckon the questions and corrections were a bit subjective and time consuming.,4
"Before I started this course, I used to do a lot of guess work while editing my essays. I relied on proofreading program to get review my essays. This course has helped me understand crucial parts of sentences; thereby, enabling me with greater confidence to edit my essays.Although this course is intended for beginners, it would certainly help experienced hands refresh their skills. Try it!",4
Could be improved. There is more need of involvement of mentors and TAs.,4
Teaches how to think about a problem more than the specific tools that can be used to solve them. Good practical examples.,4
"Good course, very arbitrary chosen topics though",4
Truly enriching stuff.,4
A solid course with lots of practical advice.,4
"Great course. Some week were tough others too easy, but general a very interesting course.",4
it's quite good I think. I learns a lot.,4
"Some of the information from video to video was repetitive. However, I learned a lot about how organic food is good for people and the environment. Additionally, it was great to see how children can get involved in the kitchen and i hope that any parents who watch this try to get their children to be involved with a small garden or helping to prepare meals. Hands-on is the best way for kids to learn!",4
Extremely hard. I took my time with this course. Please have some experience with Scala before you take this class. This is not an introduction to Scala. For all you that say it is....you are pissed off and bitter. This class is for those who have experience in the language.,4
"Smooth pace and each assignment related to further one is very helpful for understanding course material.while I think partial or helper should provide 2 or 3 extra example code in extra reading material to know when to use partial, when to use helper.",4
"More challenging Problem sets, as in the R Programming course !",4
"Great instructor, some really helpful learning here!",4
"nice class, learnt a lot",4
"I would have like a longer course about these arguments. Anyway it offers really a lot of examples, effective analytic tools and ispirations to develop innovation in the business.",4
A really basic course many programmers know all about this already.,4
Just awesome!,4
"Very good introduction to arduino programming and the platform in general. However i expected it to be a more in depth course, however i would recommended it to anyone who just bought an arduino for the first time.",4
The material is interesting and relevant. I found the assignments challenging and the review questions slightly lengthy.,4
clear and concise,4
Very informative and the information presented is much stuctured.,4
This course was a great informational course on the basics of market research and the market research model. I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs a refresher on the the research methods involved in data collection and analysis methods used in the industry.,4
interesting and not too easy,4
Great course! Congrats to the teacher!It was clear and I learnt a lot!,4
"I really enjoyed this course, thanks to coursera",4
"It's a great introduction to Software Product Management. Even though it's actually more of an introduction to the Specialization. But it's a great one! I just wish the instructors were a bit more clear on who the ""client"" usually is.",4
Walks you step by step getting you setup and familiar with the core software.,4
"Would be great to have the slides available for reference. Also, future iteration may consider going a bit deeper. I loved the examples given in the course. Many thanks!",4
Great course with good material and lecturer,4
I really like this course. Very nice introduction to ML. The only downside is that it would be nice to have some comments on how to implement the algorithms without using Graphlab,4
"I did this course as a parent of a dyslexic child. I thought it was brilliant and I made pages and pages of notes. It is well organised, engaging, and informative. I really liked the two presenters as well. They both seemed passionate about the topic and modeled good teaching in their explanations and advice. That said, I thought the assessment part of the course simply didn't work. It was far too narrow for anyone besides primary teachers and therefore excluded those who might be doing the course for other reasons. It doesn't matter to me, I don't need the certificate and I got a lot out of the course but for others it would be frustrating, I imagine. The quizzes too, for the most part, were a disaster. They were poorly written, confusing, and dishearteningly obscure. Otherwise, I loved this course and hope you will offer a follow up soon.",4
"There were some errors in the video playback, one entire lesson near the end seemed like it was skipped.",4
Excellent content and references to additional materials.,4
very good course. the exercises are very useful to review the material but it seems that rounding errors can make the difference between right and wrong.,4
"More tooled for High Schoolers, or those just entering into college. Very good course none the less.",4
The course was very interesting and inspiring,4
Excellent course material. Homework is a bit esoteric though.,4
"It has very good content, specially if you are looking for basic concepts, you can find those here, although it doesn't go deeply on them, gives you what you need to get started, it's a fast pace so you have to keep up, and use of side materials/web to complement the course.",4
"Even that I have studied Machine Learning before at college, you can get a little bit lost in the Maths, parameters and matrix sizes.Documentation with some theory and the equations would help a lot",4
"it's good and very helpful,and i enjoyed it",4
It is a great fundamental course.,4
I have lear,4
Great way to get started on the Data Science course with the right tools.,4
I have been playing for many years but there is always things to learn or re-learn. I did both during this excellent course. Hogarth goes at a moderate speed. Especially helpful was the fact Mr. Hogarth speaks slowly and clearly. How nice!,4
"Good fist MOOC experience. Pity the google hangout wasn't up but never mind. Would prefer more questions in the videos to check I'm listening attentively.Would also like to see a list of all the reading material in one place rather than per lectiure. Then I can go to each web page and save as epub usiing the crhome dotepub extension and copy to my ereader.Anyway you can streamline that kind of admin task would be appreciated. You ought to spruke ways to read the web pages, because reading it on a laptop or even tablet is a bit tedious. Also with the PDFs, some info on saving them as resizable PDFs would be appreciated.Course content was good and I like the coursera front end.Need someway to manage tthe growing library of reading material that accumalates not just with this one course but if you do multiple MOOCs over time,Thank!",4
I thought the active negotiations with other students were very effective...,4
Very good course about learning method,4
easy to understand and good explanation.,4
"I think the questions in this course do not map as well as they could to the lectures. But, overall it's very helpful.",4
"One or two of the assignments were very similar to assignments that were offered earlier in the specialization. Otherwise, the class was a great finale to a very well-done specialization!",4
"Great lecture, easy to follow with R studio. Assignment are moderately challenging.",4
"As someone with no introduction to programming at all, this course was easy to follow through and was a pretty good introductory course!",4
"Good material and strong overview of project management. The only improvement I'd suggest is the instructor needed to slow down the delivery of his presentations. His quickly moved through the slides at numerous points (especially with the clicker). Other than that, it was a good course.",4
"The course content is good, although it is very ""USA centered"". It is very good for people with small experience in the professional market, no just the games area, but all areas.Casey is a great teacher, he makes boring stuff be less boring.The only negative point of the course are the assignments. Again, like in the previous course, the assignments are too subjective, too personal, hard to do and evaluate.Unlike last course (Game Design), I really recommend this one, useful stuff.",4
"Ithink this course is unbelievably usefuland exciting but there weren't much information about educational method which was essentual,in my opinion. Thank you for your gripping course!!!",4
This course presents many alternatives to traditional models of business.,4
C,4
"Interesting topic, . but the videos are too long and sometimes lack of dynamism . I recommend the comparison with Science.",4
It is not an intro class. This course is challenging particularly when you are not an English Native. In this course the most frequently used model is binomial model that can be fairly dealt with in the Excel sheet.,4
It was good but sometimes I was thinking that some of the aspects could be explained quicker.,4
It is a very good course for beginners. Great platform to learn this new technology.,4
Great course! Useful but a little boring...,4
Good course for learning about how our bran works but the curriculum is slow-paced.,4
"I loved the manner in which the course contents were delivered. The course teacher know the art of articulation. He knows how to teach complex ideas in a simple manner without loosing its essence of the argument. I was so immersed in his lecture, one full night I watched his lecture and finished 80% course material. I wish I could deliver a lecture like it. A big salute to an inspiring teacher.",4
"Very complete. Covers a wide range of subjects. Prof. Gabriele transmits a really clear message. Their quality is unquestionable. But, the program lacks of more specific examples.",4
"Really good course! I liked the structure, the materials, and most assignments. I felt like I gained valuable knowledge; this is a good introduction to marketing today!",4
"Very useful and practical course. The teachers introduced the basic knowledge related to wind energy in every area. Plus the materials introduced out-of-class, I have a overall view about wind energy.",4
Good course for starters. Can be more detailed.,4
"The course was pretty well without problems, flaws bugs, so all went well and it achieved its stated aims in my opinion. I was beta-testing, so to say few or almost zero problems is high praise.",4
one the best backend development courses on the web . covers a lot of topics . and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates (a little) when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,4
It would be helpful to work on a complex programming assignment at the end of the course,4
The only complain is that it kind of feel uncompleted,4
Fantastic course except for the quiz questions. Many of them can be interpreted in a way that an answer different from the intended one can work too.,4
"The section about Beta-Binomial Conjugate is taught very fast and unless the student is quite familiar with Beta and Gamma distributions, it makes it very difficult to follow the course.",4
good course,4
"<p>Pretty clear demonstration, but everything taught here is too simple.</p>",4
very interesting and worth using time loving it!,4
"The only missing point I would say about this course is how to deal with skew data and/or outliers. Although it is not specific to ""cleaning data"", I think there is a good opportunity there to at least give some hints on this subject",4
"Very good introduction to philosophy. The amount of work and care that was used to create this course is clearly visible in the videos with the speakers, backgrounds, video and sound quality. Thanks very much!",4
"It's a very good course to start learning HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. To get the experties suggested material is useful.",4
"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package.",4
"Electric professor! Great course, without doubts.",4
"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch.But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful.",4
nice teaching,4
"I only dislike the fact that wasn't very clear the instructions for the final project, every work I reviewed and also mine, were very different, I think that everybody understand a different thing, and that wouldn't happen if the instructions were clear.",4
"Thank interestny course, get for yourself a new required information, a mild form of lessons .Moya difficulty only in translation. Thank you.",4
nice course with a good instructor.,4
Very informative.,4
"A nice introductory course. For people that already have some Teaching or Language Acquisition under their belt, there may be some feeling of review. However, there is also valuable information and fresh angles on how to look at some aspects of language learning and teaching.",4
"i had no idea of swift, or even not much idea about oop. Got good idea of swift.. assignments can be improved.",4
Great for learning python basics,4
"I can see the improvement in myself and in the other students in the peer reviews. This course took me a little by surprise by how fun it was, I hadn't expected it. I recommend this course, especially to foreigners who want to learn how to use the English language.",4
"I really enjoyed this course, it was very helpful and exciting.",4
"so far i have completed week 1 course its quite interesting, and feel like reading a research thesis",4
"This course has given me a general approach should be used as javascript, and helped me implement solutions without the need for utilzar framewors javascript.",4
Great introduction to using techniques in previous course with online data.,4
Useful and insightful,4
Well done MOOC. Material was very clearly presented by excellent instructors.,4
A good course that gave me a good refresher on at least what I grew up with decades ago. It also introduced me to two that I am aware of but have not read them. I especially like 王阳明 whose philosophy I resonate with. I checked out his work 传习录 from public library thereafter and am a firmer believer in how I would continue to conduct my life working with others.无善无恶心之体 有善有恶意之动知善知恶是良知 為善去恶是格物,4
"Introduction to Personal Branding is a good course. Professor Barker is full of energy and she is also quite funny. She introduced us to a very large topic in a short amount of time and based on her agenda, succeeded. Taking Introduction to Personal Branding prepared me for my current course, Career Brand Management, where a lot of the terminology is mentioned repeatedly. While it isn't as thorough as my courses, I felt good about entering the course knowing I was introduced to a lot of familiar material in Dr. Barkers course. Thank you.",4
I missed something more about the last lessons. Some achievements like in the previous.,4
"A very basic but thorough introduction to the world of psychological first aid. The class includes a single sample intervention that is referenced at the end of every unit. The actors (including Dr. Everly himself!) seem very well-rehearsed, and this single encounter makes for an excellent template for how to apply the RAPID model in real life!",4
This is excellent course on basic data structure. I will encourage you to take this course.,4
"Nice course! there is only one suggestion I want to send you, the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course. So I hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks.",4
"How to Change the World is a good introductory course to create awareness about some of the most important issues of our world nowadays. The lectures, leaded by Prof. Michael Roth, showcase interesting conversations with other experts about their attempts to make positive change in the world, and the weekly assignments are a good way for students to synthesise the learning of each week.As a downside, I found very little participation in the discussion forums. I would have liked to discuss more about the different topics of each week. Also, the lectures, while interesting, were sometimes a bit long-winded, and I did not like the fact that some conversations were divided over several videos.In general, I have enjoyed the course and doing the assignments, and also reading and reviewing my peers' work. I would suggest re-editing the video lectures in a bit more synthesised and self-contained pieces, and perhaps to spice up the discussion forums with some initial threads by the moderators.Finally, I would like to say thanks to Prof. Michael Roth for its incredible effort in bringing together all the guest speakers and for making available this course for everyone in the world.Miguel R. C.",4
Great way the info is presented. When we get the summary quizzes we sometimes get questions on subject matter that we did not cover and need to research the answers. I do like the assignment so far as it puts into practice what we have learned during the module,4
Good to learn the basics of web development,4
"That's a great course for those who want to broaden their horizons in mathematics. Learning process involves a huge amount of useful information from different areas, such as linear algebra, fields and rings theory, and many more.But I'd like to share some thoughts with possible readers of this review.1) A learner should have a really strong mathematical background. I would say that it's a graduate-level course, and I couldn't recognize that from course description. Otherwise,2) One needs a HUGE amount of time to learn all the material thoroughly. Just to clarify, I'm changing my job now, so I fortunately have a lot of free time. And I spend almost ALL of one for this course! :) That's great, I'm ready to do that, but how many people have that kind of possibility? Amount of given information is enough for a separate specialization in Coursera terms, so maybe it would be good to split this course into several separate ones.. for sure, it fits into a standard HSE university course. But I can say that I do have some background in maths, but a number of years it was unused, so it takes time to recover a lot of things. Just my thoughts, but I see how discussion in forum is fading away, guess it means that a lot of people start giving up.3) And finally I would suggest to add some small quizzes within lectures as it's done, for example, in 'Learning How To Learn' course. In my opinion, it can help learners to catch more from videos.So, 3 weeks left to finish this course, so I'm starting a next quiz! Thanks to everyone and happy learning! Or teaching :)",4
"Strict re-quiz structure and odious ""None of the above"" options, but superb instruction.",4
"It was a great experience!!! I recommend it, i learned a lot",4
"Haven enrolled in this short online course in Chinese for Beginners has really helped me. Now a Masters student at BNU, it's easy for me to communicate on campus and even outside campus. It makes it easier for a native to give you help since you can say something in Chinese. I am amazingly thrilled with my ease of lifestyle in Beijing; thanks to COURSERA",4
"i will thanks to management, i really need to learn this course because my FYP is based on this course",4
Clear and simple. Suitable for beginners.But most of the contents are rather too intuitive.,4
"Great of individuals looking to introduce themselves to Python or reintroduce themselves. If you have a basic understanding of Python, you might wish to look elsewhere. The course is well taught and enjoyable videos make the learning fun.",4
"Great insight. However, the treatment of SVM (Support Vector Machines) was a bit too light for my tastes.",4
Course is good but the early weeks need to be more challenging. 70% of the work was in the last week.,4
A very introductory course that helps in getting an idea on how to write for young readers. I found it quite useful.,4
course was really good. this will be very useful for begineers in embedded systems and IOT.,4
"For me, some of the stuff was really helpful but some of the stuff I already knew of.",4
"This course provided me with right direction and attitude for all my future learning.Thank you!Although the material and the style of presentation was absolutely excellent, the 1 star off is only due to some technical glitches of the course presentations(mostly Coursera I guess) - no sound or no image on videos, sound and video not synchronized.",4
Its Awsome...,4
"It is a very hard class for anyone who has never programmed before, in order to complete the assignments you have to look for a lot of extra information.",4
I thought this was a well presented course with good coverage of the material. Only thing holding me back from giving it a five start rating is a few errors in the quizzes need to be fixed.,4
A very nice approach to applying design thinking in any business field. Recommended,4
It teaches us the techniques in the history. very useful,4
Great advice o writing best practices. Done with humor and memorable quotes.,4
"A well delivered, concise yet adequately comprehensive introduction to policy production.",4
it is amazing for learning the very fundamentals of the guitar.,4
"My first completion of a Coursera course, the materials are interesting. The JavaScript part of the lecture is kinda overwhelming, I wish we could have more practice and some more in depth or involved homework to help me understand the material and practice them.",4
"It was Ok! The preofessor has a good style of teaching, but the depth of material could have been better and the assignments more challenging.",4
It's a great course.It changes the perspective of the way we learn and the ways which we thought obsolete were the best ways to learn. The best course that I had ever taken.,4
"If you are at university (PhD student, academic, researcher, etc.) then you kind of know most of the ""theory"". However, practising R was a huge plus (personally, I liked the Week 4 task).",4
It's good!,4
Excellent course anybody who wants a deep understanding of the private equity sector.,4
The ideas are a little stretched but nevertheless a fun and enlightening course.,4
Is a grate course. I have already rated it. It would be good an International Humanitarian Law and a Cours about the Sea International Law. Specially Sea International Law.,4
"A very interesting and useful course. I had some difficulty distinguishing some of the biases - it is like some of them are nested within others, which makes choosing the one that is most relevant to a situation quite tricky.",4
i hope i can get scholarship and get a better job after complete this course,4
I really enjoyed this course!,4
A good refresher well explained though good examples.,4
Short course with some good ideas and examples.,4
Great course information and content ! Very interesting ! Unfortunately there is a peer graded assignment which 3 classmates must grade. Although two of my classmates gave me all passing grades one classmate gave me all 0's and didn't really justify why; which made me have to re submit my assignment. Thankfully 3 other amazing classmates saw the quality of my work :),4
"Good content with a nice bit of character and playfulness from the professor. Be prepared to find your own ways to practice and solidify the skill, though.",4
"This part I liked less than the first. Less substance, and I do not like somebody replacing Mr. Odersky as a lecturer",4
"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down (questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer). However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful.I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently (only theory, no hands-on material). In general, hands-on material was great and useful.",4
good but too easy...,4
More insight about SEO tactics and SEO history. The breakdown of topic into sessions were well-defined and easy-understanble for amateur like me !,4
"The skills taught in this course are fantastic and I'm sure using them will blow my colleagues' minds away. However, I must say that the lectures on Rcharts and other interactive plot builders sound kinda sloppy, poorly prepared. I know the documentation for those packages is bad and it takes effort to figure out what they do, but that is precisely why a well-prepared lecture would be so useful. I would also talk about license, since we have been dealing with packages that are completely open for use, but these have some restrictions.",4
Easy to understand,4
"Very good course, but lectures could be more tuned onto the home assignments. A lot of independent work for me at least. Teacher is very good.",4
Good brief overview of class at the 100 college level. Would be good for someone about to go back to school for undergrad.,4
Just taking part of the course material was rewarding. A good basic introduction to HRM,4
"Somewhat hard, but rewarding.",4
Great,4
"Can be very challenging if you aren't well-versed in the various problem-solving tricks used for MechE problems (how & when to choose axes/reference frames, how to visualize the motion intended by the sketch, where/when to assume friction exists or does not exist, etc). Discussion fora are relatively inactive for assistance.",4
"Good overview of regression modeling. Would have liked to see more on logistic regression. But that's ok, can read it on my own.",4
"A nice refresher for people who already have a linguistic background, and a nice introduction for beginners also. My problem was all the weird questions about the informants. Some of the questions are really hard to understand which makes them impossible to answer. I'm glad I took the course though!",4
I would like to receive feedback about my wrong answers after I approve the course. I really would like to know what were the correct answers.I think that this is really important because I can learn of my mistakes.,4
"very fun, informative and interesting. definitely recommend to any one interested in dinosaurs",4
"A very good review on punctuation and tense. However, I think the course is a little too simple. I hope that the class could cover more grammar topics in depth.",4
"very well designed course ,very helpful.",4
"Good course for anyone starting the journey of research. The course gives you an overview of the whole process in simple and easy way. Research work is challenging, however, this introductory course gives you some comfort when you hear the research scholars.",4
"I learned a lot in this course about all the ways one can find info online about your product/business. Some of the guest lecture videos didn't hold my attention all that well, but I'm glad we had their perspective.",4
"The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R. This being said, I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth (with further practice) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery. I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy, and only now (after completing the course here on Coursera, reading the textbook(s), and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R.This being said, the course was very well organized, had great examples, and excellent lectures (although the audio could be clarified by quite a bit using a higher-end microphone, preamp, interface, and affordable audio production software such as Reaper to clarify the voice).",4
Great course- organized in a very friendly form ( a lot of others courses are simply boring and after few minutes of listening to the lecture you simply can't stand it ). Here the lectures are relatively short ~10 min and focused on single topic.Looking forward for the next course in the specialization.,4
Nice and helpful course,4
A very good course that introduces you to a lot of photography related concepts and terms. The assignments are very hands on and fun to do. The course also gives you great pointers for choosing a new camera!,4
Very crash course that gives you a taste about the different aspects of data science and makes you want to dive in the specialization program right away!,4
"Very well presented, structured and selected material, easy to follow, relevant and interesting. Quizz problems are well thought through and have a reasonable degree of difficulty and length.",4
Good course with both theoretical and practical content.It lacks instructor and staff support.,4
"A very nice well-rounded intro to guitar.The amount of work really rises towards the end, but it does pay off.The only issue I have is with this course is the barre chords. They are dumped nonchalantly on the learners and we're just expected to pick them up. This part is very hard on the beginners.",4
I've really enjoyed this course and I enjoyed following the lectures. I feel a need to do something real a sustainable world.,4
Overly theoretical in my opinion.,4
"Very insightful, although very theoretical. It is great to create awareness of different strategical concepts and how they are applied, but not enough details in how it would actually play out in a real scenario between different entities. Kept me wanting to learn more though, which is a very good thing ;).",4
"A general introduction for people who have watched Kunqu yet also would like to know ""how to appreciate Kunqu"". The part that those masters presenting the acting, singing, etc. is always the best.",4
"I really enjoyed the course. It was a very good introduction to a lot of topics in machine learning. The quizes and assignments were manageable but not too easy.However, there were no written course materials to print out. Thats the reason I only rate the course 4 stars.",4
"Good introductory course! It gives an overview of the global financial market-as the course name suggests. The math problems are a bit hard though. Improvement can be made for the pop up quiz during the lecture--it suddenly cut the lecture; thus disrupting my concentration. It think it needs to be properly placed during the lecture so as to help in reviewing the lesson, not disrupt the student's focus.",4
"Practical hands-on real life examples, excersises and assignments!",4
I think whole course was well explained but sometimes I had a hard time to get a key point in videos.,4
Very good Course. Best explanations through good examples. If assignments were programming rather than objective it would have been much better.,4
Interesting course but the lectures are lacking in imformation. I would recommend as long as you don't mind a,4
This course is good for beginners!!,4
The programming assignments need to be more challenging and have more variety.,4
"I really enjoyed this course overall (and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already), but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments. It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors/teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues, especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people. But, I enjoyed the illustrations (drawings) and cute examples, and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera. I would probably give this course a 4.5 if possible, but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues. Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study.",4
Quick and general but useful and easy to understand. Thanks.,4
Useful for Beginners! Maybe a bit slow for people with experience in other programming languages.,4
The course is exceptional. However there are many errata that could be corrected but Coursera refuses to do so.,4
"this course is cool but not hard enough i think, it should cover more materials and it should be harder.",4
"This is a really straight forward, practical presentation of valuable information every professional will have to deal with.",4
Could be more engaging but consists of a whole lot of relative information.,4
"a very good course, the instructor is funny and very straight forward.the only thing that need to be improved is the assignments, they need to be more challenging ^_^",4
"Great course! It was difficult, but mostly due to my lack of basic knowledge about statistics. A primer lesson would have been great. But with some research on some topics on my own I could complete the course with a sufficient understanding of the concepts.I found the lectures and assignments to be very clear and concise. Props for the professor ;)",4
"Very interesting subject matter, presented very well",4
"This course gave a very refreshing outlook towards the whole definition and concept of creativity. The videos, readings, articles and assignments were all very well thought out and makes you go wide as well as deep in your thoughts. Above all it makes you realize that creativity is indeed for everyone :)",4
Very informative course. I'd recommend anyone to take it. I did feel like the later modules were not as interesting as the earlier ones but that's just my opinion. Some might find them really helpful. Regardless this course has changed how I learn now and in the future. Thanks guys!,4
"Solid entry level course to dog cognition. I would have preferred that it focused more strongly on dogs, and payed less attention to how information about dogs can help us understand humans. The section on general domestication was phenomenal, and the bonobo to chimp comparisons were incredibly helpful. I would have appreciated deeper analysis on what each of the five cognitive domains for dognition were, and what they actually meant.",4
"Despite working in financial industry, and having a very good understanding of the crisis. they way the course has been structured to disseminate the information gradually and structurally really appeals to me. I have learned things I did not know, and to me that is the",4
"An absolutely great course that transformed my career development efforts from uncertain and uninformed to focused and well thought-out. The topic lectures were relevant and practical and CDLs were challenging yet inspired deep introspection and evaluation which assisted to internalize the concepts and convert them into actionable tasks. Many thanks to Amy and Drs. Forte, Valeri, Rutigliano and Beckem.",4
Great content and movies. Would have been even better if the professor spoke a little more loudly and perhaps there were guest experts.,4
Very good course with great teacher,4
This course captures the overview of Big data modelling concept in a very simple way. I found this course very useful. Instructors are good to explain the concepts. Though it would be good to add one or two (add-on or optional hands on exercises) handson for graph and tree data modelling.,4
Very introductory course to Bootstrap!!,4
Great course if you have not seen any previous information about the subject,4
"Very interesting course with clean slides and good understanding of the key concepts. A bit more ""practice"" would have been better, but I still highly recommend this course for a basic knowledge in digital marketing.",4
"It's mostly very basic stuff, but even then it introduced me to concepts I wasn't aware of.",4
A very good introduction to programming for the beginners. I really appreciated it!,4
Very interesting through creative assignments you can learn and refine things about image telling.,4
"Energic lecturer. Love it! From how he teaches us, we can judge that he really loves calculus or maybe math in general is his passion.",4
this course is really good. i enjoyed a lot.,4
"Good exercises. Good, interesting, helpful teacher. short lessons. concrete instructions",4
There is no good explanation of how to calculate the equations given in the quizes which is why sometimes i had to fail to figure out how to solve one of the similar equations so I can understand and solve the others. Overall is good and understandable.,4
I'd like to learn a bit more about ASD.,4
Craig is such a professional sales-teaching that I learnt a lot from him. Now I'm confident to start pitching potential leads that might fit my business. Thank you!,4
Very basic introduction to data structures in Python,4
Interesting course,4
"Very interesting courses, with a good theory basis in portfolio manangement",4
I really liked the structure and the content of this course but I didn't like the assignment questions. The questions went into too much detail instead of questions about understanding the topic. All in all it's a great course for people who want to get into SEO!,4
"Very good like the 2 previous courses. It could have gone a bit farther though, but very clear explanations.",4
Very very good. Needs some clean up in the PowerPoints and perhaps a bit more elaboration with some concepts. The quizzes were a bit tricky where some of the questions hinged on a single word or phrase in the lecture.,4
Good course,4
"Good introduction to functional programming and Scala. Although, the lectures and assignments can get rather mathy (pointless proof of refactoring using maths, Pascals Triangle, Huffman Coding, Counting Change, etc) If you don't have a mathematical background, I would suggest getting the basics of programming down before starting this course so you have less to worry about.I found myself reading up about the maths behind some of the assignments before tackling them, when this could've been avoided with less mathematical assignments. I looked into the first assignment of the next module in the specialization and thought to myself: ""Why bother"" as it just continues the trend of solving more complex mathematical problems -- something rarely tackled as a professional developer.I would've liked to see the standard collection functions taught and used more frequently: map, flatmap, fold, etc.",4
Awesome course. Exams could have been a little tough to pass....,4
"This class had hard quiz.Sometimes it seemed very basic, but some are hard unless you read and learn really well. Great class/knowledge. Practical real-life examples help.",4
"The glitches with the autograder at the end were the only reason I didn't give this five stars. Otherwise, great course! Looking forward to joining CSS3.",4
comprehensive yet a bit too easy,4
Good course; very interesting. I would like to see the professor grade the course papers or at least review them instead of stric,4
"Teacher is good, also the contens are very interesting. However i felt the capstone must be clearer in order to follow the previous one. They have both the same situation, but there is something missing between capstone 1 and 2. Maybe it is the way it is conceibed, the questions were not clear at all.",4
Enjoyed the structure.,4
"I found it to be a very useful class on important topics in web analytics. The homework assignments are not very difficult and encourage learning instead of grade-seeking. Plus, Dr. Chuck is an engaging instructor!P.s. I gave it 4 starts because the assignments were a bit too easy at times. My feedback is to include advanced but optional assignments in future sessions.",4
It is a nice course for people who has zero knowledge about programming.,4
"I thought the videos for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the ""right"" ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optimal pandas approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade.",4
"I found this course to have very useful material and good, clear explanations. My only criticism is that the last of the four weeks has practically no content. There are no lectures and the only assignment is grading the assignments of other students, which at most takes 20 minutes.",4
"I liked the ""How I struggled"" and ""Challenge"" videos. The course itself was challenging to me and I learned a few object oriented programming concepts that can help me at work.",4
"I loved the course, although I think the instructions for various briefs should be more precise and/or someone should be available to clarify the instructions and answer any questions from students (regarding the briefs).",4
Finding optimal solutions for the assignments would have helped more,4
"It is a great course, simple yet complete. However, it would be nice if we had more contact with our lecturers, and if they graded our assignments instead of other classmates. They are not as experienced as our teachers are.",4
Good for begineers...,4
Very nice! Some things I felt that went too fast but in general it was great!,4
"Very well made, great contents. The only reason I removed a star is it seemed to me there was more topics in the quizes than in the course itself in the first part. It was a bit confusing and the quizes required to look up information on the internet and there was no real way to know these topics would be in the quizes. Otherwise, I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal.",4
very good. but in general needs more explanations in the videos andIf you introduce more languages it would be better,4
awesome course. like d way prof david taught,4
It´s good but really basic,4
Course content was very simple which helps a new-bee to get acquainted with python in an easy manner. Professor Chuck is also great.,4
So great but I found the last module about history of veterinary medicine overly long and boring,4
"I feel like this course, along with the other courses in this specialization, doesn't cover in-depth applications of supply chain management. The course material covers only the basics, and does not adequately prepare a student to take on a job in supply chain management.",4
I am just loving it! Thank you for all your effort.,4
"Great introduction to Pro Tools even for the seasoned amatuer who's been playing around with DAWs. I now have basic skills with Pro Tools, plus my editing and mixing skills have improved. This course won't make you a pro but it's a great introduction and well worth your time if you're a newbie or have stalled in your amatuer persuits. **thumbs up**",4
Clear speech in video and instructions.,4
suitable for newbie,4
A very interesting course with a lot of practice.I learn how IBM bluemix work. The weak point is that the assignment must be more clear and with more explication.,4
The course is very good. However the course covers only the basics of how to use python to access web data. It would have been good to add an assignment to use REST APIs in the real world scenario.,4
"It was great, though tough",4
Truly inspirational course with real life examples. Those who are seriously considering to become an entrepreneur MUST take this course.4 stars as there is very little to do for a person who is taking this course.,4
Really good accompliment materials for beginners!,4
Audited the course successfully :),4
"Very helpful, I love it!It would have been 5 stars if it had been longer.",4
"Interesting to acquire basics of TableauThen a lot of fundamental features are missing like interaction, Level Of Details, and so on",4
"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material.",4
"Good, but gives the very basics.",4
A great course. Has increased my knowledge tremendously.I will willingly recommend it to others.,4
It's an incredible course with detail explanations and interactive quizzes.,4
"good intermediate course that goes a little below the surface, and offers more than the absolute basics.",4
I liked this course very much because I could learn something new to support my professional life.,4
A very helpful course about learning and brain functioning,4
"Good survey of the material, but assignments are superficial and don't test thorough understanding.",4
"Learned ""real world"" skills from this course.",4
Great course with a lot of examples on integration with social networks and secure transportation layer.,4
Love this course. Would have liked a little bit more depth in the studies and science around the topics presented.,4
"This course is a pretty cool intro to the GraphLab Create library. However, I would have preferred something more challenging, even for a survey course.Though the discussion forums were generally very active (I posted at least one question that was answered by a TA very promptly), there was a question I had towards the end of the course that never got answered. I wasn't alone in this... many people were having a very similar problem.In general, I think the course was good. But, if you have even a very shallow familiarity with Machine Learning and/or Python, you may be able to skip this one and move straight into the Regression course.",4
Very helpful. I've learned a lot.,4
"The course was very enjoyable, nevertheless I would have expected to learn a little more about sound acoustics. The complementary exercises were helpful towards the understanding of the subjects, especially for the electronics parts.",4
"I think it's a very interesting course, well focused on the strategies to arrange an effective communication.",4
Quite informative for beginners.,4
The course is excellent to learn all the basic stuff needed to master the technique of Bayesian Data Analysis.,4
The course was great. Everything is explained simply yet with a great amount of detail. The staff was superb in their support and responsiveness. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the length. I feel like the JS/AJAX portion could/should be two weeks instead of 1.,4
"Quite interesting. Especially the way the studies were made and how they were evaluated. It would be nice that after such long time now, to include the results of the schools study.I was also expecting more details on the NND itself : food preparation, detailed food, recipes.",4
Very intersting course,4
Good course to polish up your statistics knowledge.,4
Very thorough and comprehensive course--all lessons are in easily-understandable English,4
"A great and fun way to learn fundamentals of programming and basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Exercises were simple and very good to reinforce what was learned on each session, plus they included challenge exercises for those who need something a little less basic.",4
"Quite good and interesting course, I would probably add a bit more diversity is presentations, tasks etc. But even as it is now it gives a very good insight.",4
"As a woman, I learned a surprising amount of stuff I never knew before",4
Good course. Accounting course was the best,4
A good start for anyone wants to know about data analysis,4
"Simply and clearly explained, good examples. Just what you need for a short review of the topic.",4
It was really informative..but need more examples and more pratical view.,4
i have fun with this course .,4
Nice introducing to python^),4
Should have discuss some of this material earlier in the course as introduction.,4
"It was a really nice course for a beginner in Python like me. The pace could have been better specially or people with prior programming experience Anyway, it was fun learning Python. The instructor was awesome.",4
"Very accessible course, with a wide variety of topics. It provides a good introduction to ML. The pacing of the course is good, and somewhat faster than e.g. WU's machine learning specialization (where linear regression and classification take up an entire module, instead of one lecture). In that sense, this course may be a particularly good fit for people that already have some working knowledge of statistics and (statistical) programming. Also, Andrew Ng is a very good and inspiring professor.In the programming exercises, there is a lot of emphasis on vectorization, which is very useful. However, once you've wrapped your head around that concept, many of them sometimes seem a little too straightforward to implement. Nonetheless, the applications are very cool, including e.g. computer vision and anomaly detection. The (free) software (Octave) is very intuitive and easy to use.All in all, an excellent course. If only there was an ""intermediate ML"" follow up by professor Ng.",4
Good for learning statistical analysis using real examples (bank credit card application) and hands on the data in the final project!,4
I found this course gave me great tools to improve my classes. Being a teacher is not something easy but with practice and great professor like the ones in this course we sure can give better things to our students.,4
"This is a great starter course for materials informatics. It covers a good amount of topics and uses a nice case study to reinforce digital representation of data, spatial correlations, principal component analysis, and regression. I really liked the examples of pyMKS. My only suggestions is it would have been nice to have more hands-ons use of pyMKS and sci-kit learn. This could have been accomplished through a course project or homeworks.",4
"There are a few mistakes that you need to look out for (check the discussion forum), but overall, this is a very good course!",4
"I did not watch every single video (I watched it initially for a school project so I had to cherrypick videos) but have definitely learnt so much from all the interviews that the professor has compiled for us and see from different aspects, e.g. political, legal, socio-economic factors, even literature, that have shaped our society's view on HIV patients.The professor has left very positive note and resonance for us to be aware of HIV and how to change our community by being aware of it. It is truly a meaningful course and I just want to give a huge thank you to University of Michigan for this MOOC.",4
great teacher and class; last exercise was tough!,4
Thank you for this course I have learned a lot!,4
better accent clean verbal this is how every course should be slow and steady,4
"The contents of the course are great and prof. Impey is a great communicator. The course is easy to follow, the final chapters on galaxies and cosmology are a bit more difficult but that is due to the nature of the subject and I applaud that the prof does not ""dumb it down"" or brushes over such difficult ans speculative subjects. I minor nuisance for me were the frequent songs and funny videos interspersed in the course content. It would have been better if they were separate from the main videos or otherwise could be easily skipped by people who don't have a lot of time. overall a great course!",4
Great examples and excercises. A good way to get into the graphic design. I enjoy every assignment and it gives a lot of ways to keep doing graphic design.,4
"Video lectures could be a little bit shorter by cutting basic explanations, for example, don't need to go thru the whole list oz numbers to see that each of them is smaller or larger.",4
Very helpful overview of the subject.,4
"Very good overview of machine learning. Doesn't go into detailed mathematical construction of the methods/techniques but the course does provide you with the overall/big ideas used in machine learning. If you are completely new to machine learning, definitely take this course! If you're from a different background (math/stat etc), this course will provide you with a good transition into machine learning.",4
Good quick general overview for a complete beginner. Wished it could have been longer with a bit more depth.,4
Very good course with an a progressive learning,4
"Great course , It has a lot of topics you can use in the future that will help you improve your company's performance.",4
"Thanks, I learn alot :)",4
Great foundational course for gaining familiarity with the concepts of online/digital marketing. A couple more practical applications (explained through a recent case study or interview with a practicing marketer) would take the course right up there to a 5-star rating.,4
A very decent primer for everyone new to programming or dusty on a different language.,4
Good basic course if you have no background in Finance. Reviews the important concepts that can get you along easily.,4
Excellent Professors the way the concepts were delivered was superb got the chance to learn alot.,4
"Really great, a little more specificity on the subjects (More time) would be even better.",4
"Good for beginners, introduced basic theory systemly. But a few mistakes appeared, though corrected in the videos too, but better to clear them in the future shifts.",4
"I would love to see more emphasis on the syntax of the language from where colons should be used to ""try"" then ""except"".",4
Fascinating course but a little too much math for my taste.,4
Very helpful.,4
"I learned a lot from this course, thank you.",4
It was really nice - I found the last week lectures most valuable.,4
"This course is quite interesting for people who want to understand the development of the biggest network in the world - the Internet, understand the basics of network-related technology, and security techniques for digital transaction. However, the review questions are fairly easy.",4
Very Interesting! I would extend the part on the biological passport and give more details on how the adaptive model algorithm works.,4
"A good course, content are a little bit too much in 4 weeks study. Exercises and assignment are easy.",4
"Chuck is a very interesting lecturer and the material is very good, although the course is a little bit too trivial.",4
"great course, I will recommend it.",4
Course is taught really well.Lots of space to practice before really going to the next concept.Request more solving sessions,4
"Very nice course, very interesting. I really liked the professor's specific sence of humour in examples he makes. The course was a little boring because of a lot talking about things already talked and understood, lots of specifications for people who might argue or disagree, or might feel offended.",4
Things got a bit hazy when it came to adding the .md file to our data science repo on GitHub. Other than that I enjoyed the course.,4
It's a great course however most of the assesment depend on peer grading,4
"Very nice course, it requires a bit of practical experience with the tools",4
A very clear discription to the basics of philosophy - I am happy that I have joined the course!,4
Instructor is engaging in her delivery. Topic is interesting but difficult.,4
"Great course! A little on the easy side for people who have seen ML before, but definitely offering many great insights and tools with which one can improve upon their models.",4
Very good course but more assignments should be included except the quizzes ....,4
Very informative,4
"Pretty interesting course, in which I gained a lot of knowledge about access web with Python.",4
Exceptional course with the content being simple and effective.,4
"Very good and clear overview of the diagnosis and characteristics of childhood autism and the assessment and choice of effective evidence-based treatment and education. There is very little about adults with autism, and there is no interaction facilitated between learners or between learners and educators.",4
The course gives great insight to Social and Social Media,4
"The instructor during the last week was in general not very good, he always strayed from the point making it difficult to keep up. He gave examples that are mostly irrelevant, and he was too theatrical and not straight to the point.",4
"I liked this course a lot because it has helped me to realise that I can plan my day better than I did, how to keep track of how I spend my time, to keep in mind productive vs unproductive work and much more.",4
"it was very helpful and interesting, I learned so much.",4
Great course and helpful especially for juniors,4
So far this was the most fun course of this specialization.,4
Pretty helpful . But 4 weeks is an awful lot of time for the content being taught in this course,4
A great course! Of course I will recommend it.,4
Very useful and practical,4
Nice course. I learnt so much but I am disappointed there's no certificate after all.,4
"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,...",4
"Very good overview and practical exercises to keep learners focus. Exercises can be very technical, get ready to spend more time on it.",4
"Chalenging exercices (I think a little too much), excelent readings, excelent presentation of R language.",4
I found this course really interesting and i got a lot of information that i will use in my daily work!,4
"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from ""Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling,"" for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",4
Awesome CourseNice way of Explaining thingsThanks Professor,4
Pretty nice,4
"This short course is targeted at working environment, where experience is enough. But for creative environment, or even learning scenario, the estimating techniques can be trivial. Procrastination is a bigger problem for students and workers in creative fields though.",4
Course is very light and very informative. Professor gives enough information for future study. Thank you for the hard work and simplifying those very complicated topics.,4
"If you are wanting to understand the Holocaust, this is an awesome, informative course.",4
Very useful course for beginners in cyber security,4
"Very good , but lack of mathmatical proof .",4
Good lecture for knowing Bootstrap!,4
I have learnt so much for doing this course. I have recommended the course to friends and families.,4
"interesting course with new insights which will change your perspectives on the evolution theory of dogs as well as general cognition. People exaggerated about the book comment, yes it is mentioned, but not ad nausium",4
Good course. A little demanding for someone who cannot invest substantial time figuring out how to code some problems.,4
Great course,4
Quite basic.,4
"Interesting. Good for beginners but some info is a little bit out of date. Overall, good course.",4
"Great Course! Thanks to all the staff, Stephen Mentor and especially to Dr-Chuck... I had fun and learned much. Could never imagine i could go this far in programming and all that for FREE. I'm very Grateful to y'all",4
Thanks a lot. I learned some solid stuffs that I mistakenly thought I'd known already. A real eye opener. Thanks a zillion.,4
"I found this very interesting, covering some topics I did not expect an introduction. I think the pace of the course is about right, but I would have liked more questions. Unfortunately I became very busy during the course and failed to keep up. I look forward to repeating it when I have more time.",4
It is nice course to learning ML,4
Very interesting and useful,4
"A really good introductory course for anyone interested in getting into Python. If you're experienced in coding, the beginning is a bit slow, but it picks up quickly by introducing Python specific features.",4
"The course is great, but I hope I can get to the final project. I have a little bit experience in python, so I skipped the first two courses of the specialisation project. But I still want to try the 5th one, which is locked to me now~",4
This course has really helped me in my understanding and appreciation of how research should be conducted.Thank You,4
"This course covers basic knowledge about Game Theory. But if you want to go deep on the topic, more efforts are needed beyond the course. It is good for beginners.",4
"I really enjoyed this course. Barbara Oakley was brilliant and explains things very clearly. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, however, was incredibly difficult to listen to. His speech didn't flow and that made it hard to follow what he was saying.",4
I found this course to be very informative. It is nicely paced and allows you to gain some insight into the whole issue of diet and health.,4
Great One Melbourne and BNY Mellon.,4
The information given is great so far. I would like to have some more questonnaire or summaries to further implement the learned content. Thank you for your services.,4
"I enjoyed this course very much and have NEVER had so much fun learning. The only thing driving me nuts was that I couldn't find anything in my notes or even on the web on one of the researchers mentioned in the final test. Dumping my grade. Hated that and would have wished you'd mention something so relevant in the summary in case someone had taken wrong notes or misunderstood during lectures.Otherwise: looking forward to working with you again!Thank you to the whole team.Feel free to connect or get in touch anytime. www.vegan-translator.comAll the best,Nicole",4
"Great class....l.loved it !!! Great class to learn about business, finance and money !!",4
"Course was great, learned so much! Audio levels on the videos was a tad quiet.",4
This course was in line with my expectations. Sometimes exercises were a bit out of context. I would have probably dedicated more time to Biopython.,4
Awesome opportunity to update your journalistic skills.,4
Practical insight to empower entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skil,4
Very useful,4
"Interesting course, I am a geo-information specialist and I took this Course to gain some understanding on epidemics so as to be of influence in mapping and modelling their spatial patterns. I have loved every bit of it especially the last part- Zombies!! I needed to hear more.",4
I loved the informations they're giving us and how the professor,4
"It was a good course, I wished more courses about Arduino and examples of what we can do with the platform in real life applications. Arduino seems more accessible that raspberry pi, in terms of price (I believe I cannot complete the course about this particular platform), the software (myself I have trouble with Linux, perhaps due to my low level of knowledge), in Arduino I used mostly the 123d simulator, which helped me a lot. I am grateful to Prof. Harris, the Coursera team and the California University.",4
its good introductory course into the Supply Chain Planning world.,4
Simple but informational.,4
It´s ideal for beginners. The teacher explain every thing very clear.,4
Good introduction to the concepts.,4
I've learn powerful information about how to learn! It was very empowering and helpfull,4
"GREAT, COMPREHENSIVE",4
Great but I strongly recommend you watch the videos on 1.5X speed as the prof talks a bit slowly,4
Very informative. Lots of new and novel concepts introduced.,4
too easy,4
Plus for practical tips. A bit too little focus on the mathematics. Minus for slightly buggy lecture videos.,4
"Videos are very good and the content was well explained. However, in my opinion, at the last couple of weeks the content felt a bit too fast and lacked depth.",4
"Great Course, maybe you could have the sildes for download so you can study them",4
Overall a good course,4
"I have been able to be comfortable with my camera by switching on to various pointers, changing ISO , gave me the clarity in understanding photography at the grass root level.",4
This is very good course for beginners and well explained wit practical example,4
Good Course.,4
Thanks!,4
As for me too much water. I'd like to have this course shorter and faster,4
Basics were taught but I wish it was more advanced to the point that I would feel comfortable doing data analysis in R on my own.,4
It's great to have access to the course even when you're not paying the certificate. Tip: make the presentations more attractive.,4
"I learned a lot from the teacher, and the guests gave useful insight into the industry",4
"A more challenging course, as to be expected in this stage of the specification. It would be interesting to know how much of the underlying code is working",4
"After having taken several Data Science-related courses, this course seems like a good introduction to Python for Data Science applications. Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data). You don't get the luxury of the common perfectly-prepared csv-files in this course, which is a good thing!",4
I have just started with the course and the introductory slides I found are perfectly designed. Thanks.,4
Feel the instructor is good but sometimes is difficult to follow his lectures.,4
I think it would be better if more real-word case studies are provided.,4
Good course stuff. A little bit too fundamental for a programmer.,4
"Good course, but too Russia-centric, especially the first two weeks (I prefer a more general approach). The course answers mainly the question ""how"" (how are money borrowed, how is IPO organized), but not ""why"" (why do described regulations exist, why are they the way they are, who is benefiting from that?).",4
It seems the teacher was under the influence of psychological drugs. He lacked the qualities of humans.,4
Good introductory course that gives you an overview to what you should know before starting other courses in the specialization. Some of the contents are a bit too obvious to someone with a previous background in IT.,4
Some practical time management tips. I found the parts on how to sort email and how to buffer crisis time especially useful.,4
"Not intended as comprehensive, but a very good starting point for understanding JS.",4
Good simple information and tools that will help you in starting the long course of time management.Good instructor elaborating with multiple examples.,4
This is more than just an Excel course. It also covers a lot of statistics and the application of statistics in Excel (with pre-built template). I think more focus on how to build things in Excel will be useful.,4
Touches on a lot of subjects. Each having its own complexity. I'd have loved of the concepts are covered in a little more depth.,4
"Great information, great teacher, greater visual presentation. Disclaimer: I only took the first week.",4
"The material OK, but some of the exercises and their interfaces are not well designed.",4
rich and engaging documentaries took 80% of the class content - but still fun to watch!,4
Very clear and to the point. Easy to follow and learn.It will be longer with more in-depth details about the different topics discussed!THANK YOU.,4
had a good learning experience,4
Its a good course those who prefer to study online.It gives a basic knowledge about the data tools which are going to be used.,4
It is a good course,4
"The course is very good and useful for teaching students how to better learn and understand the material they are dealing with. One drawback, however, is that it focuses excessively on test-taking and methods of succeeding in an undergraduate degree rather than a career. It would be nice and interesting to show how the techniques being presented can also be useful outside of class. not just by examples related to great people in various scientific fields, but also by more general parallels. Otherwise, it is a very good course to help combat anxiety and procrastination.",4
"I love this course. It's useful, and really interesting!Smithri Chopra is so kind and cute.",4
Its a good course for beginners and provides some good insights on how to change the thought,4
Thank you for giving me some concrete guidelines. I enjoyed following along without doing the assignments. Grateful to be able to be a part of the learning.,4
Great Course...Advise it for new people in project management world. Exercises could be better (putting scenarios or simulators...etc),4
Excellent in depth explanation of RDD and the API.Heather is super informative and the material is being passed in a practical and explanatory way.Hopefully there will be more courses like this one about Spark Streaming and Machine Learning.,4
Awesome course and the simplicity of demonstrating the concepts is quite good.,4
The course is well structured with clear objective for each lecture. It starts by asking the main question about the course then summarize the answer and the key messages.Practice and assignment are valuable to apply and test courses knowledge.Thank you,4
In general terms the course is very good. It would be great if they could include at least one real example of each statistic method presented.,4
"Overall, this course has very solid content. In fact, this is one of the few (probably the only one) advanced mathematics course on Coursera. More specifically, in order to take this course, you need to have good understanding of group, field and ring. In other words, you are assumed to have taken general undergraduate level abstract algebra courses before.However, there are some aspects of the course that are worth improving. First, probably due to the nature of online course, I personally find learning Galois Theory online very challenging. The lectures themselves make sense. The practice problems and quiz, however, sometimes do not seem to be reinforcing the lectures. The materials on tensor product seem to be unrelated as well. Usually these are covered in a course on commutative algebra. In addition, there was almost none communication within the discussion forums.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course if you have good background in general abstract algebra. After all, Galois Theory has long been a capstone type of course. If you have some background but not solid, it is definitely still doable.",4
Really liking it though am still in week one :),4
"Course materials are a little bit obvious, but I really like the original version of The Shooter and Jane's personality",4
More information should be given for the failed test cases. Is a waste of time to find bug if you don't know what the bug is. ie test case 4/13 in the minimal dot product assignment,4
This was a very interesting course. It presented a new way of looking at emotions I had not thought of before and the lectures were fun and interesting. The quizzes could have been a bit more challenging. Excellent forum participation from the mentors/staff.,4
was fun and engaging,4
"The teachers are really good and the information given is helpful. However the lessons are a little short, they could go deeper in the topics.",4
"Though not too inclusive, it's a great course for introduction.",4
Good one . Expected more exercise or assignment .,4
"This was a good introductory course into clinical trials, providing an overview of its principles, features and design. The lectures were good and clear, and the accompanying slides were just as useful. I will admit to being occasionally lost on certain concepts, especially with regards to those which would've normally been covered in the biostatistics class, as Ms. Drye mentioned once or twice -- after all, I believe this is a class which is probably offered in conjunction with others. That notwithstanding, I can now consider myself aptly familiar with clinical trials and what they entail, thanks to this course.I will say, however, that having just 10 questions in the quiz is hardly neither exhaustive nor -- and I suppose this goes without saying -- a true test of a good grasp of the course. For instance, I'd read most of the supplemental material for Ethics (week 4) only to realize that that week's quiz could've been passed using common sense alone. I felt somewhat disappointed by that. And also, while one lecturer was very clear in her presentation and discourse, the other wasn't really; more often than not, I was confused by her sentences.",4
"The course is great, but more practices would be better. In addition, the exams are too detailed to test one's ability.",4
Great course on understanding and managing time.,4
Material was well presented. Exercises could have been more involved; likely would have enhanced the learning.,4
"This course is a sort of sequel to ""Introduction to Game Design"", by providing a deeper learning about the usage of the Unity Engine for Game Development. In the course, the student will develop a game mostly from scratch, using the assets provided by the teachers. There is a stronger focus on coding this time, as well as, a demand for the development of new and original concepts at the end of it.",4
Several good and useful study methods and techniques were discussed. At times I felt that unrelated and digressing topics were covered,4
Enjoyed this module right. I felt it was quite fast and just skimmed over certain topics but I definitely learnt more than I did and looking forward to learning in more details.,4
Good basic knowledge but I felt that I already knew most of it. Still very well put together and definetly recommend it to high school or university students.,4
"All the courses in this specialization are great, but compared to the other 3 i did until now, this one seemed a bit short on material. Especially week 1, and somewhat week 6 was without good material. Weeks 2, 3 and 4 were great. I got lost somewhere in week 5 on collapsed Gibbs sampling.Still: very much recommend this course, it provides a good introduction to Nearest Neighors, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures and LDA. Thx prof. Fox!!",4
"A great lectures, I really like the attitude of this professor. He is really into his subject and I appreciated his resolution, when it comes to reducing the legacy of his favorite sociologists, into just one crucial point.Not five stars for quizzes, the parts concerning reading of classics could be much more motivating, in the aspect of the actual reading and anderstanding.Wish the course from University of Amsterdam on modern authors to come sooner.",4
Very good material with more than enough detailing on the subject. Wish it could have more practical examples and exercises.,4
Good practical and technical information... Applicable skills for making time spent studying easier and more effective.,4
"Good course, clear and easy to understand some exercises were outdated as red laser doesn't exist any more",4
"I did not know before that finding applying and interviewing is like a science thing that I have to study and educate myself for, I found that the course is very good and standardise the whole idea",4
"Great course, but a bit short.",4
"Great intro to Python with great lectures , quizzes and assignments.",4
Insightful and reflective material; great facilitators.The sessions were a little less engaging in between because the facilitators didn't talk to/engage the user but were talking between them.,4
Great stuff.,4
Its pretty decent. I liked the assignments. However there were some typos in the lecture slides and also the grader output is not very friendly.,4
Thank you for this great introductory to Mindfulness and Meditation! Time to take it off the cushion and into the world!,4
A good introduction to the Organic Solar Cells world.,4
"The full course should be available to everybody with the assignments, only the certificate should be given to those who have paid for the course.",4
"This course is pretty fun. Also, despite the perhaps childlike impression one gets of the programming language Scratch, it still resembles other languages in logic and in prinsiple. Towards the end of the course, we saw the same few lines of code in Scratch and Python, and it showed their similarity.",4
"Very useful information for interviews, especially if you're not familiar with the process used for interviewing software development candidates.",4
"Starts off really basic, but is thorough. Overall, very informative.",4
"Very enthusiastic lecturer, which made learning that much more enjoyable! The course content is fantastic. My only comment is the grading system for the assignments / how the assignments are designed - in my opinion the grading system could be improved to reflect efforts and correct submission done by students.",4
An excellent course. There were surprising insights in almost every class. I also enjoyed the practical mindset displayed by the staff and course materials.,4
"Nice and tough course. Make sure to plan ahead for the homework if you expect to complete all of the assignments above and beyond what is required. After finishing the course I switched my session to the next one so that I would be able to complete all the extra assignments. It can be tough juggling this class if you work full time, and have other projects outside of work that demand your time.",4
A useful elementary course.,4
More code and result demonstration would be better for understanding.,4
Very good online course,4
"Excellent course overall. I very much like Dr. Charles Severence's explanations of the material. He's very methodical and keeps the material interesting.The only gripe that I have is the auto-grader for the code. It is fickle and gives odd errors sometimes, causing a student to dedicate undue time.",4
"This course is an easy, entertaining, and beneficial course. It is encourages you to enhance your creativity in everyday lives. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would've preferred to include more theoretical knowledge in addition to the practical.",4
Great Course,4
"I like that the course material is divided up such that someone who is busy with a day job can also find time to listen to the lectures and do the quizzes. Also like that the course gets you familiar with the way the financial market is organized and helps one get familiar with the terms. However, I personally felt there was insufficient coverage on the math and many of the quiz questions were not at all easy to understand the terms and apply the formulas. There need to be more examples of such problems so that there is more familiarity with the math especially for those completely new to this field.",4
"Short but powerful course, the most important thing is YOU, start today and change your habits, be focus and discipline!",4
A nice starting for those wanted to understand data science.,4
Great course!,4
nice course to get kick start for working in python,4
I was enjoy this course ¡¡,4
"work motivational, very clear, well structured on a steady groove ... excellent!",4
lectures do not correspond to the laboratory work,4
it is very niice,4
"It was amazing, It contained the basics of a very wide area of knowledge",4
"I truly enjoyed the lectures and the material and I hope it will help me whilst trying to learn new things, subjects, more deeply in the future.I found the tests a bit too easy though - patterns can be recognised, helping us with the answer -- creating the illusion of competence :)I want to learn more and more deeply on this subject and some aspects of it - memory and so on, from a scientific perspective -- maybe the course could dig deeper, or I might just look for more info elsewhere.Thank you to both Professors and the team of people involved.",4
Really good material. Lectures are fun to watch and easy to follow.,4
"A very helpful course, it acts as a perfect accompaniment to the existing knowledge of any health professional.",4
"very interesting, good lectures,",4
"Very good course leading to insightful consideration for new managers. Quickly applicable with the Thought Model exercise. Would highly recommend. I give it 4 starts out of 5 because some improvement needed around expected deadlines on week 3, and for a few technical bugs: one must be logged into a browser to participate in the discussion forum - I couldn't make it work from my iPad or iPhone apps.",4
Very good introduction to a more healthy life style.,4
"Pace and content of the course is just nice. However, it would be good if more lecture slides were provided.",4
Good beginners and introductory course to Arduino and C. Prof. Harris is a brilliant lecturer.,4
"Basic course for budding writers.Good practice.Also, excellent interviews with other published writers, editors and playwrights. It was the highlight of the course for me.",4
Good course,4
good overview of how to make graphs!,4
"Very informative and engaging. Stephen's attitude makes you want to go and make recordings right away, it's a pity you can't take quizzes without paying though.",4
latex is better :O,4
Very well explained.,4
I enjoyed doing this course. It lays out the basics in such a structured way that is easy to understand and apply even if a person has no background in marketing. It is a great foundation course.,4
As someone with only (UK) high school level maths I just about managed to follow this. I am still confused by logarithms. I guess I should go and read the maths for computer science resource.,4
"Programming assignment is not fully covered in the lectures, prefer to have subject metter completely covered instead of searching for everything online.",4
Excellent! Very good!,4
A useful course that gives practical guidelines on increasing physical activity in daily life. It specifies that even as low as 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise 5 times a day can be very beneficial to an otherwise sedentary person.,4
"Content is very interesting, nice introduction to Big Data.Slides can be improved though.",4
Pretty decent course for learning R basics,4
"I was hoping to learn about PROBIT models. I know they are very similar to LOGIT ones, but still... the pace is a little bit too fast and I think it requires more time than what it says.",4
A good first,4
It was an useful course. I believe that I will use the tools learned in this course.,4
It's an interesting course. I have learned and exploded many helpful things during study this course.Thanks so much for you all contribution.,4
Gorgeous,4
Loving it so far,4
A very good course but it was a little narrow because it focused on the professor's own research. Perhaps one or two lectures on other trends ad research results from the wider field of positive psychology would be apt.,4
i learned some valuable skills during this course. it was useful for reflection - remembering to look after yourself as well as others is very important. i will definitely be able to use the information and skills along with my medical training in my daily working life. thanks.,4
"The course goes direct to the point, it's very objective. The only disadvantage is the Italian accent of the professors, sometimes it's boring to listen. I reccomend this course to students or for people outside the fashion world.",4
"The narration and content are excellent. The clarity of the slides has given neat direction steps to installing the software. However, I was not able to co relate the Command Line Interface with the R console after installation. I was overwhelmed with the huge list of commands immediately after software installation. The Week 3 videos have great information but lacks a coherence with the remaining course content.",4
"This good course; but I have none of those cards, as I can do to pay the course",4
"Thank you for these lessons, answered my pressing questions about web development",4
"Great, in-depth on topic.",4
"The starting point for anyone who wants to learn machine learning , but need to continue immediately with a specialised courses on R, SAS or Python. Otherwise whatever learn in the course will disappear",4
"The course was a very comprehensive introduction to Buddhist Meditation:- there were lectures about the different Buddhist meditation traditions- practical trainings on Buddhist meditation- neurological and psychological view on the effects of meditation on the human bodyand many more topics related to meditation.I found the course was actually overloaded with content: most videos were too long and there were too many videos. Some videos were more like reading a text: the lecturer was most likely reading his own script from a Teleprompter instead of really talking to the audience. The videos were not bad, but I see some room for improvement for most videos of most lecturers. My favourite videos were from Anam Thubten, he was most genuine and convincing to me.All in all it was still an excellent introduction into the topic for me: a big thank you to all people involved, you did a great job!!",4
"It is a really nice course if you plan to complete all the 10 courses in the Data Science Specialization track. As a standalone, It is not that great a course as it basically introduces you to different things and you need to do other courses to actually learn something.",4
"A good continuation of Think Again I. However, final quiz had lots of bugs in it.",4
This is a Great Course. However I think that is a wonderful option to have an intermediate leve with angularJs.,4
This class is practical and it can be the first class in M.L.,4
Great course.,4
coursera的盈利项目，必须交钱才能take quiz and assignment。不过swirl还是很不错的。,4
"Brief but great course! Offers the basic fundamentals for Personal Finance, Taxes, Insurance, and finishes up with the structure of the MBA program. While this is definitely a 100 level introduction, it is presented and laid out well. Going a little deeper into the subject matter would have earned this course a full 5-stars.",4
"It very useful for me, i can link presentation with myself.",4
"great one,",4
"I love the course, even I am not a mother, but soon I will be, so I think this course really helpful. It gives me knowledge about how to give food to your family especially children. Start from choosing the ingredients up to cook it in a proper way.Thank You",4
Fast paced and hands on. Totally awesome!,4
"Very interesting for beginners. Is very hands on focus, not much theory and is focus on the most used commands, leaving the deep knowledge for other courses.",4
"It is just turning out to be a tremendous experience. Robert Schiller, or Bob Schole (as carl Icaahn calls him) is one heck of a personality! the man holds a sea of depth knowledge and history in him. I'm barely half way through the course but it is just unbelievably informative, and has the right balance of knowledge, explanation, my favorite thing psychology, and the guest speaker every week is the cherry on top!",4
Give clear understanding about virtual teaching.,4
It is a great course. It teches you how your brain works so you can take advantage to learn better. It would be a lot better if it includes exercises on how to improve each aspect of ours brain.,4
"This course helped me a lot to better understand the financial markets , and the different assets in which we can invest. The presentation was simple and clear in most of the modules. Maybe more examples and detailed description needed in company evaluation especially for students with moderate mathematical background. The module of Bonds needs -in my opinion - reconstruction so that we can read and understand the changes in Bonds' prices we find in the economical websites and newspapers. Anyway, the course is motivating to know more & extend our knowledge. Thanks a lot to all the professors and lecturers who prepared that course. Special thanks to Dr. Michelle and Dr. Ines for their attractive and simple approach. I recommend this course to all interested in investment management either for themselves or for professional purposes.",4
Ideal also for those who have no experience with programing.,4
"The course is good and very informative. However, the quiz at the end can be made a bit more interactive and opinionated.",4
Really enjoyed the content of this course,4
"A bit short, did help with structuring the UX process but I feel it was very very basic so probably more suitable to people that just start their journey in UXland",4
Need to include challenge faced by Developing countries,4
"Design thinking is for everyone, the problem is people haven't realized. Until we have a number of people who understand and are ready to follow design thinking processes, it would be waste of a great concept. We all need to use DT in our everyday lives.",4
"Learned Spark APIs, internals.",4
An Introduction needed.,4
Nice course for a preliminary understanding of Game Theory! Highly recommended!!!,4
Nice Course with Nice Tasks.,4
"Well explained, simple brief lectures to understand and yet to detail.Rasul Shaban",4
great course for a beginner,4
"I enjoyed studying the lessons and making the assignments. I don't feel comfortable with the idea of reviewing other student's tasks/projects or vice-versa since I'm not a fluent English language speaker, but I know this is the way to get grades on Coursera.I suggest updating some lessons since this course was released on 2014 and some things have changed since that year in the digital marketing field.",4
Really useful and fantastic course. But the tutor's words are so fast and the course's content is a little hard to understand. Maybe give us more time will be better.,4
I sincerely appreciate the enormous effort and encouragement of Prof. Daniel M. Ogilvie and Prof. Leonard W. Hamilton. A sincere hug and my gratitude.,4
Great course!! It's really useful.,4
"Very good introduction. It is a very basic, but much needed step. Setting up the tools you will need.",4
A general brief about how you can make calculated and broad assumptions on the tock market. Not a specialized course but is helpful in getting the basics.,4
Very nice explanations!,4
very emotional,4
A bit too simple for my liking. And too many repeated content. But overall a good course for an absolute beginner.,4
"the last peer review problem is much too hard for what I learned from the course material, if there is a more specific instruction for the assignment will be better.",4
Excellent course. My only criticism was that there was perhaps a little too much hand-holding in the assignments. Still learned a ton! Thank you!,4
The content of this course was great. The videos were a little odd at first (could be a cultural thing) and a portion of the content was obviosly scripted and felt a little more robotic but I got used to that pretty quickly. The information aligned with previous study but also brought a lot of new techniques and information.,4
"Course is greate, really! But one thing was not as good, as I want - teachers pronunciation. Other things were great! Thanks!",4
"Thank you! I enjoyed the content and learning more about happiness. I found the music a wee bit corny, though.",4
"This course will give you a good basic foundation in regression models. However, do be prepared to do a good amount of work besides just viewing the videos. I would recommend at the very least to go through the exercises in the 'recommended textbook' to gain a better understanding.",4
"It's about 4.4 actually. Not enough to give 5 though.First about positive sides. I think course is well structured (except for a few minor drawbacks), quizzes fit to the material. An assignments truly buck up the material. And I think material give a grounding in future Android Development.But I think it can be problem with the learning process, mostly with programming assignment. I think it's common that when course come out for the first time it's almost inevitably that there are some issues with autograder. It' s just common. But these issue are usually easy to spot, because the output of autograder contains test cases. So one can easily find out what the problem is, if it's with autograder. As for this course, the autograder output is very minimalistic, and if the problem is with autograder it's rather hard to spot. I myself spent entire evening, trying to find what is wrong with my code, and it was pure luck that I finely spotted the problem (and, yes, it was autograder issue). Such thing could be very frustrating, really.Another problem with programming assignments is about Peer Review. The students actually get access to assessment criteria, after they have submitted they code. And their code not necessary fit these criteria. I think it could spoil the learning process as well.I actually aware that these drawbacks can be corrected in release course, and if they will be, I will be glad to change the rating.",4
"This course creates a solid bridge between the basics you learned and the advanced concepts you're going to learn in Python. Even if you have prior python experience, this course will be good refresher of your knowledge on Python. Thanks Dr.Chuck and Coursera.",4
I learned quite a lot and the course work was easy to follow and build knowledge from lesson to lesson. I enjoyed the projects as well.,4
Very clear information and good exercises to practice.,4
Full of great information on how to balance work time.,4
Nice course. Thanks.,4
"In this course, Randy Hlavac does a deeper dive into the importance of social media monitoring and gives a nice overview of some key social listening tools available on the market today.",4
Very good course with basic but extremely important concepts.,4
This course could have been better if the TA's were a bit more active.,4
Very good overview of ML for beginners.Each technique is very detailed and presented from intuition to pratice,4
This course was great for developing new brain connections. It was sometimes frustrating - In particular with the very limited discussion threads available on the forum (I wonder if it would be possible to merge forum threads between some runs...). But it was great introduction to get the brain started with functional programming and related Scala syntax.,4
"It was a great course. In the first to weeks the concepts were not so clear, but after this, the lessons became more clear and everything fit. It gave me really good insights. I look forward for social norms, social change II. Hope it come soon.",4
This course provides clear and crisp additions/modifications in our daily life style that can bring about significant changes. Instructor illustrates these solutions by means of very simple yet powerful examples and provides useful monitoring techniques that'll one help become more productive. All in all this is a good course one must take to learn or if you already know then refresh the ideas to become more productive.,4
"Very enjoyable course! However, I think that it would have been nice to have some more professional viewing of our work, since several of us were taking in this information for the first time.",4
"Extremely good overview of a large variety of Machine Learning Algorithms!The only thing that bothered me a little was that everything was done in MATLAB instead of R or Python, which is probably more natural for most people taking the course. Also, this course is rather directed at people with a programming background that want to get into stats, not so much for people with a stats background that want to get into the programming part of ML (which I was).",4
"The course material is great and its an awesome starting point for data analysis. However, its very unfortunate that the assignments are in Matlab / Octave. It's very important to study Python for interviews, as that is the most popular language with excellent data science tools. Also, the Octave environment is not the most stable and I often encountered problems. I wish Professor Andrew Ng had taken industry needs and data science needs into consideration while selecting the platform.",4
Good introduction into Meteor. The Pace is good and the instruction is engaging. The last assignment can be a bit tricky for the challenges.,4
great study materials and presentation.,4
It's a good course and it has a great structure !,4
"I enjoyed the course - I wish there were more exercises, but hopefully they'll come in the next courses of this specialization.",4
Very good training material and great teaching method used by Mr. Andrew Ng. It could be improved by having review question based on using Ocatave / Matlab scripting to make the learning more interactive and interesting.,4
first mooc for me - it got me to the end with pleasure. And I think it motivated me to continue learning and try those presented concepts or continue using them when I was allready using them before.,4
Very good course with good assignment questions.,4
Basic/beginner python syntax and coding elements. FYI: More work needs to be done to become proficient.,4
"The Good> A lot of content> Provided a lot of outside reading material> Passionate professor> A lot of good refreshers (about CVs, teamwork, business practices)Suggestions> I hope in the future more time could be spent on monetization theories and practices> More emphasis on mobile games (as much as I dislike them)> Maybe some type of ""case study"" examples about games from conceptualization to publishing",4
"Very hands on oriented, great addition to more mathematically focused lectures.",4
"This course is really not easy to who is not in the domain of computer science. Even the computer science people, it's also not quite easy to familiar with that statistic program, e.g. R Programming. If having more ""trace program"" training, I'd be better for that students who I mention above.However, anyway, I very much enjoyed this course to know how to program to analysis a data set.Thank you very much.",4
"Strong, fluid, insightfull and passionate course!",4
"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.",4
Tougher than the first in the specialization. You have to spend time on the material to succeed. In the end a lot of the concepts were not that difficult to figure out - don't overthink things as well!,4
¡ Muy buen curso ! ¡ Tks !,4
Precise teaching. Informative.,4
"I like the course but currently it has some issues. First and foremost problem is tests. There are some questions that allow ambiguous interpretation, some questions require to know the information that is discussed later in course and so on. Also the lectures are quite short. Other than that course gives very nice introduction into using the spreadsheets in modelling",4
Never thought I would be interested in philosophy - that was the start of my adventure.,4
"There is no initial syntax explanation, most exercises are done by copy and paste. That's good for experienced developers but difficult for beginners.",4
This is a very interested course I really recommend.,4
"Lectures and content were great. The theme of the course is to provide insight into the approaches used to investigate approximation algorithms for NP hard problems and the theoretical techniques used to assess the effectiveness of the approximation algorithm against the best answer. The production quality of the lecture videos and slides was high.The content of the quizzes and assignments was mostly appropriate and well organized. However, the authors appeared to struggle with the platform. At times there were comments such as, you need to enter something in the box but it was not actually being used. Answers to the assignments required using substantial mathematical notation, but LaTex was not enabled in the discussion or text entry boxes (no longer available in the Coursera platform??) so the work around was to upload answers to a bunch of questions as a single PDF document. Flow of the individual modules (lectures, slides, quizzes) was inconsistent, varying from week to week.",4
Good course! Thanks!,4
"Goes over the fundamental basics of programming quite well.One area for improvement would be more exercises and assignments. Students at this stage in beginning programming could always use more smaller exercises to solidify knowledge. Although it would seem pointless to experienced programmers coming from other languages, I think it would benefit beginners.",4
"Very clear and organized, I will certainly make use of what I learned when writing programs or designing software.",4
Very well explained!! This course and specialization are really good!,4
Good course with basic concepts.,4
It's a very useful for all beginners and intermediate professionals.Keeping Learning! Good luck to all.,4
I have loved this course as Respected Gerry Landers explains everything considering various aspects. I have surely improved on being a professional email writer. Most important attribute of this course is that it has really helpful links in the ADDITIONAL RESOURCES section after each lesson.Thank you Professor Gerry Landers and Coursera!,4
Easy to understand. Homework is somewhat challenging and the contents are very useful for novice.,4
Really good course and concepts! Thanks for all the information given. I'm sure I am going to take a lot of the techniques and learning into my professional life and study options.,4
"Very useful to improve business skills, well structured and practical.",4
"I learned some new things because I'm a total beginner,I think the contents are updated but not very structured,the hands-on part is just a small peek of the whole big data process system and not very useful.It's not a complete course if you don't take the later courses of the whole specialization.So I gave 4 stars for this introduction course.",4
It was a nice course which helps you understand basic concepts. was expecting more peer graded assignments.,4
Very informative and the course begins with very basic stuff,4
I think this is a great course for understanding the basics in programming.,4
"Good course, learned a lot especially through the quizzes and the course project, but slides/presentations could be more engaging.",4
Needs more than 4 weeks worth of material. Assignments and quizzes should be free.,4
Good course. Especially enjoyed the crowdsourcing lectures.,4
I think we should provide more time for the folks to make their project and put up the video. Else it is a great one.,4
Great set of materials. Great introduction on data analytics,4
Way too technical for a beginner...,4
It Has a lot of useful info but you can get bored quickly so you must love MS and stick with it,4
"very important for both new designer, who want to enrich their knowledge, and experienced designers, as a refresher.",4
"This is an excellent course for a complete newcomer to programming and the professor has taken great care to address the newcomers. However, I would advise anybody with any programming experience to not take the course. If you have a non python programming background and are learning python, then you can quickly learn some syntax, do all the assignments and clear the course.",4
"Very informative, easy to understand and gives a clear understanding about the overall concept on usable security.",4
Very interesting and thoughtful stuff!,4
its a excellent teaching awsome faculty.,4
"Great Class, Creative ideas to help student to be successful.",4
a nice course to learn the basics of python and raspberry pi programming!!,4
"I liked all the content though I thought presentation of it was a bit boring, a lot of the what not to do examples were a bit obvious or extreme rather than attempting to shed light on the subtle mistakes one might be inclined to do. Some of the quiz questions seemed almost purposefully confusing or worded in a trick way, which felt a little pointless. Otherwise I've enjoyed everything I've learned and would definitely take another PFA course, maybe a level 2 or something.",4
This has some good history in it. But short for sure.,4
"Shame that some interesting parts have been cut out of the lectures, but a very good overview and insight in financial markets",4
Very didatic approach to machine learning. Easy access and still powerful technique to understand how it works.,4
"The course is pretty well structured and the exercises were explained pretty well. It was pretty easy to follow the steps and do the assignments, but sometimes required a little bit more explanation on what does what, and why sometimes even after following his steps, our website might not look similar to what he has done on the exercise. One thing also if possible I'm not sure if carousel is pronounced ka-ruu-sel in Hong Kong, but it's Char-uh-sel like the ride, which to me was quite annoying to listen to.",4
Few example code are not well explained.But the whole course is proper for beginners learning web development !,4
"Really intresting! I learnt a lot and now I have the opportunity to understand more things about recruiting, hiring and onboarding ! Thank you very much",4
I enjoyed the course. It gave a good historical look at the foundations of religion. I'm looking forward to Unit 2.,4
"The professor is passionate and makes learning calculus as easy as possible. Plenty of videos and explanations, but not many realistic problems given.",4
Really nice teacher!I could got the point eazliy but the v,4
simply awesome!!,4
The tests are a little too easy.,4
Course is good and they are working hard on having advisors available.,4
"Good science, great explanations, simple recipes with tips and advice. Strongly recommended to people with little/no cooking and/or science backgrounds - especially new university students and parents. However, I would not consider the professor (she is a doctor though) a skilled chef - while her recipes are great and simple, the techniques she uses are perhaps not the best, given that she is conducting a course that's nearly 20% cooking demonstrations. I would strongly suggest consulting a Jamie Oliver book/video, or Michael Smith to augment this course.TL'DR: Great science and explanations, good recipes, could have used better cooking techniques. Good for uni students/healthy eaters.",4
Informative.. Lacks interaction...,4
A quiz or project question on k-means clustering or PCA would be nice. Overall the course provided solid coverage of the three main plotting systems in R.,4
"very informative in general framework of data analysis, very helpful!",4
Some of the lectures were a little dull but the information was fantastic!,4
"Good content. MIght want to change up the presentations for variety - add visual aids, etc.",4
"It was a good exercise, but there were some inconsistencies between the assignment rubric that was published and the grading key the students use to evaluate your work. More alignment between these two would be helpful.",4
"Need more information in videos, but course is very nice - especially I liked submissions",4
Very good course!,4
Some very useful points. Would recommend to anyone who struggles in understanding punctuation.,4
"way to beginner, felt it could've gone a bit more in depth coming from a known university such as Duke.",4
"I really enjoyed this course a lot. However i am not familiar with Math, i could pass this course with 92.8% and for me this high grade.Thanks a lot for Tokyo University and Prof.Maruyama who exerted a great effort in this course , and Also i wanna thank Coursera Team too, because made this course available to students who live in arid countries.Ahmed Osama Abdelnaeem.",4
"The lectures were too heavy on Industry experts who quickly covered the important topics. I have taken many technology and business courses on Coursera with one or two professors covering the important content accented with industry and subject matter expert interviews. This format works best for consistency and learning, IMHO.. A student who is not in the Cybersecurity field will not gain insight into the meat of the material from the lectures. The final exam question material is almost exclusively absent in the lectures. One is required to read the cited material to gain the required information",4
It would be grate if they can offer a course about explanation of more English grammar and Tenses (especially Perfect Tense),4
Korean language is so difficult,4
I love the idea of a sociological view of war.,4
"I really enjoyed this course and I liked the variety of videos as well as ""special lessons"" with professionals from different fields.The exercises supported studies and gave better understanding of the tools.However, I believe some of the lessons (or videos) were a bit off from topic or gave too much focus on the issues that, I believe, are not that much related to the course purpose. (e.g. too much of 3D printing).Overall, it is a great course and I was pleased to participate in it!",4
Good course for beginners. Lacks sufficient exercises.,4
"Overall, this course was a great introduction to the basic web programming languages for someone with little to no experience. My only issue was that the assignments could have been more challenging, and one in particular was not put together properly by the instructors (missing information to complete assignment) this has since been fixed.",4
Good intro,4
"Information was very useful, but some of the content was difficult to understand due to the heavy accents.",4
Excellent material and explained well by the professor!,4
"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Could improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!",4
"This is a great course. Teachers are full of energy and desire to teach, examples are easy to follow (not so much at the end) but it is a great course where you will learn a lot. Highly recommended.",4
"Quite an interesting course connecting various fields such as mathematics, physics, brain science, music and music theory. I am giving it 4 stars as I feel that some explanations are weak and need more elaboration.",4
Material is what I was looking for to model decision making in a business/project setting. More practice would have been useful and extra material such as e-books or articles.,4
the professor is cute!!,4
It was awonderfull learning jeorney,4
It was an interesting course and even if theoretically one is supposed to know and realize what is presented here it is good to have it told again for refreshing memory and reinforcement.,4
It was a nice course although I'd have appreciated more if it could have been more in depth with CSS...,4
The course is extremely good. It would be still better if there is inclusion of basics to create a UI.,4
Very good. Could include more examples of making smart.,4
"Many practical examples for usages of machine learning.Almost concepts, no hard math works.Recommend for beginners who interested in machine learning but did not have any math background.",4
It was great!,4
"The lecturer is very engaging and for the most part these lectures were valuable. A few of them bordered on ""why are we talking about this?"" though. Felt more like filler than actual value. I think this could have been condensed to three weeks without losing much.",4
This was a tough class covering a lot of material. The last week on logistic regression completely lost me. If you're new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once.,4
"Thorough explanation, good pace for people that need time to take in the information.",4
This is a great overview of Design Thinking and how it applies to any business.I would highly recommend that participants read any of the books published by Professor Liedtka as it provides many interesting examples which reinforce the concepts discussed in class.,4
The course contents and arrangement of topics are easy to understand.,4
"An entremely good effort, gives you a wonderful introduction to the wonderful world of Survey Research in general and data collection overall. One of the plus point is that it directs you towards quite a few new sources of data that is pretty interesting if you are an active researcher.",4
The course is very detailed and I like the way the instructors explain the material in an in depth way. I am learning a lot.,4
Love this course,4
this a great cour!,4
It is very interesting but the data collection and preparations in every example is not clear. please work on it.,4
"what a course, elaborative and to the point",4
There were times I got lost on the explanations.However it is a great manner to begin,4
Great Course but the assigment don't show the understanding of the course,4
Great starting point for software design.,4
"Fantastic course, comprehensive and easy to follow. A good introduction to the field.",4
Excellent teaching and material,4
Very informative. A lot of different experts. Nice and sometimes funny animations,4
Good Course,4
Its a good overview. I am looking into health informatics for a possible masters course. I learnt a lot. I wish there were more practical examples of how informatics improves healthcare delivery,4
A great introduction to the intriguing world of Human microbiome.,4
Is a very good course with different examples from different locations worldwide.,4
"The accent from teachers would be a little bit annoying, also the fact that most of the topics (incomes, outcomes from the programs) are unclear for a naive student. But for the rest, is a great way to introduce programming.",4
I think everyone should take this course although some of the lectures are hard,4
Homeworks are more complicated compared to the class examples.,4
"Very good course. However, you need to do a lot of reading. The videos are simply introductions to the topics. The course has a lot of reading. The readings are great resources, however, some of them are very very long. I wish the videos had more of a lecture component. The final was difficult as you had no idea what would and what would not be on it. Great information, in-depth course, but it could have more video/lecture resources. It could also have more information concerning the information on the final exam.",4
"This course is very complete in terms of vocabulary and helpful for people who haven't been in a hospital or clinic before to get and idea of how these settings work. The only thing I would have wished for this course to have a little more vocabulary is on diseases, conditions and procedures.",4
"A little basic, but necessary to get everything you need set up for the next classes in the series. And it does that well enough.",4
well structured. should be more focused on practical applications. the final exam could be more hands on on cases than on definitions.,4
Very intelligent approach of incentivating the creativity. Maybe the videos shall give even more activities to do. But it is a very interesting course.,4
"I'M LEARNING,ENJOYING THIS COURSE.LECTURE IS SO GOOD.ASSIGNMENTS ARE EAST AND CHALLENGING.",4
i came to more about china this is useful for me to do international business thank you !,4
Good introduction.,4
"Extremely well done videos, Professor Sachs is articulate and clear. The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment.The quiz are not easy, one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5. However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it's a good learning process. It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long!",4
very good overview of the fundamental concepts of Java,4
Tough to pass. Great scientific info. Instructor born to teach.,4
Great and effective,4
World class teacher. Fine contents with a very useful legal approach that is often missed in introductory negotiation courses.Compared to other Coursera MOOCs I missed support materials or further readings. Additional assignments and cases could be included.,4
"tough, but well worth it !",4
"Very instructive course, in a totally pleasant way. It is not a strict one to follow, has a lot of interesting material in various aspects and different views of the issue. And totally pleasant instructor to watch :) It made me think about a lot, both regarding learning as a procedure, as well as about me as a learner. Thank you!",4
"I give this 4 out of 5 stars mostly due to some technical video/audio issues with the material and its presentation and editing. Also, there didn't seem to be anyone moderating and only a few other people taking the class so not enough forum discussions to help us out. Additionally, I'm also disappointed there isn't a part II that continues into ML approaches to the subject. Finally, I think a bit more rigor and theory could be introduced into the videos before just pointing to the accompanying textbooks. But I understand the tradeoffs. Looking forward to part II (please Dr. Balch!)",4
Simple and practical guidelines which can be followed easily. I think I will be able to apply the methods discussed in the course on daily basis without actually spending much time on learning them as they are very practical! The course has been useful in making me realize where all my time has been going without quantifiable results and hopefully I will be able to make a habit of good time management. Thank you for putting it together :-),4
"I really like it!!!From easiest to hardest content, I´ve learn three programatio languages priciples",4
Nice Course to be introduced in R programming very well explained.,4
"I enjoyed the course and believe I learned something of value. I will say, however, that this is not a general course on Positive Psychology, but rather a focus on the professor's research on love and emotions in the field of Positive Psychology.",4
"Through this course, I was able to learn the basics of Journalism and apply it in my job as well. The professors explain everything clearly with good examples. The course is easy and understandable. Thank you all for a great course!",4
good course I like it and the way it was given.,4
Dr. Chuck is exceptionally talented. The entire course was very engaging and a fruitful learning experience. Definitely would recommend this course for beginners.,4
Excellent Course but i was expecting some more content !! its very good,4
"I enjoyed the writeups as their explained system modelling very well. The first two assignments are a bit lacking in terms of what they teach, I believe one should instead handle the generation of the quad rotor system model and the other should teach control with the final teaching traj generation.",4
There was not as much coding as prior courses but students can learn the knowledge of database.,4
"Solid contents, also required solid graduate level mathematics. The instructor may consider providing more details in some of the derivations. It is a bit difficult to follow during some lectures.",4
"The audio volume throughout the videos should be improved; consistently, my ears were bombarded during the first shot(s), but as soon as the side-shot plus code came into view I had to crank up the volume in order to understand what was said.Otherwise, it was a very well thought-out and enjoyable class, thanks!",4
Very useful course for newcomers to nutrition!,4
Inroduced useful tools to deal with decision making,4
"Excellent Course! It taught me that I can take good things from the ""bad"" methodologies from the past.",4
Such a nice course. Very good for an introductory course,4
"A great introduction to many important concepts in the field.Not going deep enough into the assumptions of these concepts, why they are the dominant concepts, and what other alternative frameworks/perspectives there are. Too business-school like.",4
"Ideal for Highschool students/graduates who want to pursue further higher educational engineering subjects. A little bit challenging, yet entertaining, and worthy of participating in. Good luck for all!!",4
It was great although I expected a bit more of coding touch,4
"I have always been interested in the fashion industry and found this subject not only informative, but also fascinating to go through. I enjoyed this immensely. Some information I knew, but there was a lot that also opened my eyes.My only negative was the clarity of the speakers English at times which made me have to either listen to the video again or use sub titles, otherwise I would give 5 stars. Other than that, a very informative and interesting course. Well put together and structured. Thank you.",4
This is a really nice course! I am fortunate to be part of it!,4
Great course for people new to business strategy.,4
This was a very nicely organized course,4
"Personally I had trouble with week 2 of the course. I think more details on the types of inputs and outputs with some examples would have been useful. For example, I'm still not sure whether buttons are considered tactile or electronic inputs. It might be obvious to others but I can see see how it can be argued either way.",4
Maybe it would be better to add more exercises to assimilate better the content. Same as previous courses in the Specialization.,4
"Actually the course is great but i am not into history, seems that i have memory issues to memorize these tons of information, greetings for all of you guys and hope i would work with my memorizing issue through the rest of the course :). Thanks",4
"Great introduction to Unity3D and common gaming concepts,",4
"The course is a very good guide on how to get yourself organized following the Together system. The videos are not overly long, the assignments are directly related to the approach and system they are trying to guide you in. This works well for in-service teachers.",4
"More in-depth explanation would be better. Reasonable projects, overall. Well structured.",4
Good course,4
it's really helping and useful...:),4
"The class is very well put together and the instructor does a great job explaining things. I enrolled in this class just to see how things worked on coursera and wanted to do that with a simple starter style course.Personally I think that this course should have stayed away from ui-toolkits and js frameworks (maybe just using something like normalize.css or reset.css). Maybe going into more things like @imports and writing maintainable html. css, and javascript. Anyway, it is minor i guess because in the end you still had to do some overriding of styles so you did write some of your own css.All-in-all it was a fun first course for me on coursera.",4
"Thoroughly enjoyed the teaching style of this instructor. Would have preferred to continue future educating with the same instructor. The courses do account for time out of the education system. Ppl can also sign on at their convenience and the deadline reminders were a life saver. I have already signed up to continue moving forward, keeping an active brain and learning. Thrilled!",4
"A phenomenal, deliberately shallow introduction to Machine Learning. This course definitely cannot standalone but serves as a great start to the specialization.There was a great deal of sensitivity in the course due to the use of Dato Graphlab, particularly since one of the instructors is the CEO of Dato and the software is not free for commercial use. This was exacerbated because the color scheme of the presentation slides matches the color scheme of the Dato website.However putting this aside the material is very high quality. The use of case studies is inspired and helps students focus on when to use particular ML techniques. Although the material is a little shallow (deliberately) you get a good high-level feel for what techniques are applicable in specific situations. However the course can't really standalone, and it's intended as part of the specialization.",4
When the quizzes are reviewed the answers for True False questions should be explained both why the answer was true and why it wasn't false.,4
Skills I will use everyday.,4
"Awesome course! Thanks for everything! It would however be great if you also could provide the Chinese characters for all the stuff we've learned *while* we learn it and not in the end of the course. :) Best,Vinicius",4
Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!,4
"Excellent survey course. Only wish there was more information given on details of daily life, also wish the course was a bit longer. Had issues with verifying the quizes.",4
"This is a simple, practical course that will teach the basics of how to access web resources with python programs.The goal is not teaching you how to write nice programs, but just enable you to write something working to pull interesting data out of existing data sources like files and web services providing text, XML and JSON data.The videos also feature some interesting background.",4
"Very well organised, explained and delivered. Good introdution to good web development. The only aspect I would suggest changing is leaving code visible on screen while under discussion as I found myself going back to see the code after watching someone talk about it. Its nice to see faces but I would prefer to see code as it is being explained.",4
"A perfect introduction to game theory, especially the exercises make you think about the subject.",4
Very practical and applicable information. Great quality in the videos.,4
"Very good, however the inclusion of conference talks tend to be less interesting than professeur targeted lessons.",4
"A really useful introduction to what is data science. I found it very complete, besides maybe I would have liked a little more deepness in some concepts. I'm willing to learn more about the subject, maybe I will complete the whole specialization.",4
Really Good,4
"Very good course, but not much of emphasis was out on downsteam and industrail products",4
"This is a reasonable course, I definitely learned some stuff about mechanics. Things were generally explained well, though there were some things that could have been explained better. The quizzes were very simplistic (the type of multiple-choice questions where you often don't have to actually be able to do the calculations to figure out the answer, you can just look at the options and rule out all but the right one).",4
Some questions confusing (with less than 5 so missing 1 was a fail) and a few videos were lacking written summaries. Other than that not bad,4
Fantastic sauce of information and nice subtle humor.Really interesting material but kind of a depressingly sounding lecturer. Looking forward for more courses from this lecturer and more of blooming of joy in his voice in future lectures.,4
Great hands-on exercises to boost understanding and develop required skills...,4
wonderful course :),4
"As a nonfinancial person, I liked that it is a good clear intro finance. However, I wished there was more reading content available on the site to go more into depth on the topics.",4
"A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course. Many were passed onto ""look this up yourself"", which is fine, but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong. The group_by stuff was especially tricky, as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example, eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns. Other than that, very interesting overall and very neat datasets. I would encourage having students check out kaggle.com for extra credit.",4
Quite informative. All videos are short enough to keep you focused. Key ideas are helpful and practical.,4
good introduction,4
very clear and specific easy to understand,4
it helped me to be more productive and to stay organised !,4
Sometimes the person who is speaking it doesnt inderstand very wellSome exercises it doesnt understand very welltheyll asume you yave more experience that they wanted for this course.I think it would be if they give more examples and exercise for the assigmentsregards,4
"Great introduction into coaching as a manager. However, it left me wishing the course had more to it and that it lasted longer.",4
"Nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering. The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome. Outside of the necessary downloads, recordings, playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear. Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvise.The reason not a 5 is that the grading is cumbersome and time-consuming to set up",4
Its not five stars because there isn't portuguese legends,4
Good introduction to the subject and importantly leaves you wanting to explore a bit more,4
"Well planned and with exciting activities, the capstone was a great final step for the course!",4
This course is really useful for beginners like me. But. sometimes i feel like fast forwarding the course. It was too slow in the middle.,4
"Simple concepts, but it got me out of a rut and has improved my productivity.",4
It's good and well done!but for Italian/European users is not so common to have an Eportfolio (Linkedin a part).,4
Great course!!! I've learned a lot. I don't give 5 stars only because sometimes professors were not so clear speaking.,4
A well designed course that gives great information and window into better teaching,4
"One piece of improvement is to stream line the peer graded assignment. I noticed a slight disconnect between the writing prompt and the grading rubric particularly around the implementation of metrics to track success of content improvement initiatives. What would be wrong to use the grading rubric as a baseline for the writing prompt that can be used as a guideline for student to follow when drafting his response. This would save a lot of back and forth between submitting a blank sheet of work in order to see how the grading is set up, then going back to adjust the original work to make it fit the grading sheet.",4
"This is a great course that has already shown a great deal of utility. I went from this course to Environmental Law & Policy. Right off the bat we are talking about air pollution and property rights and externalities and Coase Theory, etc. So there we are. This was just a random choice of classes and one led right into the other. As I said, a great course and one that I will be able to continue to utilize into the future. Thanks!",4
Very nicely put together course with straight forward examples and well thought out assignments.,4
"Interesting course, but too much theoretical data without providing sufficient practical tasks to remember it better.In other courses they used to have mini quizzes embedded into videos. They are usually very helpful, but here we got none of them.",4
"Thanks very much. Thanks to this course named Work Smarter, Not Harder I found the way which manages effective time.",4
Very useful course， only problem is too short！,4
like this course very much. you will learn a lot,4
"Excellent... It is a representation of our day by day, thanks for sharing your vision, experience and advices...RegardsDaniel Damas",4
"A course that provides an overview of the challenges faced by sustainable development efforts, and the processes the MAPS programme practices to effectively tackle them. I wish I could have access to the detailed ""models"" that were a main topic to more deeply understand the kind of effort that goes into creating and adjusting them, and how they then translate into affecting policies.",4
this course is good . thank you for this information .we look forward more,4
I wish there was a little more meat.,4
"great learning sets and again loved using all the tools introduced, but would love to see this updated with Spanner, Functions and other new features",4
"A great, practical approach to growing a startup",4
"Straight to the point, the only issue is that some lessons has some audio problems but only a minor ones.",4
Decent introduction to the basics of Project Management. Good for those who want to understand the basic framework of project management.,4
clear and simple explanationvery good for beginner like me,4
Good sessions and assignments.,4
excellent examples and very good videos.,4
"Solid introduction. I really liked the self-assessment checks of the coding assignments with rspec.It would have been a nice touch if the coding examples adhered to the Ruby style guides a little better (Rubocop, rails linter, etc).",4
Excelent introduction to the R programming language,4
"frankly, it takes a lot of searching information on one's own, outside of this course.I raked my brains for the most of Saturday and Sunday and finished two last assigments although I still don't feel strong in pandas, neither there is much material left here for me to come back and review something step by step in a systematic way.",4
It's awesome! But It is very very general!,4
"The course achieves its objectives, but the assignments require too much effort for solving general problems, and relatively little for parallelism-related tasks. In other words, understanding what the problem is takes far more time than solving it. The Lego-assisted teaching is a definite plus though!",4
I recomendIntroduction to Data Science in Pythonit is a good piece of knowledge,4
"A little bit ambiguous and vague, however it gets better in the next sessions in my opinion.",4
"Excellent course, very effective teachers, well designed material. Congratulations!",4
Super basic introduction. I liked the last section reviewing data science methods and conceptual ideas.,4
"This topic is excellent, I learnt lots of things from this course. Thanks to Proffers Peter to provide such good session.",4
"I'm not a teacher, but found many aspects of this course very useful to better organize at work or in my free time.",4
Nice overview with detail on smartphones. The course cover a lot of detail and history of the OS's but can get a little monotonous over the different stages of the OS. Sometimes felt like just reading features. Overall I liked the course and thought it provide a very nice overview.,4
The course helps in identifying the tactics that are used frequently in order to get personal gains. It teaches how to avoid them and also use them if needed.,4
I am able to apply to teams and companies I worked for,4
"Interesting course but it is one-sided and focuses on advantages and strengths. For academic honesty there should also be a course: ""The horrors of India"" to balance this one.",4
nice and short course,4
"Great content. Explores the machine learning techniques with the tightest coupling of statistics with computer science. The Probabilistic Graphical Models series is one of the harder MOOCs to pass. Learners are advised to buy the book and actually read it carefully, preferably in advance of listening to the lectures. The quality of the course is generally high. The discussion is a little muddled at the very end when practical aspects of applying the EM algorithm (for learning when there is missing data) is discussed.",4
"Could have explained a little more about what we were doing for some of the modules. For example, in week 6, I didn't really understand the 'deep_features' column or how the values for that column were generated for each picture.",4
"This course was simple. Since it is intended as an overview of few machine learning techniques used to build computer based rational agents it has completely fulfilled my curiosity about what intelligent applications can be built using machine learning algorithms. Professors Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin did an excellent job of presenting the course in an engaging way and with enough hands-on exercises to better understand the lessons.I am excited to take the next specialization courses to better understand the inner workings of each algorithm, and perhaps manage to understand why these algorithms work the way they do, specially the Deep Learning algorithms.Thank you Coursera for the opportunity and thank the Professors Emily and Carlos for such a valuable gift of sharing knowledge for free.",4
I love this course. Very specific. With tons of practical information. Good examples.,4
Good one to understand project management basics.,4
"It's a great course, just not one that can be completed in 12 weeks with a full time job, family and other comitments",4
Very concise and straight to the point.,4
I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this.,4
"I would add some ""flexgrid"" to the course, aside bootstrap.",4
Superb course. Gave me a lot of insights.,4
Nice introduction to problem solving and decision making.,4
"This was a great course. Well structured into the four areas you need to understand to build transmedia experiences. Loved the mix of industry stories with lectures.My biggest bug bear is that ALL of the content is delivered via video. The transcripts are there, but they don't read well on their own. I would really love an eBook to go with this course for future reference.",4
"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places.",4
"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development.The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized.If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn.Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!",4
I believe that this course make me more comfortable writing. I like the lessons and the teacher is very clear in explication.,4
"Good course, ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science. A little java experience is recommended buy you'll probably be ok if you have program in a statically type programming language before because you can pick up java very quickly. The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent expositors but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things.The only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Quiz related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know.In general I recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science, even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses, more complete and detailed.",4
The course was very informative. I enjoyed doing this course.,4
"Fantastic, just want to get that one quiz figured out so I don't loose marks for questions that didn't apply? help",4
Good introductory course!,4
Really nice! Learned a lot! Would have been nice though to get the powerpoint slides and a bit more extra material for us to be able to access it for the final assignment and also for the future! I had a lot of fun taking this course though. Great teachers too.,4
"1.Concise and well structured.2. Allows me to think about the core and the essentials.3. Creates the basics on which I can learn further, deep dive and build expertise.",4
Charles did an excellent job while describing and making a student much interactive in his class. He showed the learning in a very basic way and i personally enjoyed the class. Cheers to the python class :),4
This program was very use full.,4
Good stuff so far: hoping to get more in-depth about specific types of classroom situations (all that pesky cognitive stuff) beyond just the history of approaches,4
"Interesting study, it covered things that I all ready knew but also presented others that I had not considered. Overall a good place to begin.",4
Very good content and methodology.,4
"It is a really nice introductory course on Communication. Includes the basic concepts and helps to influence, tools and channels used in communication.",4
"This course is great to get to grips with the design thinking methodology and tools. Down side is that you only get feedback on your work from your peers, not from faculty.",4
The need update the homeworks,4
very nice introductory course looking at questions of,4
"Very good course. Lot of practical information after first 2-3 weeks. If only the method would have had tiny bit more variation, such as animations, video analysis, case studies, maybe more expert visitors etc. it would have been even better and more durable in long run. But all in all, highly recomended.",4
Spanish grammar is learned by indirect way.,4
I'm hooked on typography now. I've read a number of the books that were recommended. Instructor was interesting and the material was engaging. Would recommend.,4
"Great introductory course on popular software development practices. Some peer reviews could be added in this course to make it more interactive. The course has become heavy on theory side and lacking practical side. However, it is a great place to start learning basic software practices. I, personally, learnt a lot from this course and I would highly recommend this course to all the software developers out there.",4
"For an introduction course, the syllabus is thorough and topics are well explained. Video lectures are well put together and engaging.",4
"Great course, a lot of fun with the practical assignments",4
i think its a good way to introduce someone with little experience to communications science,4
Effectively introduces to the basics of all different machine learning algorithms through case studies. The recommended tools are easy to use and understand,4
Would have liked some more examples for the explanation.,4
"a wonderful introduction to the the law, and a fascinating new educational experience for me as a year 12 student that has provided me with knowledge and insights that are hard to find at this stage of my education. although at times i felt the lectures got slightly repetitive, this course has provided me with valuable skills that i will certainly draw upon in the future.",4
"Its a good course, but I feel too much details in week 3 course content.",4
"Very helpful course for beginners, and congratulations for putting up such a great work together!But a few suggestions -1) Most importantly, the assignments were very VERY hard for starters in functional programming and Scala. It would be much more enjoyable to many more if it's made a little easier.2) The content was great, but I believe a little more (both in breadth and depth) was needed to be covered. Moreover the categorization can be rethought and a little re-organized.Nevertheless, a great course! Will surely recommend this one.",4
Very informative and interesting. The links to various sources in the tests are not up to date though and make it difficult to get a 100% score.,4
This is a good overview of the Data Science track.,4
"Robert Shiller is a great professor, I'd have love to have him as teacher in real life!Said so, however, the course here on Coursera is missing a lot of important informations, which are fundamental not only to have a better understanding but also to complete successfully the exams.",4
The recipes shared are simple to follow...,4
"It's a good course for anyone who wants to start writing as it shows you the variety of methods. I personally gained a lot from the lectures. Likewise, the additional links and the assignments were very useful. Thank you!",4
"Lots of well structured content, easy to follow and informative. You know it's the tip of a large iceberg, so it's a very good way to start and let you wanting for more.",4
Great course. Very interesting and engaging.,4
It is a must for all those who would love to explore vision at the perspective of neuroscience and evolution.,4
Very good course! But they need create more interactive activities and videos for explain theory concepts and show more real examples.,4
IT's a nice introduction into the design world. I enjoyed it.,4
"I really enjoyed learning about astrobiology. We certainly live in interesting times, and this course does an excellent job introducing the students to the current topics and technologies.",4
Very interesting and mind expanding.,4
"Nice course, could use little fixes. Sometimes practice goes ahead of theory",4
"Very interesting and insightful course. I enjoyed it.Assignment was okay, could have provided more challenge and depth though.",4
"Good course to improve your Portuguese skills: there are both audio, video and texts. You learn some stuff about Brazil too but there is too much talking about identity, which is very abstract. I wish there were more podcasts as for Week 5, which was the most interesting one. Thank you to the teachers for this interesting course :)",4
"Very informative. However, some videos have audio problems.",4
I like the class. But It will be most useful if the student can use the same data than the instructor and follow instruction step by step.,4
Would like to see a second part for this course to pick up where it left up. Maybe even discuss further week 5 material and more. Maybe have more coding assignments for part 2.,4
A very good introduction. Leaves one equipped enough to know the relevant areas to advance into ML,4
Learned a lot of the history of food and procedures it goes through to come to our table. This course helped me start making healthier decisions day to day.,4
Videos still need editing a bit,4
"I would like to give this course 5 stars because Robert Shiller is such amazing teacher and lecturer, but I have to give it 4 stars because as is the lectures are not very well edited. A lot of content was left out, and some of the quizzes test material that is not even in the course.",4
Great course. Highly recommend.,4
An excellent course indeed! Strongly recommended for 'everyone'!,4
great course although a few things seemed to be outside of both the course and the book.,4
The course is very ez for me to pick up the python programming.,4
"This course is great for everyone interested in working on their writing skills, whether you're a beginner or more experienced. As a novice writer I learned about several useful tools that will help me improve my writing, got a lot more practice, and having a schedule helped me improve my daily routine for writing. For me the most valuable part was getting feedback and learning through analysing other people’s work. Oh, and just because the description says 1-2 hours of work per week doesn't mean you can't do a lot more!",4
Very good and useful technics with lots of examples to help you understand and memorize,4
"I am in the middle of the course and will continue till the end.The course does show an easy way how to develop a platformer with Unity3D. It covers a lot of subjects, although I have a feeling that I will need to read about Unity again later.Anyhow, it is too fast and the instructor does not really emphasize on important points. Sometimes he also fails to provide proper explanation of some important parameters.Also, the course is tutorial-oriented but it goes so fast I could not really follow the instructions. So, I ended up watching the classes through and do the tutorial later. But as I said, because the instructions are super-quick, I had to watch them again many times while trying to do the workshop.Maybe this is how it should be but I still feel that it could be a little slower and let be breath a little while trying to digest the content so that I can redo the work by my own after finishing the class.",4
"Very interesting course for everyone, who wants to try themselves in SEO and learn more about it.I put 4 of 5, because I hope, that in future there will be subtitles in other languages, except English. It would be much easier in understanding for people from no English-speaking countries.Thanks a lot for new for me information and good luck!",4
"Besides the course free fee, the content is meaningful and worth studying. Thanks.",4
A pretty basic but very enjoyable and thorough course in writing for younger readers. I really enjoyed my time on this course.,4
Great class. Very practical knowledge. I wish I would have taken this class earlier in my career.,4
Really Good,4
dont really like the dependency with dato sframe or prop tools,4
"The course content is really good. However, in the last module, some sentence restructuring would be appreciated.",4
Thank you for those great insights,4
Great course with tools to use anywhere.,4
Great Basics and hands on assignments to get to know a bit about html and css and play around with javascript,4
"Very well-presented course with excellent illustrations. Gives a good overview on addiction with pharmacology, with good links to further reading. I found the title slightly misleading though, as the course presented very little information on brain physiology except for the dopamine receptors.",4
"excellent , actually and well driven by Mr Randy Hlavac",4
Interesting course to start learning about graphs,4
this is a game changer :D,4
"The course is generally very good and met most of my learning objectives, but some of the assignments, particularly the last assignment, are more difficult than I would expect for an introduction to functional programming.",4
It is the most useful class I have ever taken.The teacher were funny and the content were interesting.,4
"I enjoyed the class much, however I would suggest that a little more for feedback could be provided to questions raised by students. Also, PLEASE make the slides available for ALL the lessons.",4
"Great, but with less new content than Units 1 and 2.",4
A great class for easing into the world of Python.,4
"Very good instructor and good structure and pace to the class. Would have liked more real-life examples, and would have liked peer review questions that required more thought and strategy behind them. ""Which channel do you like more"" isn't really that intriguing a question. Instead, a different question could have been ""How might you leverage each channel for different purposes?""",4
Great course,4
Well explained and a lot of questions to practice.,4
"Great Course,very practical. I would improve the examples and increase the number of exercise during the lectures instead of just fastly presenting the pandas functionalities.",4
"Pretty easy, only complaint is that the instructor says the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body. This is not true and made me question the rest of the material in the course.",4
Awesome and a half,4
I missed math.,4
Great Course!,4
"It would be better if the instructor could talk about the difference/advantages/disadvantages vs other languages, and what fields are python most useful over other languages.",4
This is very interesting course of basic of cancelling pathway and the biology of cancer that can fundamental to the study of research of cancer. Thanks.,4
"A good course, but the learning curve in the middle shoots up so the hill is quite steep to climb. Some typos here and there in documentation, but overall a great course that really challenges you to think hard.",4
good explaination,4
"great course, a lot of information, very good topics teached by excellent professional",4
"This is a good course, providing quality information. It has a bit of a financial lean, as the professor has a background in this area; this was stretching for me as an engineer, but ultimately I found it helpful, as the financing of healthcare is an incredibly important issue! Unfortunately, the professor is a bit hard to understand; he does not speak in proper grammatical structure and often rambles or mutters, so even as a native English speaker, I had to turn on subtitles in order to understand the point he was trying to get across. Overall, after taking this course, I feel *much* more versed on the healthcare landscape and all the players involved therein. I recommend this course to students who want to better understand the general workings of the healthcare industry.",4
"Excellent work, gives all basic knowledge to a new comer to web development and HTML/CSS basics. Needs more practical examples if possible.",4
Very informative introduction to sound creation.,4
"Solid course. My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math/logic. Game theory is a math-heavy subject, and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math, a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols (from set theory, probability). It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas, but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch. Otherwise than that, the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching. I highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about game theory!",4
it's a good course in financial accounting foundations and I real liked the idea of the peer assignment,4
I saw a few typos and missing translations in the English transcripts. One minor issue in a quiz/test.,4
"Really interesting subject, presented in an entertaining way!",4
Very informative ! Could use a section with a little bit more figures analysis !,4
too much emphasis on acronyms. Not enough time spent on understanding the concepts,4
"I think it is a very good course, but for me, it was too dense, which led to me not finishing it. More emphasis should be on repetition and deepening of the acquired knowledge.",4
Very fruitful course with many interesting new topics to apply in our everyday life.Thanks!,4
Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough,4
I am really enjoying this course. It's a fun mix of my programming skills and math interests. I Strongly recommend taking Sal Kahn's course on Linear Algebra (@ Khanacademy) or having some Linear Algebra background before taking this course.,4
It was really great course.,4
A great course.,4
"Cool tools with knowledgeable instructor, thumbs up.",4
great course to start learning meteor js,4
Old curriculum but the flow is great. Very helpful. Thank you!,4
"I was a bit dubious about the course to start with, and thought it might be too easy, too full of common sense, but in the second week I felt I was learning things, and boosting my ability to learn and focus, which is so important today. I'm considering further study to help me find interesting work, so this course has really helped to get me on the right track to study again, with a bit more confidence and method. Thank you!",4
Just basic stuffs :D,4
May be it is only my perception of education but I'd appreciate a lot if the course provides more examples and deep review at least for a few of them. But theoretically it was more than full and interesting.,4
"The course assignments are challenging enough to make you move and self teach the concepts, although I found lack of feedback from course curators. I learned mostly reviewing other students work. In general I'm happy with what I learned.",4
It is a very good one thought i would have liked to have an explanation of the answers of some of the two-variable funtions questions proposed in the calculus part. Thanks a lot,4
The course is not free but qualitative and quantitative.,4
Clearly presented and easy to understand. Very helpful.,4
Great course and material! It kept me disciplined and following up on class requirements to ensure learning.,4
"Very helpful for all ages and disciplines.Interview with legendary persons is unique in this course.I wanted to see more on memory techniques, but I guess this will stretch the course further.Thanks Barbara",4
"It was challenging yet fun to learn this course.Last but not least, the http://stackoverflow.com is really helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to learn Python.",4
This is just what it says it is...an intro to guitar. Enjoy!,4
Excellent course with simple language and a wealth of information.,4
It'so interesting and helpful!!!,4
This course provides a good overview of the topic.,4
This is a great intro course to Chinese! I would like to see the characters were written above the words as you learn to simply become familiar with some of the common characters. I am grateful for the access this course provides for those traveling to China to respectfully communicate and show interested in the Chinese culture.,4
Very cool.,4
"Great course series that forced me to take some steps (design docs) that I'd normally skimp on, and in doing so, realizing their true value.Throughout Coursera I'd love to see more instructor involvement in the courses. The 100% peer review system is a double edge sword. On one hand, I never felt I had an instructor looking at my work, but on the other hand, where else can you get constructive critiques on the internet ;-)Overall, great experience. Star-- for feeling a little bit on rails, and not feeling the instructor involvement.",4
I felt there were not enough challenges for the fee.,4
Very nicely done course.I have to note that I was not sure how to get help as I was stuck on a issue. I was able to finally figure out but the instructors are unresponsive :(.,4
I enjoyed this course because it opened up a nice array of new concepts in a clear and understandable way. It's always refreshing to find a well-planned course on Coursera.This is not to say that the course couldn't use a little bit of tweaking though. There are still a few areas where things could be made clearer.,4
"Good course. As the name says, covers the stuff every engineer should know about.",4
Good course for angel investors and entrepreneurs to understand how private equity and venture capital works. It provides a sound introduction to this very exciting topic.,4
"Great course, I've learned a lot, but it is somewhat discouraging not being able to pass the course because I can not pay for it. I don't need the certificate, but I would still prefer getting feedback on the quizzes and getting involved with the assignments.",4
"Map Reduce hands-on assignment does not have very clear instructions, should be improved for future sessions.",4
"It's a great overview, but somehow i didn't feel like it stuck even though i did put in effort to read the articles assigned starting halfway through the course.Maybe it's because there's so much material that will be covered in a hands on part in the 3rd and 4th parts of this specialization... Would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in biotechnology and systems biology.",4
"This is certainly not a course for beginners! The content of the course were rather complex and prior computer science knowledge is extremely helpful to finish this course. It was a struggle for me to finish this course without any background in computer science. However, it was definitely challenging and gave me an insight on how two different disciplines can be connected in a single field of study. The only improvement I could think of is if there were videos regarding the basic computer science knowledge that could have helped biologists such as myself. Perhaps giving an example on how things are done could be useful. There were only a handful of examples and the examples only gave the answers but did not explain how to get that answer well enough.",4
Excellent course. It's easy but inspirational in nature.,4
The course content and delivery ha,4
Very good course for getting a high level understanding of the Machine learning concepts.,4
The course offers good insight into R programming for beginners. A little more application and examples would make the course even better.,4
"Great overview of Machine Learning. I've learnt a lot, so why not 5 stars? I put more time than advertised especially in solving practical assignments with Octave, but it's certainly because of my lack of math background.",4
"Starts off slow, but it soon becomes quite interesting and informative. Some parts were quite vague though so don't expect anything too in depth.",4
Gives a good intro to Data Science and makes sure you get the essential tools downloaded.,4
"I learned a lot from this course, but was disappointed that some of the information and downloads referenced were missing.",4
This course is great to start with. It provides overview of what is in the course and how should we as students be prepared to learn the course.,4
The course is overall great. Maybe a little simple for a STAT major. Thank you!,4
"Awesome course, maybe I'm not giving myself enough time to digest one topic before jumping to another as I needed to refer past topic often, open sourced pdf version of book helped a lot.I wanted to know if it is possible to generated dictionary from two seperate list, and it is possible! I was able to zip two list to form a list of tuple and then used dict() method to form a dict... Might not be important but I felt the course will come a full roung when these are covered.",4
"I think this course it's so good, though is slightly hard to undertand, probably because the teaching metodology I think.",4
great that was,4
Hands on should have been more involved/dificult.,4
Great course about Basic Search Engine Optimization. I learn lot of useful thing through this course. Thank you coursera.org for create such of best online education platform.,4
Thank you so much Dr.Barbara Fredrickson for making the connections to guide us to Positive Psychology !!! I will continue to learn more about Positive Psychology and Loving Kindness !!!,4
"Interesting course but:1) The transcripts for each week are appalling. Here is a copied and pasted example: ""Separatist groups remained active in almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization."" How are those that are hearing impaired meant to understand what the course leader is communicating? It took me so long to understand the transcript that I may as well have listened instead. The subtitles option reads the same as the transcript - not much good for anyone with anything but perfect hearing.2) The estimated timings for each activity are somewhat optimistic. '10 minutes' is the recommended reading time for each week's reading content. Within this reading list are, on average, 8 articles, some of which amount to over 70 pages - if each article is roughly 25-40 pages on average, and there are around 8 articles, how will this reading activity take the student only '10 minutes' to complete?Apart from that, I did really enjoy the course!!",4
The materials are good. The forum is less active.,4
Broadens my view of how to solve public health problems involving multiple stakeholders and actors,4
A very informative course. Thank you.,4
"Excellent crash course in machine learning and introduction to the kaggle data science competitions. However, the grading system had bugs and was unable to accept two answers as correct making it very frustrating. The grader was finally fixed so next round of this course should be a better experience.",4
prerequisites are very mandatory to do this course,4
"Very good introductive course, I enjoyed doing the exercices and the assignments!",4
"Very great course, I get a lot of MongoDB and Mongoid knowledge. This course is hard for the new comer of Ruby on Rails and MongoDB. Assignment is a challenge job, sometimes assignment is a huge job. Suggest that better break down the assignment which over 30 pages. Maybe make this course from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, that is better.",4
"Good overview of available tools. Lack of practice exercises makes preparing for quizzes difficult. However, the course project does a good job to get your feet wet with Shiny Apps.",4
a good start to learn web design from this course.,4
I enjoyed this course. I used it for personal development. It gave great tools and information to think about as a middle manager and how to properly communicate with,4
"I personally enjoyed the course. However I was disappointed when I was told after week (3 or 5?) that I'd completed the course, when I in fact hadn't gotten to the end and had not done the final two assignments...? Regardless, I went ahead and finished the course, but I was also disturbed to see that some of the students did their assignments in a mockery fashion e.g. wrote song lyrics, or stated ""I don't know what else to say so I will tell you about my day..."" That was very irritating. The class wasn't described clearly in the catalog, I thought it would be more of a history of the periods plus literature, but it wasn't exactly that... Instead it was a discussion of techniques and prose, and exhibiting truly talented authors. I liked the class, just not what I expected.",4
"Very good explanations about each topic, some times instructor is explaining basics to get more knowledge on topic. Excellent. Thanks for opportunity.",4
A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course.,4
"I found out I already knew alot of the beginning material in this course. So I just used this course for learning Vlookup, Hlookup, and pivot tables. The histogram section was a nice refresher if you have taken a statistical class before. Very helpful and great examples.",4
Good One.,4
Nice . But It could have been better if we ourselves were supposed to make the Trees and Tries instead of relying on the java's built in classes. I learned a lot!,4
"Good engagement with students. Much better than some of the other courses in this specialization. Video could be a bit shorter, though!",4
It provide a basic framework for stock investment analyze,4
the course outline really equips an individual on how marketing is a core part of business,4
"Gives a good idea of the roles required to build a competent team, dispelling the myth of the all encompassing data science guru",4
amazing course i got more out of this than 12 years of school!,4
little more information of the supporting programs that we are using should be provided.,4
Very good foundation material.,4
This course would be one of the plus point for the job I am looking for.,4
Good Course to get started,4
"Great, easy way to learn style. Highly recommend.",4
Excellent introduction to philosophy applied to business - this really help expand your views.,4
"Thank you, for the knowledge you gave to me through these beautiful Courses.",4
"Overall I really loved this course, and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool. There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load. Not sure if it's a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device, so that has not affected my rating. For anyone considering this course, be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material.",4
The course is mostly theoretical,4
I find the course a very good summary of brand management with focusing on important concepts and definitions.I would like if the professor elaborates more on the Lemonade business example. That would give me a better understanding of how to apply in practice the brand and product management concepts discovered throughout the course.,4
Excelent teacher!!,4
"This course was quite easy.The exercises are interesting, given with their full solution.I think your need Pr. Erickson's book to follow the course.Thanks to the University of Colorado Boulder.",4
"The course is good, but I think it will be even better if it covers more about the 16 tenses, more punctuation, and capitalization. Thanks!",4
It is the best course for the beginners who want to learn java differently.,4
"There were some mistakes and weird glitches, but overall solid overview of second-half chem",4
"I liked the Course, it developed my skills of thinking as a coder, but I did not like the BlueJ programming environment, as I think it required to many clicks to accomplish simple debugging tasks and didn't have user friendly interface.",4
Great course. Would do it again.,4
Yes this was very basic course.,4
"Really interesting course! The introduction to Galaxy and all of the analysis tools is awesome. There is a pretty big cliff between the course content and the final project; it would be helpful if there were more detailed information along the way about what each of the analysis steps means (i.e., interpretation of the information, versus just knowing what file type to select at which analysis step). Based on the discussion board, many students had similar thoughts. Grading the final projects for others is a bit uncomfortable, given that no answers are provided for the counts, and there are multiple different workflows that could be considered correct.",4
Would like to see more examples.,4
"Summary: Overall this is a course worth taking. It gives you tips and tricks into how to learn backed by scientific evidence.I really liked the discussion of focused and diffused modes as well as how you're supposed to chunk things you're trying to learn int small bits to better understand it.The course covers also a bit of neuroscience and how learning really works in the brain. It was interesting to know that the working memory is very limited while the long term memory is basically unlimited so trying to remember too many things at once just doesn't work.The great thing is that the course provides a lot of supplementary material that you can delve deeper into if you want to know about something. One of the papers cited talked about 10 different learning techniques and it was a revelation to me that highlighting text is actually not efficient in learning.Overall the course was nice, I found the quizzes a bit too close to what was said in the lecture. It might have been better to get a reading assignment that delves deeper into something and then some questions on it.",4
"Great course, very edifying.",4
That was a great experience to join this course. I work in the luxury retail and it helps me to have a clear vision of the current and future challenges in this business. I would like to go deeper in each subjects in applying later to a luxury and fashion management MBA.,4
"This course should be divided in 2 o be longer for two main reasons:1) Weeks are way too long to cover all the material, plus the research you need to do outside the platform. The time required end up being too much.2) The course is not deep enough - There's just too much topic to cover, and because of time constrains there are a lot of holes in your education at the end.For this two reason is better con get 2 courses about this topic. That way you can go deeper in to the SQL explanation, and can get at thee same time a better understanding of each topic, instead of getting a lot of thing to cope in just one week.",4
"The course provided a solid, clear, and friendly introduction to the basics of speaking & understanding spoken Mandarin, as well as to how Mandarin is written in the Roman alphabet. Vocabulary and grammar points were introduced at a pace that was never too overwhelming. I'd have liked the quizzes to be based on listening to a dialogue or watching a video and then testing comprehension, rather than just on vocabulary. But on the whole, I was pleased. It was exciting, right as the course was ending, to see that I could have a tiny conversation of the ""Do you like autumn?"" and ""We are taking the subway to school"" variety with a Chinese colleague.",4
Good course inviting the scientific thought process to evolve instead of believing the old stories.,4
"I have enjoyed this course. It presented the one-health concept very clearly and what its aims are which were particularly interesting especially for me who is interested in antimicrobial resistance research. However, some improvements could be made. The presenters with accents / non-English speakers were a bit difficult to follow and the transcripts were somewhat inaccurate so it would be go to have proper transcription in that regard. Thank you.",4
"I have finished it, cool.",4
It would be good to have examples that are not too much inclined towards Maths.,4
"some of the quizzes felt haphazard and too specific, but overall, the material was timely and well presented.",4
This course is very interesting and every data scientist should take time and digest it.,4
"All the content provided is very good and the tests are of a good level too.Was just sad that the course on GI system didn't say a word about the extra organ represented by our microbiome, that nothing was said about the immune system, hematopoiesis, developmental physiology and genetics, the detailed functions of the liver (nothing on the prduction of urea and the detox mechanisms), and some behavioral aspects could be interesting.",4
"it's pretty good. I learn a lot, but some information is not enough, for example TF-IDF, and vector model",4
"I am finding that the material is very relevant to our present era. I see now many news items which relate to the learning available in this course. I like writing about the topics, the activity firms up my understanding of those topics.",4
I think it is best for the lecturer to speak Korean and have subtitles.,4
"A beautifully structured course that I enjoyed very much. All the information presented in it was packaged in an easy-to-comprehend manner by both the instructors. An added bonus - the bonus interviews and extensive resources (most of which I still need to finish) add on re-emphasize the points made in the video presentations. I have started applying the techniques taught in this course and I am sure with practice I will be able to gain a better hold on those techniques and improve my learning.Thank you both Barbara and Steve! It was a pleasant experience taking your MOOC. :-)Best Wishes,Swati",4
"Really digested and simplified for people unfamiliar with financial terms or without an strong background on economics.Strongly recommended to grasp basic, as well as, complex terms and definitions explained in a very simple way",4
Nice course. It provides a general review of neuroscience discoveries about learning.,4
Good information. Very helpful. Could be more entertaining at some parts.,4
"There wasn't a list of suggested Reading, but It is really motivating to make the difference in bus",4
"An essential introduction to the rest of the specialization program, but not too much information included in the course by itself.",4
"It's a nice course, but there are also a lot of things that need improve! Thank you,teacher!",4
very insightful....,4
Its taught very nicely and its an eye opener. :),4
Good and interesting course.,4
I missed some videos showing how to do the matrix manipulations we need for the ML algorithms using matlab/octave...not talking about a generic introduction to it but something specific to what we are trying to implement in the assignments...,4
I liked how there's such an open approach to the course and it gave me a lot of chances to practice design.,4
This course is great. Very interesting world of digital marketing out there that i wasn't aware existed. Found some new great things in the world thank you so much for sharing!,4
Fun & easy introduction to basic concepts in Food and Health.,4
A really great course!!,4
Course is great with actual coding examples so that students can understand how the actual process happens.,4
"Very good course but not as good as the first one :Try monads are never introduced but are referenced by one of the lecturer.Signal DP for mutable state encapsulation is introduced, but it's benefits are unclear until the research paper is read.Exercises are still very carefully designed. Thanks for the great contents !",4
"I really enjoyed this course and felt like I actually learned the material. The only reason I didn't give this course 5 stars, is that due to the issue of giving away the answers to quiz questions, there were a couple of quiz questions that I couldn't understand and unfortunately still don't. I think this is an area that could be improved.",4
Comprehensive overview of disease screenings for clinicians as well as public health professionals,4
Great course. I appreciate the work that went into it.,4
"Very interesting and compelling course, and I liked the questions every few minutes during the lectures as that helps me to retain information.My only complaint is that the lecturer's manner of speaking is very rhythmic and repetitive and that makes it kind of hard to lose track of his words.",4
"Lots of great reference information available in this course that is constantly being updated. The course forces you to finish your project so at the end of the course you have something done which is a 16 panel comic. Doing a cover for your small comic book is optional.It was fun to do for me. I'd give it 4.5 stars if it would allow such scoring. My only complaint is that the course seemed rushed and too short for all that you need to cover and create in some weeks.I still would not hesitate to recommend this course because it is complete. All that is necessary is some very basic supplies. Photoshop may be needed to complete the final week, but I worked around that issue as I think some others in the course may have done as well.",4
Outstanding way to understand our cognitive function! Some obvious stuff but still worthwhile.,4
"it is a good basic course. It is not so complicated, it is interesting",4
"Helpful on a knowing america through other country's eye. However, I think the course would be more interesting if if could include more discussion about how all those country and US view each other now instead of focusing much of its content on history.",4
Good course.,4
This Course has a good and practical approach to conflict resolution in any a Organization.,4
Very helpful in my everyday life. :),4
"simple and easy to complete it, powerful information covering multi topics of graphic design ....but still need more declaration of tasks . thanks",4
"I learned a lot, and i'm going forward in the mastery of IOT. Thank you very much.",4
Should have included more relevant content,4
"Highly theoretical presentation on attributes of TCP vs UDP packets, and also about IPv4 vs IPv6 packets,A little more on advantages/disadvantages of one over the other, some background history on why and how it was developed, response from device manufacturers, and some opinions on future adoption would be great value-added to the course.Thanks, Professor Chung.",4
"Love this course. Nice presentations and video lectures. Would love to see more reference materials in future. Thanks to the team, which helped me to realize where i stand, and where to focus in ""time management and professional productivity"".",4
"Very good material, very good Neo4j hands on for new comers. The critique goes to the coverage of GraphX hands on which, at least to me, is not explained clear enough",4
"The course was amazing, and fruitful.",4
This is by far the best course I've seen on cities. It's amazing. But having to translate all the assignment questions is annoying. Surely all the assignment questions could be translated very easily. Having it in English would make this so much more accessible to African students who aren't francophone. I am South African and want to share this with friends but they find the french too intimidating.,4
"A totally new insights to security. Since I am a Software Engineer student this concepts are going to prove invaluable in my future tasks. Great tutor and Coursera support, love it.",4
This course has fun lectures and very interesting bonus content.,4
Interesting and insightful course indeed,4
"Just the assignments were lengthy & took a lot of time, its should only be MCQ.",4
Great course and wonderful style of teaching.,4
"Could be added more technical question, but I understand that the course is trying to reach as much people as possible.However explaining a bit more details about minerals, which was not mention, would be good. Extending to flavonoids and some other stuff which most poeple is unaware would be interesting.",4
This was a good refresher since I was already familiar with Agile practices.,4
"Pros:A basic introduction to the 3 core front-end technologies. The Professor has structured the course in a logical and easy to follow progressive format. The presentations are professionally done with quality audio and HD video. (The Professor speaks with a clear proper British accent). If watching online, there are helpful short quizzes built into the videos to make sure people are not skipping ahead. (Not sure if these 'video quizzes are graded, but I think they are helpful)Cons:The projects are helpful to reinforce logic and programming concepts, however, they are not real world and may be too simple to be of real value. One will need supplemental resources to fill in the gaps for the projects. I would have liked a real world example, even if it was beyond the scope of the course.",4
"The course is just brilliantly structured. I imagine that this is a set of expressions to start a journey of love with the Chinese language and culture.I did miss a bit explanations on the gramatical structure of chinese sentences. I.e. position of verbs, times, places, pronouns in the sentences. I kind of figured them out, being them different to the structure of western languages. Google Translate helped often to understand this structure and words.The teacher is JUST lovely. Many thanks for a lovely work!",4
I am very satisfied with the course.it was nice.,4
"You can tell there was a lot of work put into this course. I think there were cultural differences for me (this course was french) in the way of teaching that I didn't enjoy. It's great course, but too vague and confusing for me. I tend to like simple logical steps and to learn the core of a concept, the vague stuff for me comes into play when you're dealing with humans in the real word, but I want clarity in my learning before I deal with humans. This one never got to the point so I didn't continue on to the next one. Could be great course for others, just not me.",4
"The course overall is good, with plenty of insights into game theory. However, I wish there could be more concrete examples for concepts such as Bayesian Equilibrium and core. The examples given are too special and is not in accordance with what is given in the exercise.Thanks for the lecturers and mentors!",4
"I would have liked that the written feedback in the assignments were mandatory, it would allow us to improve on our designs",4
"Good content, good ideas, great examples. The forums were a little abandoned.",4
"This wasn't as easy to understand as the HTML and CSS classes. I think it's because it wasn't as clear to me what JavaScript was and how it affected the computer. It sort of felt like jumping into something I couldn't wrap my brain around. That said, I still learned a lot and enjoyed the videos.",4
"I wish the javaScript lesson had more examples, specially for the material at the end of the lesson (functions returning functions, etc.)",4
Great introduction to Machine Learning Specialization and the various algorithms employed in the different courses. In my opinion every Specialization should have an introductory course that covers the various different things that will form the focus of each subsequent course so that students do not start the Specialization and find out down the line that the Specialization is not quite what they expected.,4
"Good introduction into the material. It's great how rating other students' writeups helps you penetrate the material yourself, especially since there are no right or wrong answers.",4
"It is a good introduction for new beginners, interesting and funny. However, not recommended to someone with bases",4
"The course is really great to understand machine learning from scratch! Videos are really instructive and the many quizzes and exercices are well thought. The only (small) inconvenient is that sometimes the learner spend a lot of times explaining some basic concepts making the video a little long. Still, I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning!",4
"Good paced, with very interesting material. Learned both new ideas and also understood older ideas that i didn't quite have a good explanation for. Thanks for a great course.",4
Very helpful topics...Best xml and json parsing lectures ever.,4
Few more examples would be much better..,4
It is a riveting,4
"All in all this was a very good course. Jeremy Ghez is a bright and inspiring teacher. The content of the course was extremely interesting and well put together. I would have certainly enjoyed to have some sections of the course expanded, which was my only disappointment. I thought the assignments were very well handled and def",4
A great gathering of like minded people sharing great local developments in the Greening global economy.,4
nice teaching,4
"I appreciate the nuts and bolts focus on implementation that facilitates development of intuition, intuition that for me at least does not come from presentation of the mathematics in isolation.",4
"I really enjoyed the creative way the theories were presented. Some of the presentations seemed a bit repetitive unnecessarily, like in the Angel and Devil debates.",4
"Wonderful course, except for the hipster slides in the last week",4
Overall good course. I would appreciate if the slides could've been provided. Also some external resources to further study of the topics covered would add value.,4
"The content is good. The delivery of lectures can be more engaging, with aid of visuals to illustrate and emphasize important concepts.",4
"Very interesting, well- explained, and practical course. Unfortunately you need the Excel 2013 professional to complete it and make the most of it.",4
"This is a very good course but I think it can be made better, if there are summary notes associated with the videos.",4
Professor explains concepts well.,4
Pretty usefull,4
good course,4
I found very interesting and useful this course. All modules are nicely designed and framed in relation to learner prospective.,4
"Clear, fast and a perfect introduction for those who are interested in the subject.",4
"I learned a lot of useful information in this course--my first on Coursera--and I'm really excited to see how I will apply the things I learned here in real projects. Although I think that it would be beneficial if the course also required us to submit our code (not just watch and read) and also explain github at least a little, I feel that I am well-primed now to acquire more knowledge of how to make apps in the future. I positively adored the instructor (his accent and way of explanation made it so fun). Thanks, Clement!",4
"The grade system is not fair, but class is good.",4
Course is great. I have one complaint though. Mind mapping is absolutely a brilliant technique but only when done at the end of studying a subject trying to fit together all the pieces.,4
Very useful and interesting course. Thank you.,4
"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a ""mental framework"" for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all.",4
I just watched the videos - but they were terrific and very illuminating. Thanks!,4
Good review of the history.,4
Very nice way of leaning Python programming for beginners !!!!!,4
"Though it was mentioned that this course is for beginners without too much of statistics background, I still feel, some decent background is required to take up this course, particularly the Inference part.Otherwise, the course is pretty good and commendable.",4
Excellent start for the leadership course !,4
Excellent introduction to IoT with both high level history and application information and details on communication technology that has enabled the IoT revolution.,4
Very fun instructor.The peer review as a workshop is perfect.I just wish that there are more poems to study and that it's longer or it has a continuation.,4
Its awesome....and fantastic course,4
"Good course to know the basics of IoT and AR, the references are very helpful to deep in the topics.",4
The videos were very succinct and unobtrusively informative. The professor's approach was very good for a fundamentals course. My only real complaint would be the peer review system being the only provider of grades on the final project. The final grading feedback would be benefitted by the professor himself or a set of trained moderators that have more insight on design conventions.,4
"Excellent course for beginners, the rythm is perfect! I just wish there were more (ungraded) excercices with solutions to practice more on my own.",4
Week 4 was the best and the more appropiate for the specialization.,4
"Dr Heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of Spark. She has covered almost everything from basic to complex, but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations. Since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days. I enjoyed this course thoroughly. It helped me, cementing my basic concept of Spark.",4
Very introductory - can finish the class well before the 4 weeks are over.,4
the course. It has advanced my knowledge and understanding of basic financial concepts which greatly helped me in my career.,4
"A great overview, not any real depth, some practice examples would be nice. Good for those who have never done PM at all as a primer.",4
"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation.",4
"My first on-line course ever. I didnt know what to expect however, I have learned a lot of new concepts. This intro course have me pumped to see whats next. I already ordered my Arduino on Amazon. I dont know what to say but, I'm excited.",4
Well-organized industrial know-hows and useful concepts of business model,4
"An excellent course to start. If you know something about web development is not enough for you, but you want to start from scratch this is definitely your course.",4
This was a good course to learn how to scrape web data and access apis.,4
"The instructions are very good, and it's nice to work on real big data. Also it is very helpful for hearing information about how a data scientist should consider problems carefully. Without taking the class, it wouldn't be easy for me to rationalize for example cost and sensitivity issues.However I took out one star because of the instruction for the final assignment being out of date. Although the task it self is not too hard to figure out. The initial instruction on how to start using AWS was outdated.",4
The course is very good.,4
"Good content, the quiz questions with free-form text input could do with some improvement/guidance.",4
Good Course,4
"A very organized and well guided course. However, the contents are fairly difficult for a pre-university students.",4
"Great start to programming, really liked it! LIttle pricey given the time length.",4
"Assignments were fantastic, course structure was great! Focus was mainly on algorithmic concepts that were then implemented during assignments. Great learning experience. Just that the assignment grading system could have been better.",4
Very good as an introductory course!,4
"Really good course, learned a lot of hybrid development",4
"Very good course and complete... Best Regards,",4
"The course is very good. My only point of concern is the installation procedures of packages, where the instructor either is installing an old package or not using any new installation procedures causing students to have a whole lot of issues with setting up their development environment",4
easy and fun,4
"The concepts and techniques in this course are very helpful, and I appreciate that multiple approaches and techniques are shared - learning isn't a ""one size fits all"" situation and I found that, while some of the techniques suggested have not worked well for me in the past, other techniques from the course have really opened up my understanding of my own learning process.My only complaint about the course is the quality of the videos. I'd love to see the course updated with less errors and sound drop-outs from the recordings. Perhaps one of the students who has benefited from this course, and also has video editing skills, could help out!",4
Covers the basic effectively.Hope it's useful for the upcoming courses,4
Very well informative.,4
very helpful to have an introduction to this topic. Also good to learn from many studies contacted on the field and presented here,4
"A very good intro, and everything works. I loved it",4
"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
Good introduction,4
"This course was very interesting and provided lots of advice for studying and learning. I bought the companion book, ""A Mind for Numbers"", which I found pretty useful as a complement (though is not strictly necessary!). I recommend this course to anybody interested in how to learn effectively, but specially to students in college or university -- they are the ones who can gain the most out of it.",4
I learned quite a bit from this instructor in a short period of time. He has a way of explaining things that really makes it sink in. The one thing I would change is not to have so many chords to learn in one week toward the end of the class. I would add a few weeks to the course.,4
Very nice and clearly presented. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that I would have liked more details and more lectures.,4
"Mindshift as a course was ""easy"", and ""helpful"". What i have learnt from the course can be applied to my life to make it slightly better. There is a wealth of exercises in self-help today on the internet and from books. It doesn't hurt to do this course, its well put, and you learn new things(sometimes). What you gain from this course is ultimately dependent on how much you are able to exercise the points of this course. Given the small amount of time you are investing in completing the course (it is a very low requirement course and you can finish it in 2 days if you want to, although that is not recommended), i would suggest you take it, since the investment pays off depending on how new you are to the material and how much you are able to put it to use.",4
Great course to learn the basics of writing and to get a broader view on what i means to be an author of children's fiction.,4
"All in all, this was a tough course, and the programming increased progressively as one moved on. Week 1 was OK, but I experienced a temporary hiccup in week 2 in the reading of the codon files; until I converted them to Strings. Even then the first file which contained only one DNA string gave its fair share of problems. In general, the section on Strings was pretty comprehensive. The programming was also pretty challenging. The section on debugging was OK, but I am at this stage still a little confused as to the amount and detail of information one is supposed to supply to someone else when you are experiencing a problem with your code. With the week 2 quiz I made a mistake than came back to haunt me in week 4; I did not read the question properly and from the outset my cgRatio method was not producing the correct answer. Eventually, after reading the specs for cgRatio again, I realised my mistake, could correct my code and get through the week 2 quiz! Week 3 on parsing, reading CSV files etc, the going was pretty good and I managed to complete the work covered in this section without too many problems. Week 4 on baby names; well, yes the mini Project was pretty extensive, with a lot of Methods being asked for and written. I found the small test files to be invaluable during testing. But the quiz contained a few curved balls. Method totalBirths does just that, and although in the specification it does say that it should also print the number of girls and boys names, and the total names in the file. Q1 and 2 tripped me up, I did not read them properly, and entered the total number of births for the girls and boys respectively. Questions 9 to 12 also resulted me in having to call a temporary halt, and write an additional method that looped over all the files from 1880 to 2014 in order to get the answers to those questions. Fortunately, method getRank came to the rescue here, doing all of the hard work!This was a lot of work! I did ""week 4"" in one week, but only because I was already on leave and could focus on the mini project for the entire week. The entire course took me 6-7 weeks to complete.I learned a lot. It was a good course, and very challenging. My greatest concern with the format you are using (80% or you don't move on - or you don't qualify), is that one can become ""unstuck"" as I did in week 2, but managed to get past that one.",4
It's good to understand the way our brain works when we're learning and how to turn it.,4
Interesting. Would like to see more focus on national policies.,4
Was well structure until the part about accessing parsed data in JSON; this was a little rough as the example provided in the lecture accessed data like: parsedjsondata['person']['age']. In the actual assignment this does not work and I had to use a work-around by using range(len(dictionary)) which is not covered in this course.,4
I'd recommend to anyone.,4
Good to know the data analysis trend and useful tools.,4
This course aggregates a lot of best practices how to learn better. Barb goes in deep explanations how our brains are working on both high and low levels. Seems like fall of the course mostly targeted for sturends,4
"A little too basic, and a little too talky. But a good foundation, and well presented at its level.",4
"Very interesting course on the Arctic. As an introduction, I appreciated the broad overview of the things affecting the Arctic and thus the global climate. As a neophyte, some of the more technical, scientific aspects were hard to follow but were just as interesting to understand; having the course notes to go back to was helpful!",4
Very informative and educational. Case studies was relevant.,4
"Thanks, great course!. I'm trying to learn more about ML",4
"Just the tip of the iceberg, you'll want to dive in on each topic.",4
"It is a good course, but a bit short in my opinion",4
This is great course as Intro to Statistics,4
Have no Chinese sub，most API can't use. Homework is not suit for teaching.,4
"great course, but the assignments are somewhat easy....",4
"Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out. There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignments moreso force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work arounds. I occasionally felt the homework could have been structured to more step by step steer me to use concepts from the most recent lesson.",4
It was interesting: you get information on learning techniques. But don't expect a miracle: learning does require work and time.,4
Good Topics and learnt the unkwon,4
"I did learn a few new things, but I would have to say the course is very easy to pass. The hardest part is the essay questions, but these are optional. Anyone having basic knowledge of Egyptian history could pass all the quizzes without doing anything else. You only have to get 50% correct.The recorded lectures were good, but not great. The speaker is reading the transcript and it seems like for the first time. He is not speaking naturally and it's a bit stiff.Nevertheless, for someone just starting, the course has all the essential information needed and you will learn a lot.",4
Great information on the topic of influencing people.,4
"The terminology is likely to be difficult for ESLs, and the guidance is likely too easy for native speakers.Spent most of the time on 2.0x speed and multitasking because it wasn't nuanced enough.",4
One should take this course in order to overcome the fear of learning any difficult skill or subject.It provides very helpful information pertaining to our common learning patterns and mistakes we do in studying.,4
"Pretty nice course, although installation and pre-requisites could use a higher note before installing since there would be a couple of tries before getting them working.",4
"Very good lecture in selected content and presentation (interesting, motivating, concise and precise).The course could improve by providing a written script in addition to the excellent lectures, as this would make summarizing the material and preparing for the tests easier.",4
Good enough for a fast start.,4
Really great one!!,4
"Good, practical advice.",4
"It's a great course to learn the basics, plus you get testimonials about how some are doing in the business. Mostly younger college students but never the less, still useful.",4
Quite an engaging course from very modest Prof. Bob Schiller. My first on line course and it was a very satisfying experience.,4
"what is good about the course is that it is a small course in time and to the point, hope to learn more",4
"Overall, I liked being exposed to Github and GitBash. I felt this course gave me a broad overview of what to expect in the future!",4
great course for basics,4
I like this MOOC because it gave me a complete and clear picture of Social Media Marketing.,4
All of the content for the program was excellent. The only issue I had was that the video quality on some of the instructor lead excel examples within the video was very small and I could not read it. I found it difficult to follow especially I had to go over it three or four times increasing the screen etc. in order to get what I needed from the instructor lead examples otherwise it was an excellent class. I believe it more than prepares someone not aware of all the capabilities of Excel to see the possibilities and to apply them going forward in business or in their personal life.,4
"I did learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and plan on learning more on my own. I enjoyed the course overall but felt like it should have been longer and more introductory for those of us who knew nothing about programing concepts.",4
A very basic course for Cloud and Big Data. For a laymen its good choice to cover all basics but not for a technical person.,4
"The course is insightful and teaches real-world application of some social media strategies. However, it is not enough by itself; the specialization as a whole will be useful.",4
It was my first course at Coursera,4
I think the pace is a little,4
Informative but difficult course.,4
Interesting!,4
Provides very good understanding on Business strategy,4
Very helpful course. I liked a lot. Although I would prefer for some quizzes not to be locked unless paid.Thank you for sharing your knowledge.E.,4
Its good,4
very very useful n knowledgeable.,4
Very good introduction to machine learning with good examples.Some questions in the quiz could be rephrased to avoid multiple possible interpretations.,4
"A little bit steep demand curve regarding to what is offered in the lectures.Well, well... The whole world knows that ""they"" are a little ""thrifty"" ;-)",4
It covers all the programming basics that are required for the setup of ARDUINO setup.Very helpful.,4
Clear and concise with useful tips.,4
"The fact that test cases are not available is extremely frustrating and time consuming. I absolutely disagree with the instructors about the reason why test cases are hidden.Michael LevinHi,Learning new complex things is time consuming, it is essential, and it is ok. Without this time spent you wouldn't have learned even half of what you've learned while trying to find your mistakes yourself. Also, the testing techniques presented here are indispensable in the real life, and many learners of the Algorithmic Toolbox course have already confirmed thisHello Mr. Levin,First please forgive me for communicating with you in this place. I am not sure if there is a direct way to answer you, but I believe you will have access to my response.I entirely agree with what you said that this needs time and I do not mind spending time learning new things. That is why I am here in the first place. But I think that hiding the test sets misplaces the balance where this time is being spend.Let me give you an example: week 3 – hash chains - assignment no. 2. I wrote the app, submitted this and it failed on test no. 5. Having generated tons of test cases I was nowhere closer as all looked good, but still failed your engine. As it turned out the problem was not with the algorithm implemented but with the presentation layer. ‘Check x’ command when x is not found in the hash table should return blank line and my program returned nothing. I could not find this in the specification hence lots of hours trying to figure out the solution.It was not a bug with the program, it was the problem how the data is presented. I do not mind spending time developing solutions to the assignments. I would love if there were more advanced (even optional) problems to solve but I want to spend this time on the algorithm and solving the task rather than trying to figure out how to display the data.Please, do not get me wrong, I absolutely adore the course, lectures are brilliant and my opinion should be regarded as a constructive criticism even if you do not agree with me. Thank you again for what you are doing.Regards,Marcin",4
"a bit of mumbling in the videos, and some of the single/multiple answer buttons were incorrect.",4
"You can find your object in this course, but this course is too platitude to make me feel boring...",4
This course is very interesting and educational. I really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that sometimes there wasnt any translation from spanish.,4
"I really found this course useful in understanding some basic concepts of programming, Dr chuk really gave a distilled understanding of these concepts and i think having him as a tutor was really the key.",4
Great course,4
Some of the quizes and assignments had grading issues but I thought the curriculum was great. All of the optimization techniques learned to solve for regressions seem like they could be useful in other areas of machine learning and other applications.,4
"This course could do with harder assignments. This last one was just ""run my code"" and screenshot stuff. Learned a lot though",4
"Great course. Very well explained topics. The only criticism would be on lack of tests in coding tasks, and only one language supported. (Java)",4
"It is not five stars for just one reason: it think it could be better if having not so long video. Please, professor Amar split the 22minutes/31minutes videos in small portions.Notwithstanding, it was amazing and inspiring to know how democratic the American Constitution creation process was. Unfortunately, because the socialism and communism influence in our country we do not have much information about everything which have to do with American history and culture.You American people would be proud their history and take care to things go on at the same way.",4
I enjoyed the course very much but found the assignment very frustrating. Despite trying numerous ways with the data provided I did not get the same map coverage as the instructor and there was no explanation as to what I might have done differently despite a number of people asking the same question in the forums. It was still possible to get full marks without but it would have been more satisfying to get the same answer.,4
A good course to learn all the basics of DATA SCIENCE !,4
"A great introductory course to Machine Learning for anyone with experience programming. It's presented as a survey of various Machine Learning techniques and I appreciated seeing many motivating examples for the topics covered. The hands-on examples were accessible, but at the same time gave familiarity with real-world tools like IPython.",4
"Thank you again... I really enjoyed the course! Great taster of modern & contemporary photography as well as artists who have made an impact on the craft. That said, I would love to have seen & learned more about the early photographic techniques, processes & images, i.e. Daguerreotypes, etc.",4
I found this course to be very interesting and informing.,4
Course covers the basics and key terminologies related to PMP.It will be useful to have a few numericals/assignments to calculate Duration/Time using different methods and the associated impact of cost.,4
pace is too slow. more exercises would be great,4
"The content of this course is really interesting and intriguing, but it would better if there are additional sources and information. Also, instead of mainly picture the teacher in the video, it would be nice if there could be more graphics and diagrams to illustrate the idea that the professor is trying to convey. Besides those minor deficiencies, I would say that this is a really good course and will worth your time.",4
Interesting approach.,4
I'd highly recommend this as an introduction to Sociology. Particularly beneficial for those with no previous experience of the subject.,4
"Excellent course content and lecture, however, the homework design is not so friendly for students.First, instructions are not clear. I spent a lot of time in figuring out the real meaning behind each problem. Second, the judge system is not so rigorous. Though trying best on homework and not playing tricks are students' responsibility, the judge system is just too weak to survive those hackings.Thank you all for your efforts.",4
Mind Blowing course...!!!,4
I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. What I would improve - reference material from upcoming weeks should be organized (or at least added as recommended reading) if it helps the current week assignment.,4
good course!!!,4
"The previous Coursera forum format was far more useful than the current, new, format used in this course.",4
Very Good Course and contents. Colleen has explained every concept very deeply and descriptively.I have enjoyed the learning.,4
Great course delineating all the fundamental principles. Some parts of it maybe a bit too easy for people with decent linear algebra knowledge but definitely a comprehensive and worthwhile introduction in the exciting topic of Machine Learning. I'm definitely motivated to learn more !,4
Curso bastante básico de Ruby on Rails.,4
"Modules are easy to understand and logically taught, lecturers have an understanding of teaching and teaching material which in itself is necessary! Well spoken and articulate.",4
"Some very valuable learnings from this relatively easier course. I'll be taking my personal brand way more seriously now and with some concrete ideas I got from this course.Could have been 5 star if there was a bit more depth to the course. The 1-on-1 on twitter was not really needed. If someone can find out about coursera, then not knowing how to use twitter was far fetched possibility.",4
Great course! Thank you very much Professor!,4
"I liked that the lecturer is not wasting my time but also takes pauses: that's a great balance! I liked that the course is short (it took me two days to complete it). Information is relevant and worth thinking about. Especially for those people who haven't been thinking about it before.I would improve design components of the course: typography of letters and all writings. It would make a course much much better. It could be done easily for the person who is familiar with this, but would make the course much much better for another people.Thanks, Margaret Meloni and her team!",4
Great C,4
tutors made really amazing effort to make such a difficult course to learn easily.,4
"The course was really helpful.Considering the fact that I was not from security background, it went very smoothly",4
Support material is decent but some more examples in video lectures would be good,4
Great introduction to the topic. Great teacher. Too bad it's so short.,4
"Though I have worked in MNC with and people across the globe, learning the theoretical aspects of business helps you understand the process better and hence improve your work.Best Wishes.",4
It would be nice to have more complicated assignments which push brain to work harder,4
"Quite a fast-paced course, with very quick and packed lectures. Would have preferred the course to be slightly longer e.g. 6 weeks and covering more content. I actually found the style of the coursework to be a plus - though it involved a lot of Googling, this is more reflective of real life, where answers aren't just handed to you on a plate. However, the instructions for the assignments aren't very clear in places, which can easily cause you to become stuck.",4
"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point.Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises.",4
"it‘s easy to understand, suitable for ABC.",4
Very interesting and thought-provoking!,4
I liked the course a lot. Very interesting!,4
It was a good one for basic learners but there were less explanation on several topics,4
"At the start, I felt this course was mostly uninteresting, irrelevant and unnecessary. Pretty much a waste of time. But as things progressed, I discovered there were lots of great theory and concepts introduced that play a critical role in how the game industry and professionals need to think and work.My only complaint after having completed this course is that the instructors didn't do a good job explaining why this course should be taken. Once you're in and working your way through, you should see the importance. But on first glance it sounds irrelevant.",4
"Great course, lots of interesting material!However, I wish this course was not so fast-paced. If more time was dedicated to every subject and more examples were provided, that would make a learning process more effective.",4
Topics are explained pretty good,4
Good introduction to important workflow concepts for creating and designing publications from scratch,4
"I would like to recommend the course for everybody to want get good knowledge in cloud technology. It's help me a lot to figure out the market trends. From now on, I got a big picture about the differents types of the clould services. I very excited to the next step. I also to hope you enjoy it.",4
Sue Robins is an excellent instructor in the art of business writing. She will help you navigate the nuances and best practices behind a good business document,4
"This course is really amazing in every way, very clear, understandable, and pretty usefull.Only one bad point : nothing about decision tree learning.",4
Pretty nice course with strong focus on accessibility and correct semantics of HTML5 code. Found it useful but a little bit limited in terms of real practice.,4
Great Course!,4
Interesting,4
The lectures are well explained. But the programming exercises are too basic . Expected the programming assignments to be more challenging . Good course but each week could be completed by 2-3 hours . And the 6 week course can be completed within 1 week by casual work . But its a good introduction to access web data using python . Recommended for beginners .,4
Improvement over the first course. Most of the material did not require many references to the apple documentation in order to complete the assignments. Final project was comprehensive and built on previous work. A major flaw of this course is that it is not updated for the newest version of Swift. Many of the techniques and methods taught will not translate to Swift 3.0.,4
A basic course design for individuals who want to learn GCP.,4
"The course is in fact an overall intro to the full data science specialization. Some of the content are useful; but some of the quiz questions are not very informative, and don't really test on stats...",4
"The course was nice but not structured very good, especially week 4. From time to time you have a feeling that this course is more like a compilation of lectures made for other courses with similar topic. Especially confusing are moments when during the lecture author references previous materials you expected to know from lectures you've never heard. That's strange.",4
"I'm doing this training for the second time, now as a beta-tester. Particular comments about lecture content, problems, etc. have been put in every lecture.General comments, in short:1) Related to the new platform and UI design:_ It is cleaner and simpler than the previous one. I like it, BUT..._ It lacks of some useful features: saving intermediate results in quizzes before submit them; calendar; limited number of subforums._ The most relevant flaw: there are not downloadable versions of lecture slides. Unacceptable! No way to check most of the links we saw in slides (URLs not visible)._ Description and steps in course project appear ""too packed"" together. I prefer the former design.2) Related to content:_ The course is mainly for preparing students for the rest of data science specialization program. When you said ""toolbox"" you mean the concrete toolbox you will need to do the program. Some people expect to have a general introduction to data science but that is only a half of the content. I think this is clear enough in the presentation but for some reasons there are people in forums who protest the content, so maybe you should insist more in this fact._ I would like to suggest some kind of reorder of material: week 2 is all about installing a running tools and week 3 about key aspects of data analysis. Maybe you can split both types of content between wk2 and wk3 to make wk2 more appealing for not technical oriented students._ Git is a source of problems for a good portion of people. See my comments in lectures about how Git is explained.",4
i really enjoyed this course. We should be more carefully with the food we eat ad its quality.Thanks for this great course.,4
"Slides and videos are a bit insufficient in order to finish course projects.Apart from that, this course is awesome!",4
"Barely anything you don't already know or do subconsciously. But the little that you don't know, will help you understand and remember new concepts more effectively.",4
The content was very extensive but due to the fact that I'm still in secondary school some of the content was over my head and targeted towards people that have been in the field for a few years.,4
This course is okay,4
"It is not perfect, but as an open course it is impressive.",4
Highlight: The concept of the course itself is great and the course is well structured that makes it easy to follow. It was very basic yet had a lot of new information that will help advance in more detailed programs.Lowlights: Need more focus and details on the Cost module.,4
good starting course; information well presented.,4
Thank You for the course.,4
"Overall the course was very helpful and I was able to understand it without prior knowledge (except for my high school biology class). All the case studies examples often helped to understand the problem further and I appreciated all of the graphic content that was crucial for imagining the ways the systems work. I finally understood some of those things, that are just sort of ""known"" as for example why contraceptives might be bad for women, or how could drinking too much water actually kill someone.I was a little bit disappointed with all the gramatical mistakes in presentations and many mistakes in english subtitles that were provided (in names of organ parts/hormones etc.) ow switching the names of certain hormones/parts in spoken language, which often made it harder to understand or connect something. Furthermore some of the quiz/test questions were more like ""just guess it"" or up to the student to research the problem further, which is fine but it kinda disrupts the quizzing process.Many thanks to both great teachers that have put this course together, it's definitely worth enrolling in!",4
Neural networks lectures need to be more decipherable.,4
Great course overall. It looked though as if some of the lectures were cut and pasted from some other course into the content and were not as coherent as they could be (particularly the case with the last week's material on FRP).,4
Great course!,4
Good overview of Data Science but lacking a bit of meat.,4
"This course is really helpful especially for people wanting to write English articles better. The course outline is well laid out, videos are easy to understand, and exercises are very helpful for practicing your punctuation. The only negative point for me is how the teachers use a very strong American accent that some of the letters in a word are not pronounced anymore, like 'meanin' instead of 'meaning' and 'writin' instead of 'writing'. It doesn't really affect the teaching, though. All in all, this course helped me a lot and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their punctuation and review their English grammar knowledge.",4
This was a nice but easy course for one having basic knowledge of Python. Liked the way of taking assignments. Thanks to the instructor Bill Boyd sir ..,4
"Basically good. As I want to know the practical guidance of how to conduct a RCT, this course is not sufficient .",4
I enjoyed this course immensely. I wanted to gain a general idea of what the science or belief behind Philosophy was. This course gave me just that. A good over view of the subjects and the ideas behind it.,4
it was a great experience.,4
very interesting learning experience,4
Very expensive certificate for little material.,4
"Well done. Focuses mainly on videos to teach the content with an assignment at the end of the week that uses everything you learned. I would rate 5 stars if it had more quizzes or exercises to do before the week's assignment. At any rate you learn a lot about Html, css, and JS and it's a worthy class in this specialization.",4
I would like a little explanation about coloring,4
"The instruction was clear and simple. The one topic I'm still having trouble with is the way Divs are positioned. The concepts around floating left and right make sense, but, when I put it into practice, I was not getting the same results as I was expecting. I would love to see a follow up video on this topic to make this concept simpler for me to understand.",4
it's very beneficial and contain many references,4
Useful and helpful strategies and information about nutritional cooking.,4
great course but wish to have more materials or explanation on svd and PCA part.,4
"This is a very dense course, offering a quite detailed information and technique on negotiation. While the focus is very much on business deal negotiations, one can pick up transferable skills to apply in other areas. While the knowledge gained through this course is not directly applicable in my area of work, it is a useful course to have taken.",4
"At the start of Week 1, the course was a bit boring (too slow, too easy), but things were becoming more and more interesting: We were able to see many up-to-date technologies used in companies, several protocols, market tendencies, many competitors/actors,I recommend to students to open an account at AWS, Azure, GoogleCompute and create their own exercises (it is mostly free for limited usage).",4
"Nice, quick and effective!",4
Really helpful. I really enjoyed getting familiar with plotting systems and also increasing my abilities dealing with data frames,4
Good course for anyone like to learn management of projects and how to start it,4
Not a five star review because this course is more like an introduction to programming on Java and best fit for a beginners. So that said this course is more about programming tools and project setup than a programming at all.,4
I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.,4
"Awesome, very short though. A lot shorter than the first one.",4
The last module and the final paper was a little confuse for whom is not from Biology (I'm from computer science). But the course is very well made and gave me the notion I'd like to have. The professores are very well qualified and inspired me about the subject.,4
"Overall course was good. I think there is a bit of a gap in terms of helping providing additional understanding of application of some the concepts in context of a solution. I think the course does a good job explaining the concept, but I feel the course could use some additional examples of application of the concepts to help facilitate the programming assignments. The Swirl exercise are good...but almost seem to rudimentary.",4
easy for newcomer! Great!,4
"This course was a very informative intro not only to digital marketing, but also to marketing as a whole for those who may not be ass familiar with the basics of marketing. I'm looking forward to taking the rest of the specialization.",4
Scala from the source! Great way to get a great introduction to the language and how it is best applied to problems,4
"Easy and interesting, but the content is a little bit thin..",4
Foundations for Global Health Responders offers an introduction to global health issues tailored for those interested in global health missions. The course includes video presentations and discussions by numerous physicians associated with the University of Colorado School of Medicine as well as several other subject-matter experts. I found the presentations and supplemental materials helpful in gaining a basic understanding that I can expand upon in the future. Well worth your time if you are interested in participating in global health missions but are not sure what area you might like to focus on!,4
A very useful and intriguing course that explore the idea of learning. Every life long leaner can find this course helpful.,4
"I really think this is a good course, but some of them is hard to understand for me as beginner.",4
It is a fantastic course. I loved it. It fits my interests.,4
javascript was disconnected to html and css a little bit.,4
This was a great course. It gave an amazing overview of the Business Idea and Opportunity. It allowed me to understand the overall process. I now know how to choose what business idea to develop and also what steps there are in launch. I learned some things here that I never knew about prototypes and how to test a service business. I do wish there were more of a focus on the Service Sector. Many people these days are creating businesses in that sector and it would help me to have a better understanding on those topics.,4
Good basic learning course in javascript. Most of the students dont know even the simple basic concepts related to web design. Those can be covered in this course...Happy Coding Everybody.,4
good foundational couse,4
"The course is very good. I have learned a lot of things from the theoretical and practical parts of the course. I like the mathematical derivations and the signal of the day. I wish you can give advanced course about adaptive filter design, advanced digital communications and audio processing. Thanks to the staff!",4
"it was really helpful , wish we get report on our submission .thank you so much .",4
"Straight-forward, basic",4
This is an interesting topic which I have never really given a thought before. Eye-opening and really make you think,4
Really great theoretical introduction to various Machine Learning algorithms.,4
"covers a lot of ground quickly, but you still get a good understanding of the underlying theory or technologies",4
"I loved the elaborate structure, but they should provide a certificate",4
Thorough overview of relevant topics.,4
"This was a great course and gave me a very good starting point for HTML, CSS and JS. The only negative I found was that the JS module seemed a bit rushed and the assignments at the end of last two modules didn't really test my understanding of JS concepts very well. They were too simple because the starter code had a lot of things already written out. Making them more barebones and having the student fill out most of the details would be a more hands-on and useful activity in my opinion.",4
"This course introduces very interesting concepts, the Professor is very entertaining and the Syllabus is very clearly structured. Thank you!",4
Content is not updated. Now is 2016.,4
The questions are hard to understand and ambiguous though their answers are easy.,4
This course has given a good introduction to the broad topics of ML and what I will be taught in the next 5 courses in the specialisation and gave me a reason to be excited.,4
I felt like the Octave tutorial was a little light.The concepts were explained well through the videos. Intuition was given which is always useful. I think an improvement would be more examples in the videos or as example sets for the sections to help. Jumping straight into the assignments without applying the lessons first in a mistake-allowable environment is a bit daunting and can feel overwhelming.,4
"The material in this course is very interesting. I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms. I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry-level manner - it will take some hands-on practice with real datasets to build expertise, understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base. I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming. I completed the Python for Everybody specialization, but still struggled with the programming in this course.",4
Well organized and the videos explain a lot. The are some resources named in the videos but the links are missing.,4
I love this course it is very useful for me.Thanks for this course.,4
"Is a nice course to learn about the different styles of leadership, how to work better in teams and which are the best outcomes of a negotiation.",4
good introduction!!!,4
"Interesting course, but rather too short and not going very deep",4
Very well prepared content to get enough knowledge on basic HTML5. It definitely help the beginners to expand their knowledge on HTML5.,4
Very good beginner level course,4
"Course assignments have nothing to do with the lectures. Most of the assignments could have been copy-pasted stuff from the previous course in this specialization. Same as with previous course - review point organization leaves too many space for individual opinions. Assignment with a video clip is something I didn't expect at all. I had to download a bunch of free software to make it, and I didn't make it good enough, because I'm not skilled in using those programs. Of course, it then reflected my average score, because review point system is too much oriented toward personal opinions of others. I felt this course gave me the least out of this specialization, and I also felt this course scratched a lot of things, but didn't quite get into many details that could have been mentioned (maybe even instead of the assignments that were quite dull to me). There is a section of clips that is a bit useless to those outside of USA. Unlike previous course, this one was at least doable inside the expected work hours / week (except for the video assignment which took me a bit more), and that's why I'll give it 1 point higher than previous course.This review might sound a bit harsh, even though it's not the intention. With a bit of polishing, it could become really great, but it really could use some of the improvements I have mentioned above.",4
Give students a whole picture of the MNA and relative techniques. Also provide us with useful tools which can be quite helpful during work.,4
Best course. Very easy to learn new language with this course.,4
Great,4
I enjoyed learning this class. I was interested in the scientific aspect of music.,4
Its a good course to begin with FHIR Technology . But I expected more technical detailing in the course module....,4
Punctuation overwights grammar in this course.,4
"A great introduction to Meteor.js. I really appreciated the simplicity of each module. I found the final assignment to be easy to get passing marks, but just the right challenge to get full marks. Totally recommended if you want a quick introduction to the buzz that is Meteor.",4
"Great course. Really good for those who want to be managers/leader, and those who are already leaders. Lots of reading required, but it is OK.",4
Michael Pollan is wonderful! Great fundamental tips. Music can be distracting. Maya's speech is a bit slow...Pollan's pace was stronger. Visuals were clean and easy to digest. Content was succinct and memorable. Appreciated the brevity of the videos. Thank you.,4
"While the course was great, the Jupyter notebooks and the background shells gave me several unnecessary errors. While this was a smaller issue, I think the practice Notebooks should be somewhat in line with the assignments. I struggles on Assignment #3.",4
A great introductory course to Swift!,4
"Good Course. It should be complemented with reading of Neuman, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Social Science, which gives a far better overview of the contents of week 1 and 2 (insights into the scientific method). Nevertheless the rest of the weeks are very good and should provide a great framework of Quantitative methods for a undergraduate student, who can then complement this framework with some detailed additional readings, if it is of his liking. All in all, I really ended my fisrt college semester with an excellent knowledge in quantitative methods, for which I have to thank, in part to Miss Scholten for this wonderful course.",4
Great course! Everything is explained extremely clearly. The only 'missing star' here is that some of the final quizzes reject the correct answer due to a technical issue.,4
I missed a lot of it because many NPM modules wouldn't install on my Windows environment. :(,4
but more depth is required,4
good corse,4
"Great course, a lot of hard work though..",4
Very useful for amateur learners. Thank a lot University of California!!,4
"Well done, but perhaps a little bit more depth required (foe somebody with 30 years of experience in large organisations).",4
The way the proffessors deliver there speech is amazing and in a very lucid manner.One-Liners questions between the videos is really a nice way to enhace students mind so he remains involved and keeping him/her bound to that topic.I really appreciate the efforts of proffessors who taught me and all other students out there selflessly and with utmost devotion wihout asking anything in return.SPECIAL THANKS TO COURSERA.,4
"this course is well-organized although with the course going on i t goes more difficult, it is also a good challenge for us.",4
"Interesting course, useful principles and good animation lecture.",4
A comprehensive introduction to machine learning.,4
Interesting and informative. A good entry-level course for those looking to get a clearer picture of the PE/VC space. I found the financial side of it a bit difficult to follow (though might just be me). Keep up the good work Universita Bocconi,4
Will be useful to take the Phyton Cpurse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignments.,4
Presented content is rather clear and instructors are rather easy to follow. Only the assignments are often confusing as there are questions which refer to missing content.,4
"You can do it in one or two days.Basically, it's a bunch of tips to get your job done and be organized, keeping away some bad habits.",4
"So far a very nice course, well explained and clear enough to be followed even by non mathematicians. Well done!",4
This course was a fun one that encouraged experimentation and making a lot of images. I would say the assignments could have been more challenging though.,4
I think professor is so cute（≧∇≦）,4
Very much enjoyed the class. Articulated ideas in a clear manner allowing one to reflect and best approach problems.,4
"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: regression models, residuals, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basics; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!",4
"I love the content of the course, I would like to see the teacher Oakley more happy about herself, she does a tremendous work and she does not project that.",4
"The course was very helpful for undersatnding basic concepts in project management, with interesting and insightful use cases. The pacing is excellent, lectures are just the right length to not get you overfluded with information.",4
"informative course, although I found the assignment to be somewhat redundant and insulting to the student's intelligence. It's common sense that anyone what automatically know to make a list of survival items and an escape strategy in a disaster situation!",4
"A few last lectures (Future, Try) lack pretext, or at least appear somewhat out of order, unless one is familiar with the topic. Generally, higher score (10 out of 10, or 9 out of 10) could have been made a little harder to get. Adding a couple of extra optional problems for one point each could be a good idea.",4
"Thanks for this great course! It was very interesting and informative, and I learned a lot about e-learning.",4
"Great course. Could have been longer, if you ask me. Also there were a few technical bugs. Notifications for assignments could have been clearer too. The system said it would email me when I needed to review peer's assignments, but that never happened.",4
Very useful and scientific oriented,4
Great class!,4
It's a great course and so is the book that accompanies it. However the Course and Book titles are not entirely accurate. It should be called 'An American History of Rock'. There is relatively little discussion outside of America and this is only to serve the discussion of American rock.The book in particular would benefit from a section at the end of each chapter or sidebars 'Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic'. As music becomes more fragmented in the 70s I imagine this criticism will become more important.Another thought would be if the Course put a play list together in 'Deezer' and 'Spotify'. That would definitely 5-star the courseStill it's a great course and I really enjoyed it.,4
A brief introduction to all the need to know's about smartphones from day 1 providing enough detail for any audience. Would definetely suggest taking notes or watching again for people new to the concept. For me a good review of every smartphone technology. Thank you,4
It was really helpful and inspiring.,4
"For me this course managed to finally get me over the hurdles in really understanding what is going on in sequences and series. The course is fairly difficult, but then so is the subject matter; and the difficulties were not insurmountable. I would give it 5 stars except for a few spots where a little more explanation would have been helpful e.g., the relationship between the indices in the two forms of the Taylor series for the cosine function.",4
It is not the best of ... but actually I was available to have some positive sentence about photography. Amazing,4
The lectures were really good. I am a microbiologist and have very little background of computer programming. A more detailed course would have he,4
A great course for introduction to IoT.,4
Very good course and material. Can be downloaded and read again .,4
Gave me a great understanding of how my memory works! Very helpful!,4
"Easy to follow the lectures which are systematic and structured. Besides learning grammar, I found that the points about pronunciation were really useful which were not gone through in great detail when I attended Korean classes in language schools due to time constraint. Hope that there will be future classes of higher levels from Yonsei!",4
"Enjoyed the course. Very informative. Though Prof. Barbara is an introvert herself, her advocating face to face interactions made me rethink possibilities in my daily routine for such an experiment. Hopefully my results will be as good as the science claims. :)",4
Pretty practical course It' ll involve a good amount of programming. Not quiz and theoretical verification here.,4
I would really love to take this course as I m currently a computer science and thanks for granting me this course Yuhuuuuu!,4
This course is easy to understand how python works.,4
"Definitely recommend if you need a crash-course on Ancient Egypt! In-depth, concise, and well explained; suitable for all those interested in ancient history",4
"Overall this was a good course. It does assume some prior knowledge/experience of programming, which makes some parts of he course challenging for a newbie. However, I would recommend it to anyone beginning the R journey.",4
Nice class,4
"Course material was not difficult, but the homeworks weren't much correlated with it. If you attend other IT online courses you will notice that this one is a little old fashioned. I was also more interested in real-life usages than how it should be implemented. Regardless the cons course was informative and somehow useful.",4
This course starts off slow and gradually goes very deep into business metrics which provides a valuable view-point on the topic.,4
"Good content, and covered a lot in a short span of time",4
"A very good course for those who want to learn English composition or essay writing, or both. If you are looking for developing your writing skill, you must give it a try.",4
Good course and very nice demonstrations on Tableau.,4
This course is so well structured and the is awesome,4
"Assignments were too easy, and were really ""fed"" to us. Also, I liked better the setting in the previous course where Dr. Chuck was in his office and we always saw his screen.",4
It Feels VEry Good Learning Python from Dr.Chucks,4
Insightful and interesting journey. I had to learn new vocabulary and way of thinking but did appreciate the interesting intellectual excursion.,4
Good course. I would like it better if there are more depth in theories and analysis/examples used in lectures are more reflecting social media and the use of more cutting edge innovation in communication technology.,4
The instructors are excellent and the material is good. The only drawback is the need to use Graphlab. This would have been a really great course if we had to use open source software.,4
"I loved this course. Some criticism though is that the course doesn't go into detail on the architecture of modern day computers. Also, some things were simplified in the course, which is a little disappointing. However, I did get to build my own computer, and I learned quite a lot from this course, so it was definitely worth spending time taking the course.",4
great course really enjoy it and you can learn a lot from this.,4
"Awesome starting point for whom wants to know about ""web access using python""",4
Excellent course. I have a minor gripe that the lectures were almost verbatim repeats of the course textbook which itself was very useful. Looking forward to the next course already.,4
Good tips!,4
Little high on the scientific data,4
A wonderful course.,4
"The field has developed quickly, the course covers many classical theories in the field. I suggest those read the deep learning book www.deeplearningbook.org for reference",4
"Good course. Interesting clear lectures and interesting, enjoyable assignments.",4
"this course was good for me.prior to this course i have no idea of html,css,javascript.explanation was good..",4
Excellent course! However tough to manage all the technical terms if you're a newbie ;),4
I am finding it really interesting and helpful. :),4
some of the content and videos were too wordy and had more theory v/s examples.,4
"This is a very, very good course about databases fundamentals and design.",4
This course was amazing!!I previously had taken Python course from other university from an other website.It was very difficult and lost interest since it was first time I was dealing with python and the difficulty level was too much for a fresher to Python. But this was easy yet interesting as well :) and I am very happyThank you Charles Sir !!! :),4
"This course was informative. I especially loved the interview with Tressie from Taco Bell. I feel like I learned a lot from her. The only part I did not enjoy from this course was the Peer to Peer assignment. Don't get me wrong, the assignment was very informative. I love the concept of peer to peer assignments because I get to learn so much more in different sectors. However, socialmention.com was NOT working for me. It was very slow and I could not even load the page. I had to go to a cafe with high speed internet in order to load my keywords, hashtags, and influencers, but I couldn't until the last day (which is why I handed in my assignment late). Other than that, this course was (probably) better than the first one.",4
Course is informative and organised. I would like to sincerely thank both the professors and their team who put all this together.,4
i like this course very much....and this is my 1st course....,4
One more teacher better,4
"This course is practical.The ""Machine Learning"" learners can get training how to implement a part of AI algorithms dealing programming exercises.Harrison",4
"I would recommend this course to anyone who has some experience with coding, but has not taken an algorithm course. I particularly like this course because it is more ""math-heavy"" than some of the other courses. After taking this course, you might not be able to solve all Leetcode problems (so probably will not help with your interviews directly), but from an intellectual point of view, I think the instructor does a good job explaining why people care about algorithms and how to analyze a class of algorithms rigorously.",4
"Nice course, but too much focus on ""R"" as a tool.... Industries don't use R as much... The course must be made more generic and independent of R - understand it is not easy to do but ....",4
Great beginning to Data Science,4
Good and informative.,4
good course,4
Very good course with a level accessible without the need to be a mathematical guru. Maybe some videos are a little beat too long.,4
Very informative course!,4
I would only like this course better if it was longer and more in-depth. Excellent!,4
great course thnx,4
Very useful. I am less afraid of socialising at business events.,4
Useful introductioin,4
"Thank you, it's a good course. I only wish I could take quiz without purchase a course. I don't need a certificate but I'd like to check my knowledge. That is what quiz for.",4
Quite useful and hard,4
"A very good introduction to major branches of Philosophy. While some questions on assignments were rather vague, and some lectures rather dull (I don't think I bothered watching the videos from the third week on... just relied on the- excellently put together!- handouts). Overall, a great course to take for a beginner to the world of Philosophy :D",4
"A bit too trivial, though usefu",4
"Wonderful course. It was very well written with all major topics covered. Bonus video and Panelists Interview were also very helpful. However I would like to mention a small mistake in the week 4th's lesson, slide no. 3.23 has a network diagram, which has last activity written A instead of I. It changes the calculation for complete forward and backward pass. Also, Margaret explained the network forward and backward pass with the value of first day as 1. However in the lesson it was taken as 0, which again changes the formulas she described in the video. It's not difficult to understand the difference but it somehow breaks the harmony.",4
Excellent course. Everything concise but well explained. Nice activities and quizes.,4
"This was a good course. The lectures were a good length, they were interesting and very easy to understand. The lecturer was articulate and easy to follow. I liked the way the readings supported the course and the dognition stuff will be really useful. The citizen science material was also interesting. A useful and practical course that was fun and interesting to do.",4
I find the course material at Coursera all very good. What is lacking is the peer review system. I understand that there is no way they could offer these courses at these prices. It is however the only reservation I have.,4
Good and clear explanations. At the end it became more difficult since filosophie was involved which for me opened my ey. Some 'slides' are old fashioned.,4
"Much more useful than the first course. It was very interesting to see that methodology has a different approaach according to the purpose of the class that is not necessarily communication. Great experience Although I think that the questions for peer revision are so general aand vague that one is almost forced to give a good grade even if the assignment is just a re-telling of what was presented on the video, sometimes even word by word.",4
"The course goes a long way in proving what it sets out to prove. However, it would have been good to hear from some people (I am sure they exist) who dispute the stipulated thesis that modern psychology confirms that accuracy of the Buddhist analysis of the human mind.",4
Fun course to take. Sometimes a little bit overexplaining obvious things (due to this it's often convenient to watch videos with 1.5x-2.0x speeds) and hiding quite a great amount of math. Even though it doesn't fulfill all my requirements and demands (that is explaining the nature of method/algorithm and it's derivation) I definitely can understand teacher's focusing on the practical side of the subject.,4
Good one,4
The content was good and very instructive but the videos and graphic material could be more dynamic and interactive.,4
Auto-grading would have been a better option in this course.,4
"Great lectures with clear explanations and illustrations. Well chosen readings. Extremely interesting topics. Some of the quiz questions were ambiguous, particularly ones that asked students to pick the quotes that best represent a particular idea.",4
A very informative course.,4
Good videos well presented. Good intro into data viz and Tableau,4
"it will be better if there is some form of text or readings that can be shared in the course.When speaking of the examples during the lecture, I wish there is a real video of the experience rather than just the prof speaking of it. I wish I could have my own understanding in responding to those experiences. However, overall I learnt a lot through out the courses, it is really easy to understand, and usually I watch the videos when I want to take a break from whatever I was doing.",4
"I think this is very useful for introductory, but it lacks some references for who wants go deeper.",4
"I liked the course. As with the previous three courses, Dr. Severance does a great job presenting the material and explaining how the code works. I felt that the assignments and the book were lacking a little bit:1. The textbook needs to be updated to include the Object Oriented Programming section that is covered in Week 1.2. There is no programming exercise for the OOP section, just a quiz.3. There are no assignments in the textbook for Chapters 14 and 15. The examples of the code and how it works is awesome, though, which is a trade off of sorts.4. The Chapter 14 programming assignments only require minimal programming in Python and/or SQL. I would have liked to do a little more programming.5. Chapter 15 felt like it was shoved in at the end, and the assignment was really easy. I was hoping for a little more rigor on that one, also.Overall, it was a good experience and I'm looking forward to finishing up this specialization when the Capstone is unlocked and becomes available.",4
Learned a lot through the course. Will recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how to be effective in social media,4
"Great for beginners, the basics are well explained.",4
"Excellent, I learned alot",4
"the course is pretty good, but the present of the teacher at the moment of corrections is needed",4
"A great course. I learned a new perspective about negotiation, now I'll continue to making my road. Thanks",4
"Nice course, perhaps a little bit too little effort required but that suited my schedule at this point.",4
"It was very helpful to take this course as it gave me an insight to understand and look closely at the indications which will guide me in the future to deal with children who are normally labelled as 'slow', 'not focused', 'has lack of concentration' etc. The course gives a detailed understanding towards the psychological aspects and directs teachers to engage and encourage such children.I sure feel more equipped to handle such scenarios in the future. Would appreciate if more videos of real classroom training can be added! All the best!",4
"Very interesting course. But, so fast. I think it could cover more tools.",4
"Assignments are good-intended, but I am not sure how helpful they are, as they are really boring and unnecessarily time-consuming. I do not know how could one make them better. In contrast, the videos are really good, they are worth your time even if you know your way around these things.",4
"The course is very good and the instructors are very communicative! The extra material is also very good, you have the chance to listen to so many compositions, which is very important in order to understand the touch of quartets. Personally, I would like to have some more advanced lectures and to be provided with the music sheets of the great composers in order to analyse them and learn from them! If Curtis is planning to organise a more advanced course, I would definitely join!",4
"This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning. It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course. I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor. Don't let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent. For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization, I should warn that this one is much more difficult, particularly for those without prior teaching experience, and far more practically based.",4
It will be nice to add some more extra exercises with a complete guide in the wiki section.,4
there are a couple misptints,4
"I really enjoyed this course. The videos are really informative, yet entertaining.",4
Very detailed in each step.,4
"The lessons are valuable. My issue is that when I passed the quiz, I was unsure which 2 I got wrong and wanted to know for my own information.Thank you",4
"A very rebellious upstream swim against natural selection and the Buddhist Neo's heroic effort to Nibbana! Drawing parallels to evolutionary and social psychology, Robert Wright takes you in an inward journey that brings to clear focus the origin of suffering and the prescriptive teachings of Gautama the Buddha to overcome suffering by embracing your true self. If you are looking for personal mastery, this is for you. If you have intense cravings, this is for you. If you are afflicted with compulsive behaviors, this is for you. If you are thinking ""what the heck is all this"", trust me, this course is for you.",4
A good starting point for new or future managers.,4
good course and good teaching. But the problem is when explaining about unity software the letter are so small in tutorial to follow,4
"Great intro to polymorphism, casting classes, sorting and datastructures",4
"The course content is very relevant and useful. I would like to suggest to include overview of more MSW management options. e.g. Refuse Derived Fuel, etc.",4
"Excellent contents, but relator's english is pretty bad. :-)",4
Thank you,4
"It's an excellent course from University of California, Irvine.I would appreciate the course curriculum designers and faculty who have delivered the course through examples and case studies.Looking forward for the more informative courses like this.Regards,Hemendar PusaProfessional Social worker and Special EducatorIndia",4
Lots of information. I learned quite a lot. It was a nice and informative introduction to Data Science in all aspects technically and theoretically.,4
Only problem was the large gap between the assignments and lectures. Swirl exercises should not be optional as they are the most helpful part of the course.,4
Excellent course for learning the very basics of Python. The class was well organized and easy to understand. I liked the exercises. They were a bit challenging in the end. My only negative thing to say is that I hope they are able to update the time it takes to grade assignments on the server. I can't wait to take the next course!,4
One of the better online courses I have used.,4
"The course content is very good and is must have if you missed that stuff in colledge. It teaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient, gives some examples of cool techniques and provides challenges to apply those techniques.However, there are things that I hate about this course. First of all this is about forums. They are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session. Staff provides exactly zero help. If you are stuck, you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignments are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isn't it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with. Now I am glad I did that because now I am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else first.Anyway, the creators of the course have done a great job, which is highly appreciated. I believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues I pointed above.",4
"I decided not to submit any exercises but I did really like the presentation, the faculty and the information. Would recommend. Thank you!",4
Excellent series of courses. Wish I had done a specialization and had more time to do a better job.Perhaps I will do the Capstone project.,4
"More in-depth work with ArcMap and associated principles. Redundant to a degree with the intro to the specialization, but good blend of instruction and assignments.",4
Thank you so much. Great effort. If the videos can be shorter and focus more on the tools that would be great.,4
Excellently put together.Little trouble with the Matlab licensing duration though.,4
"I really liked the course. A few adjustments are in place, but it was nice to have the feedback and the attention from the teachers and Coursera community.",4
"The class started with great instruction and was easy to follow. Coming into week 4, the class sped up really quick and became a lot more difficult to manage.",4
"While being super intuitive, the course is too easy even for beginners,The lectures are coherent and smooth, assignment could be slightly more difficult.",4
"The course was interesting and good. The instructors were engaged. It just missed something. Maybe it could be sort of ""fresher"".",4
Great course so far. More examples would have been great,4
It was great to see how does it work in real life. I wish there was more example and more challenging scenarios. I did enjoy it.,4
"Very well structured, content well explained and extremely relevant for someone starting Project Management.",4
"Very helpful, very professional staff and content.",4
"Very well presented course, but in my view could be somewhat more to the point. Nevertheless, congratulations for a job well done.",4
Knowledgeableble information covered under the topic.,4
"As Professor Shiller had said, this course is the shortened version of Financial Markets (2011), which he taught in Yale. A shortened one as it is, I benefit a lot from the course. Terms are explained explicitly. Unfortunately, videos in week 3 is not complete, so I had to go to Open Yale for more info. If you want more info, more materials and more homework, you can go for Open Yale. Materials are more detailed there. Despite the inconvenience, I think this course is very suitable for peoples like me, a beginner in finance. I quite recommend this course. A better one if the error can be solved.",4
"Not bad overall. Some very useful tools, although I confess I found a lot of the delivery to be very dry...sorry! Best of all is the ongoing weekly email which continues to throw up new sources of info. Many thanks.",4
"Good overall beginner course but definitely for the beginners. Only the last week may be interesting to people that already know a bit about HTML and CSS, as the JavaScript part at the end has some interesting assignments; like hiding an image in another image.",4
Thanks to Duke university for offering these professional courses free,4
Could have been good if there is a practical assignment.,4
"At first the course is hands on, later on it becomes more of theory. This would have been a challenging course if we had more harder graph problems to solve though.",4
Barbara Oakley has a very nice voice to listen to and she explains thiings very well. It is an addicting course which makes your more curious and willing to learn more and more!,4
I wanted to get an understanding of the fundamentals of html and this was a great course. It doesn't babysit you so you have to get interactive with the coding to actually learn it.,4
very good and interesting module which help me relate to line of work,4
Excellent but need more challenging questions both in theory and programming part.,4
Helpful also for experienced HTML students,4
"The sound can be a bit low, but everything else was great",4
very useful!,4
Great. Really informative,4
Really clear but it's a pity that there is nowhere a free possibility to gain certificates... :(,4
Thank you. I learned a lot from the course!,4
"Structured course with very good information, but sometimes it felt superficial. I know 4 weeks is very short time to fulfill tons of topics on this course, but i think you can push students a bit more.",4
a little too short but good,4
"Very interesting course, good starting point to get deeper into cyber security as a field!",4
"Very objective, theoretical and empirical point of view of terrorism. Very clear explanations and very interesting lectures added about the subject. Very recommendable",4
"Concise, simple and well structured practical course to easily learn HTML, CSS & JS for web development",4
Enjoyed this class.,4
"Helps install and set up the necessary software, but does require you to do bit of searching on the web to completely understand certain aspects of the course.",4
"Nice course, but too many unnecessary words around the necessary core of the course. And I don't want to Tweet all that Tweets.",4
Great course to get you started with web scraping.,4
"A lot of useful and practical advices and information about learning. Definitely worth the time you'll put in it. Really enjoyed some of the tips applied in the video (powerful pictures used like zombie, mental palace etc) Some of the technical/bio video should use more of that model to explain the concept. Not sure I can quote properly any of the scientific concept that was explained.",4
I really enjoy practicing with this course. It contains clear explanations and a good variety of practice exercises.,4
"very good course, python had very much significance in today's world.Thank You all.",4
Great.,4
"Solid class, enjoyable and well suited for beginners.",4
"unnecessary, excessive and distracting time expent on the difference between pali and sanskrit.",4
many mistakes in the exercise solutions,4
I learned a lot about the under pinning of the internet and how various things worked together on it.,4
"This course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. My two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week. This is very strange. The test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before.",4
A very fascinating and enjoyable course! I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take the first step in learning about cybersecurity.,4
Thanks a lot!Please keep up the good work.,4
"I thoroughly enjoyed the class. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because, I would have liked to have seen one of the design projects reviewed by the teacher or a teacher's assistant. I appreciate the peer review, but hearing from someone with experience can be very reassuring.",4
Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning.,4
"Good course, especially the doc and unit testing parts. I had hoped for a more advanced implementations, but thank you for mentioning the exec function.",4
The course was interesting and low maintenance. The lectures could have been snappier and more to the point.,4
"This course covers a lot of material, but unfortunately lacks depth and thorough examples in many areas. It could also use more hands-on activities. Overall, I learned quite a bit and found it was worth the time and effort.",4
"This was a great course as an introduction to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Hopefully it is followed up with a more technical course. The only thing I don't care for with FHIR is they pronounce it 'Fire' which smacks of cheesy marketing. Nonetheless, the course is worth it, and the instructor is very clear and thorough.",4
It is a good course for starters.,4
"easy for new learners, but practical and meaningful!",4
"Overall good quality course, interesting and relevant. The only drawback are the quizzes because sometimes the answer is not clear, even after watching carefully the video and reading material.",4
I love the lectures! Challenging and rigorous.,4
The Course is very well structured and easy to grasp.,4
Loved the Tableau section and the instructor is a good communicator. It'd be great to have a whole course about this BI Software,4
"A lot of the assessments for the ""history"" section of the course are needless factual-item recall, and not very cognitively challenging or engaging. The combination of history/technology/security could be more tightly integrated, it feels like three discrete courses just merged together into one. Good material overall, just not sure the scale/scope is appropriate to one course.",4
I feel this is a great start to a wonderful program that you all have provided . However o wish there was a way to share code to help optimize the many many errors I had made beforehand. Thank you for the opportunity.,4
Very interesting course. It pays to have some control theory and matlab background,4
I can understand the concept in a better way....I really enjoyed this.,4
Great course. I like a lot.,4
Good one,4
Very useful and learnt lot of important concepts.,4
Simple and yet informative.,4
"it's nicely designed, but it would be great if the course designers have their input in evaluating our projects and most importantly updating the material to the latest swift version as this is the whole purpose of why one would register in this course.",4
"Not enough teaching from the professors , just presentation slides. Which kind of reduced the human component of learning.",4
Enjoy the course,4
"It is conceptual compared to other courses, however it brings a lot in increasing our self-awareness. Very much appreciated.",4
nice course to understand the history from a different view!,4
Very interesting look at the financial markets and institutions. It is particularly clear and well-explained for non-native speakers of Russian.,4
"The courses are easy to understand, however, they are poorly designed to work on an iPad. Also, page references for electronic books are useless. It is sometimes difficult to find the reading material in a particular book because the electronic version does not show pages.",4
One of the best machine learning courses i have enrolled for,4
A good course. Although within this University of Michigan specialization there are ones that I found more captivating so check out the whole specialization.,4
"I had forgotten how much reading there is! I didn't have a lot of time, but I enjoyed the lectures a lot and it revisited my interest in history and ancient civilizations. I think I learned more from this than the Ancient Civ class I took many years ago in college! Most enjoyable!",4
"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Spark (especially YARN mode), explaining Spark Jobs, Stages & Tasks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!",4
I think there is something not so important but occupys a large part of this class. Maybe you can rebalance the priority of this the contents in this class and replenish some introductions of more useful functions.,4
A good course to revise the concepts of capturing software requirements learned during a software engineering bachelors and to gather some of the newer techniques used in the industry such as use of user stories.,4
Very interesting!!!!,4
"Great classes, but I do believe some of the concepts are a little scattered, the way you present them could be a little more organized so we get a better understanding.",4
Great instructors...very well done!,4
Good course. My only negative remark is that I really missed the swirl exercises that were available for the other courses of this specialization.,4
"I would like to have direct feedback instead of just reviews like: "" review your tenses, or review your grammar"" I mean, I would like to know exactly where is my mistake, and how to correct it.Good course, I really learned to much about the tenses.",4
In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and coursera.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera,4
"Decent intro, though it would be a lot more useful if the professor didn't use his Software and instead thought us implementations using python/R which are used in most commercial applciations",4
"Enjoyed the class, Game Theory has always been interesting to me.",4
Very Informative on the basics,4
"A lot of complaints about the final project for this course. To be fair, the course content wasn't directly relevant to the final project. However, there were parts of the course that communicated saved workflows, how to import, etc. In order to identify how to do what was asked I found an example workflow that could be imported. I also found an example history that allowed me to read through the approach and then complete myself. I was honest in turning in the assignment that it was based on an imported workflow. There is a big part of community and reproducible research to the Galaxy tools and I had no issue completing the project.",4
"Very good course, the content is great and well organized. The slides with code are a bit of an embarrassment for the University of California. The code is presented on what looks like a power point slide with bullets so the formatting and alignment is totally messed up, and then there are no shortage of typo's and code errors. But, the material is very good and Ira Pohl does an excellent job presenting it.All in all a great course and exactly what I was looking for.",4
very nice coaching by chuck,4
I would be a useful if this course teaches about the existing models present in Matlab/octave and not writing rigorous codes every time for analyzing data.,4
"Overall I really enjoyed this course, and I think I learned a lot, so thank you!However I think there were some things that could be improved.Firstly the quality of the code provided for the programming assignment was very low. It contains a lot of things that are far from modern c++ best-practices (e.g. using raw arrays instead of std::vector, mixing malloc and new, using new where there is no reason to use it, using raw pointers when references would be fine, missing consts, macros, ...). There were also some relatively minor bugs: the first log message doesn't print with the correct prefix, and the grading script as provided doesn't run (IIRC it was because the #! isn't on the first line). Since this course could be some people's first introduction to C++ I feel that it's important to set a good example, and to keep the code simple and safe.Secondly the symbols used for things were often inconsistent between slides, which was occasionally confusing but should be easy to fix.Despite these issues I still think this is a great course, it just could be a little bit better.",4
"The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on.So overal the course was very good, but negative was that the course was a bit too long, I understand Coursera needs to finance the course, so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees. Bu the extra review rounds felt redundant, and because the course was so long it was difficult to keep focussed on it.",4
"This is a great introductory course which lets anyone learn the layers, management styles and agreements that all have to work together in order to provide an effective and concise Infrastructure model.",4
Very interactive and extremely helpful.,4
This course is great.,4
Excellent course. It gives me an insight history and views from how images have evolved from flim to digital eras.,4
"I really enjoyed this course but week 9 was extremely ridiculous. I had a hard time relating the examples to the quiz and, when i finally figured it out, the answers were huge and complex numbers. Other then that though, i do recommend this course.",4
greatly simplified and practical course.Thankyou Dr.Chuck,4
very helpful,4
Good course...very good basic exposure,4
I really do think that the information taught in this course will be useful.,4
I really liked this course. I just wish there was more documentation on insect reproduction. Other than that really good!,4
"well structured, fits well to beginners!",4
"this course overall is great. the content needs to be more in depth and give more compact information in each session. also need to give more detail why we should do certain step instead of just tell how to do.the course offer resources, and this aids with further self-pace learning, which is helpful. the ppt resource could cover more content in detail.overall it is a good course.",4
Challenging and great!,4
Great it was,4
"Excellent course ,gives great insights of life and how to being happy.",4
Great introductory course to understand citites as sources of solutions instead of sources of problems.,4
Some times i felt lack of explanation. Because there is a lot of math. And quizzes are too big (10 + 32 questions on Week 7). But overall i would say that this course is the only one to which i will definetly come back,4
"A very insightful introductory course that introduce us to a broad range of financial instruments, history as well as discussion on some recent crisis.",4
"Luc de Brabandiere is a highly passionate, motivating speaker, who brought me new perspectives on my job and everyday perceptions.",4
"Course is great, it might be helpful in negotiations at every aspect of life. It also shed the light onto aspects of different laws and contract rules. Still, the final grade is a bit complex taking into account the previous ones are light.",4
"The course is a great intro to excel, but there are some errors in a few of the data examples (good practice data cleansing!)",4
Enjoyed learning Python from Chuck,4
"It's a wonderful course! The only problem is the course uses an older version of python and I can't practice the problems on my latest text wrangler or pycharm. Still, everything else is perfect.",4
It was a great experience.,4
"Was pretty good overall. I feel there was a lack of in-lecture questions in the first few videos. That aside, great course.",4
Very Good starting place for a thorough introduction to all aspects of Financial Markets.,4
Great step-by-step introduction to Chinese Characters! Filled with historical background to help understand the underlying meaning of the characters and not just the image.It would be nice to have a complete vocabulary for the whole class that we can download and use!,4
"I wish I could see actual budgeting process. Will be very useful to see how to get the gross, net gross, and average revenue of the projects in different areas...",4
"The lectures are very good. But the Discussion forum became a ""hidden question - mistic answer"" panel lately. Could we get some non-scored assignments to discuss them openly with mentors and to learn more ?",4
FUN AND INTERESTING COURSE BUT I FOUND THE INSTRUCTIONS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO UNDERSTAND AND THE ASSIGNMENTS BLOCKED BY COMPUTER DIFFICULTIES.,4
Good overview of the topic. Inspiring lecturer. No need for any complicated math. Having a background in physics on advanced high school level should probably be enoughto pass this course.,4
Great course to learn the nuts and bolts of Data Science.,4
"Well structured! In the HTML version of the book are some type errors (escaped characters), please correct them to help others. Thanks!",4
Good course with the overview of different machine learning techniques,4
"I'd pick 3.7 or so, really. The applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action. Without it, it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the SAS programming for free from SAS itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online (in fact potential students may consider taking the SAS programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the SAS coding framework that comes in handy for this class).",4
"For someone who is a Biologist and has heard about microbiome before, this course is more a review than a course where everything is new. However, hat doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. The course was entertaning, well explained, and interesting. The interviews were simply great, with the opportunity to see experts explaining concepts and projects. For someone with less background than mentioned, it is a very nice course to do. It will change your point of view regarding microorganisms.",4
I saw some new things.,4
"It covers some basics, but doesn't go deep into anything. Definitely take the other courses in the specialization to go deeper.",4
"Quizzes in the lecture videos would be nice. Also more, but shorter videos would be enjoyable. Programming assignments very nice!",4
"Very good course, going through plenty of used regression techniques.",4
"Nice Course.However, it will better to have the slides. It is hard to review a specific concept with videos.",4
Personally very fulfilling. Learnt all the basic stuff I needed to know.,4
"This course was quick, easy and fun, plus giving best practice pointers. Thanks!",4
"Good teacher, simple learning, maybe too basic, mostly with CSS",4
"Very comprehensive course on introduction to database. This is an advanced course so you should have some experience with DBs before taking it. The lecturer, Mr. Mannino, delivers a dry, straightforward teaching style. There are plenty of materials but unfortunately, there is little interaction in the forums from the teacher himself.",4
"The content shown in the video lectures is a very nice overview of the subject but it feels somehow superficial, some more depth would be really appreciated.",4
I enjoyed the time spent on the specialization and felt that the lesson exercises provided some use towards helping students develop their understanding of the craft. My only real criticism about the specialization is that I feel the curriculum could be a little more intensive. Keeping most assignments limited to a 500 word maximum is very constricting. I wish there were more meatier assignments to tackle building up to the capstone.,4
Very useful and well taught course. Assignments could be more practical though.,4
"there is a lot of Errors in your words and you correct it by Messages but it make a lot of destrbution for us , You are very quickly please be little slow when you speake , we need more Examples and please mention for us before the module what module we should revice in your courses or out before go ahead on it.",4
Amazing course!,4
Many MCQ in the quiz were out of the course we studied.,4
"A comprehensive introduction to the subject, somewhat spoiled by the unrelenting reiteration of the most basics concepts in the earlier parts of the course. A bit of a pity, since the lecturer is a fairly engaging speaker when he is not busy interrupting the flow of his argument with mind–numbing repetition.",4
"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positives: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignments have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivated, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course.",4
"The course provides an in-depth immersion into the worlds of photography. Beyond the genuine interest of the different courses, the learning process itself is well thought with a good gradation and the ability to deep dive into a theme thanks to the complementary material proposed.",4
"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R.Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning.But at least, learned a lot.",4
I thought the class was very well done as an introductory class. Although I thought there would be an introduction to characters also. I liked the laoshi and the slides. :),4
"very good, but i think more suggested materials are needed.",4
"The course offers clear explanations and is very well structured.. We do not get lost into technicalities, the material is straight to the point. Moreover, the videos are of great quality which makes the learning even more easy.A little disappointed by the finance approach though, which is too simple and makes very rough assumptions.One last point (and I cannot emphasize this enough) : the propose Simulator is a great learning tool.",4
"Are you ever tired of long-winded professors, focusing on a lecture for an hour or more, or spending hundreds of dollars for a class? Well, this course gives you the structure of a course, but the video lectures are concise, the topic is to get you in the door for data science, and all of my questions were answered quickly. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn data science.",4
"I think it's a good way to introduce the world of ""accounting"" but I think videos need to be more specific and I would have appreciated if there was some practical exercise and not only quiz! But all the informations are exposed clearly.",4
Such a good course!,4
"After completing this course you'll have a good idea on how professional PMs schedule and budget complex projects. It will also teach you some valuable techniques that can be applied to projects you may be handling in your own work. I was unfortunately not impressed by the fact that the final exam was quite simple, simply borrowing questions already asked during the lesson quizzes.",4
"Very comprehensive, staight through concepts of F&B Management.The speaker of the lecture explains very well and the interviews really interesting.Looking forward for new courses related to business management.",4
I liked this MOOC very much. I have learnt about new concepts about science and philosophy. I strongly this MOOC to students and working people interested about philosophy and science.,4
"Great course. I wish the prereqs would specify graphs, inductive proofs and other prerequsites from the math domain that were required to understand the examples.Switching to FP and recursive thinking is hard enough as it is - having to combine it with graph algorithms and other concepts, not necessarily familiar for OOP background programmers increases the effort unnecessarily. That being said, good thing the course offered a preview week.",4
Amazing course by Prof.Robert,4
"I liked this course and the professor was good, just wished they gave an extra week.",4
Follow up to Arduino Platform and the C programming language.,4
Great course,4
"Great, concise course with some very solid and well-founded recommendations on how to improve your studying and acquisition of new subjects. Also great advice on test-taking techniques.The introduction to memory techniques is very light, but it really is a really rich and detailed subject in itself so it's understandable that they didn't dive too deep. Some recommendations for additional learning for memory and advanced reading techniques would be a valuable addition to the course though.Overall I highly recommend this course. Barbara is an excellent and very likable instructor and the lessons and learnings are well-sourced and easy to follow. I'm already using the techniques and seeing good results.",4
The optional videos are not allotted enough time. Those concepts are difficult to grasp.,4
"very clear content , easy to follow and understand . first step in the word of javascriptthank you so much",4
It's boring but a necessary step to mastering Python.,4
"Great content, great slides, good examples.However, even though Dr. Ng takes time to explain the fundamental concepts and length and repeats multiple times, when it comes to complex topics, he glances over them. I ended up referring to external (Dr. Hinton, for instance) for deeper understanding.",4
Well i am surprised that Angularjs is not easy to learn but how easily and smartly you teach this course.. Really appreciated Sir!!,4
"I loved this course, even though (for me), some things were quite repetitive and unnecessarily lengthy.",4
"This is an awesome Course. I'd like that the failed tests, of the submitted programs, to be shown, in order to have a better idea where you are doing wrong.",4
"Interesting learning more about ggplot and base plotting system, as well as clustering techniques.",4
Very eay to follow and an excellent profesor,4
A good courser specialization for starter!,4
I learned some stuff and this was one of the easier courses I have taken.,4
Everybody who loves animals and who wants to understand better his/her pet should take this course. When you discover all your dog's potential you will be a better owner and a better person.,4
The course was fantastic. It was very challenging. I could do with some additional opportunities for exploratory analysis to reinforce some concepts.,4
"I learned a lot of the basics in R with this course.Sometimes it is a bit of a dissonance between the lessons and the assignments, and the programming style in the lessons might seem a bit old fashioned or cumbersome, but for good reason. There are a lot of packages in R than makes you do things easy, but knowing the base is very important. The practical assignments are challenging and fun. The video lessons are good. A big minus for misleading/unclear descriptions on how to deliver your assignments. A big plus for the peer review process.",4
I enjoyed this course very much. I rate 4/5 because I would liked a broader explanation on how to translate Stock and Flow Diagrams to mathematical models.,4
I learned a lot in this course and it was sufficiently challenging. My only qualm was that some of the pseudo-code was hard to understand and slightly misleading.,4
I enjoyed this course and feel like I've learned a lot about the history of SEO. Ms. May did a great job with the presentations and her explanations were clear and concise. I found myself bookmarking and saving many of the links she shared as resources.,4
very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jQuery,4
Excellent course; some parts were difficult some parts were not. A go,4
For beginners this is a good course to start with. I don't recommend this course for experienced programmers.,4
"The content of this course is not terribly difficult, I thought, but it's a very good introduction into most aspects of Data Science. You learn to familiarize yourself with R quite well and get a lot of independence to create a final project based on a huge data set. One thing I would've liked is a sample completed project, start to finish, to see what was expected- the things that got produced (which you peer review) varied hugely in quality.",4
"It is very US oriented, Which is not necessarily a negative aspect, but please mention that in the course structure more clearly. Although Professor Warburg is very inspiring, the optimistic attitude towards policy leaders is what I think is needed for the younger generation who get sidelined by politics and not policy. It was quite rewarding. Thankyou.",4
Not too difficult,4
"Classes were entertaining, but sometimes a little messy.",4
"I learned so much from this course. It was probably the first course where I actively and deliberately tried to follow steps of new information as I learned it. So very helpful and simple when broken down to digestible methods, techniques and language. Thank you professors for such a useful and interesting course! I will constantly review this information over and over again. ""Practice makes permanent.""",4
It the One of the Best course in HTML CSS and JavaScriptExcise is fun and the assignment is totally challenging.I recommend this course.Just go for it.,4
"Great course, but there is a problem with 2 of the exams not accepting correct answers.",4
Good course but I think it needs more Javascript materials.,4
Thank you. This was a great short form course. Quickly got to what I needed.,4
Kind of difficult,4
"The material is very, very good!I am not very confortable with the professor as a lecturer, though. He is very distractig. At the end I opted for just reading the transcripts instead of watching the videos.It is slightly annoying that the References are not properly quoted sometimes.",4
"The course is well designed and well presented. I wished for a bit more material on CSS and JavaScript. Perhaps, due to time constraints, there could be a separate course for looking at CSS and JavaScript at a more in-depth level.",4
"it is great for citizens students, However, the speaker uses such a little hard vocabulary to understand for international students as me. I really enjoy in this course. Thanks.",4
Great...job...Really heplful..,4
Superb!! I love the lessons :),4
"Very good introduction to game engines, in particular to Unity 3D. There are several projects that provide hand on experience. The only negative side is that the first 2 weeks provide very little material whereas most of the work is concentrated on the last 2 weeks.Overall this is good experience for anyone interested in learning about the subject.",4
"Excellent course in general, and I learned a lot of new data structures that one doesn't generally learn about in standard algorithms and data structures courses, like disjoint sets and splay trees.Only complaint is that sometimes the problems are too complicated for how easy they are. By this I mean that the problem statement is very long and elaborate, when what they are really asking is something trivial that can be programmed in a few lines, but it takes a while to understand just what they are asking.",4
Good introduction class.,4
"Excellent course. It is probably less structured, than the University of Michigan course (by professor Siedel), but contains a few breakthrough insights that the Michigan course lacks - eg a more defined concept of a pie; a more structured approach to dividing this pie; the principle of ""never say no to a proposal, make the other side say no to your proposal instead"" etc.",4
"The stepik interactive text was just amazing !! I think it is a great way to teach. Integrating with Code Academy to learn Python was really helpful. I spent quite a bit of time on a few challenges. However, arriving at the solution was very rewarding. As a biologist, it is a good start for first time exposure to bioinformatics and algorithms. There were some concepts I had to read multiple times to understand. Some detailed explanations by earlier students were helpful in a few cases.",4
Useful information for anyone who talks or writes.,4
I am satisfied with the course content. It gave me a great opportunity to learn programs and also a great step forward in web programming.,4
This is an excellent course however I wish the answer sheets of the quiz be shared once the deadline has passed.,4
very helpful,4
Good intro,4
Well structured content and great explanation on concepts. I really like the concept challenge portion as it helps dig into the application of the concepts explained in the lecture. It would have been better if the lecture slides were available in pdfs.,4
"The course covers a great deal of content, which is very relevant to day to day business context.However, the course instructors can certainly do a better job on providing clear instructions on Projects and phrasing of Quiz questions. Some of the phrasing of questions/deliverables can be confusing and often requires rigorous deciphering.",4
"This course has made me more thoughtful and analytical, about things I did not really look at previously. Plus I learned to use Twine, it is a great tool.",4
I loved the course and I want to take the othe,4
Very fundamental and solid introduction to basic optics.,4
A really good introduction to Quantitative Models. I will personally recommend it for beginners since it wraps up main concepts.,4
Videos explain very well all the contents.,4
Nice introductory course. Very clear ans structured!,4
"After taking this course, I know what the Nutrition Facts of food means and what type of food is good for health.",4
The course is good but is not focused on scala features. It is more generic parallel programming approach.,4
"The course is great so far. However, i'm facing technical issues with the auto-grader and with using the phython tool online.",4
"I cannot understand what the teacher says because of the accent, in the first time I thought it's not a problem but actually I was.",4
the outline of this program seems good,4
Some great material and I learned a lot. I did in fact complete the course but chose not to submit written material. Sometimes the lecturer was perhaps a little dry.,4
"This course was very nice, its objectives were clear and it gave a good panorama of the writing experience. The interviews with writers were interesting and some tips about editing and publishing were really valuable.",4
"Course content was excellent, and very interesting. The presentation could be improved however; at times I found it hard to hear what was being said due to poor sound quality. Nevertheless the course has served as an excellent introduction to Chinese culture and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about it.",4
Good Course. Would've been great if important urgent quadrants were also covered.,4
Very helpful course in understanding basics of internet and website design.,4
Course Material Was Quite Informative,4
"Does a fine job of discussing the U.S. healthcare system. Further, did a fine job of explaining the potential of FHIR for the U.S. healthcare system.",4
"This is a great course for beginners . If you can spend more time after the second week, you will get best out of the course .",4
Great Course!,4
Quite interesting with lots to learn.,4
The tutor is exceptionally good. It included all the sources for documentation but I felt I learned more from by reading the Angularjs official documentation than from this course. Assignments covered a variety of concepts.,4
nice review in TCP/IP,4
"Very nice course, it varies a lot with the content so many different angles are mentioned.",4
THANK YOU!,4
Great introduction to Digital Marketing. I was able to obtain great insights on how the digital world impacts Marketing and consumer behavior.,4
"Informative course, very well organized, and very useful tools & strategies presented in the course. The presentations are a bit deadpan, and the assignments aren't overly helpful (only quizzes), but the content is good.",4
Good course. Few things towards the end of course were not quite clear to me.,4
"Simple, short, to the point, some extra links would be more helpful",4
Great Course.I am not giving 5 stars because we didn't get the assignment to actually implement LDA algorithm and Complete Hierarchical algorithm.May be I am little biased because 5th course is not yet available.Please make 5th course available.Topics that need to be covered in 5th course are very import for implementing all these algorithms at lower dimensions.,4
"Although more about Prob and Stat than learning to use Excel, concepts of binary classification and entropy are very interesting and are taught very deliberately and thoroughly. More practise quizes and worked out examples would be even better.",4
I really like this course. I will recommend this to all beginners.,4
"This course was really helpful in understanding the basics of Mandarin and gave me a little more insight into the Chinese culture and mode of thinking. Chinese no longer looks like an impossible language to understand. Love it! Would love to have a few more printable notes, though.",4
pretty basic course,4
good for fresh programmer,4
Great approach to the course!,4
"Although the course is designed in a simple way ,we still need to have some prior knowledge in mathematics used in the course to understand it.",4
Good tips provided to make sure nothing has been forgotten in your research process.,4
Good Introductory course for JavaScript.!,4
Excellent...Prof Javier is good. Concepts really well explained and as simple as possible ways !,4
"Great course for sports coaches, PE teachers and anyone interested to pursue a career in sports.",4
Muy instructivo,4
This course is the best for people who are interested in pursuing or continuing their tertiary education in Japan. I highly recommend to people who suited above seek to join this course as the course will give you a better understanding on Japanese university structure.,4
"There are too much materials for each week for a Hong Kong secondary school (middle school) student. The speed can be adjusted to a slower one, so as to allow more people to catch up the course.",4
Good hands on course. The self built amplifier circuit feels like a hack but works around the voltage level issues adequately without the mezzanine board which was not available at the time the course was prepared.,4
"It is too short course and this module is very basic and short , so much more to talk about JS but instructor is good.",4
This course content is very good! but i got stuck sometimes because some program installation is very annoying(ex... bower...).,4
"It is a bit complex, maybe it would be more feasible with more dynamic or visualizing resorces",4
"This course enables you to have basic knowledge into the what we call the internet, how it started, what technologies, protocols and how much research work has gone into the internet. also gives you an insight into the security aspect of the web which i believe every learned person should know.",4
Loved the brief lectures and well structured layout. Definitely a must for those stepping into this wonderful area of multidisciplinary research!,4
"R Programming in Coursera is a great course. You will learn a lot about R and a lot about advanced programming. But you will suffer along the way. Every lesson brings tons of knowledge, and every quiz will leave you with the feeling you only knew half of what was needed. You will have to fill in the blanks, which is easier if you have previous knowledge of R and/or have previous coding know-how. From someone who had taken other R programming courses, I loved and hated this one at the same time. It's a great way to really learn R, but be ready to put the additional hours and reading required to successfully pass.",4
Excellent course for brushing the fundamentals. The assignments also shows how the fundamentals are related to the big scheme of things.,4
"Not as evenly paced as the first two courses. Also some material was covered at a very high level, whilst I found that some explanations did not immediately build on my understanding gained through the foundation course, but rather confused it. Still a worthwhile course nonetheless. I look forward to the rest in the specialisation.",4
The course goes through all of the required topics within material science and gives proper information.Professor's explanation and his description makes it easy to understand.Thank You,4
"This course is perfect for really newbie. However, it also answers the question of ""What is Data Science?""",4
concept clearing and building strong enough!,4
"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
"The lectures made me reevaluate what I considered ""studying"" and explained how I can trick my brain in to being more efficient at taking in information. The last week contains some good test taking advice and motivation. Highly recommend this class!",4
"This is a very clear and very well presented course. It covers the science of nutrition as well as the practical aspects of cooking through demos. The instructor speaks clearly and knowledgeably about her subject.I will note that it is definitely a beginner level course. If you already do a fair bit of cooking from scratch and have already read some Michael Pollan books, you may not learn much that is new to you.What it does though, it does very well.Also, the instructor's kitchen is beautiful and I spent most of the lectures coveting it greatly :)",4
Great course!,4
Data Analysis and the technicalities of getting to the right results and presenting them in a meaningful way,4
good information.,4
Very good starting point. Great for beginners to get a grasp of the idea of each language.,4
Excellent course. It makes you analyze yourself own thoughts and ideas about violence.,4
"Good overview of the last 150 years of language teaching philosophy. The back-in-time and angel-and-devil skits were a little cheesy sometimes, but they helped to keep things interesting. More detail on some of the information presented would be nice, but it seems to be aimed at inexperienced teachers or people with native languages other than English, and so the level is kept fairly low.Overall, a good introduction to the subject and enough information provided to launch into your own independent study of some of the concepts introduced.",4
nice presentations and interacting pretty well i had learned and enjoyed,4
This was useful.,4
"This is an excellent introduction to programming. The exercises are very dynamic and the tutors did a great job by explaining the program, both in English and Spanish. The bonus interview might seem like extra time but it's totally worth it. The only recommendation for the class is not to rush the exercises after the 3 week. Thank you!",4
"Really enjoyed this course, thank you x",4
Very good introduction to global energy situation.,4
Useful bite-sized knowledge on improving study techniques.,4
"It's good, is the beginning to understand social media in a simple way.I learned interesting information and sites in this world of social media, however I think the should introduce you in a more personal way, give differences between taking this as persona or as company",4
Nice MOOC. Nice Last course. AR Track is very nice.,4
"Overall this is a really great course.My small criticism: Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas. I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from. This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion, but if this information were contained in the course content (e.g. optional videos assuming some linear algebra background), it would be even better.",4
Very good course.,4
Loved the short but sharp classes! Thank you! Would love to see more peer reviews (didn't get any on my poems yet).Best of luck!Katya,4
"Tons of math, but I achieved what I was looking for.",4
Great introduction course for people with absolutely no prior knowledge,4
"very cool stuff, although the content could be a bit more compressed for this course and the next, I have the feeling that there are many redundancies and stuff that comes more than once",4
easy but useful,4
"This course is very effective to build up the basic foundation of HTML,CSS and JS.",4
A good place to start learning any programming language.,4
"A terrific overview of financial markets nearly up to the present. I enjoyed Professor Shiller's insights and enthusiasm for his field and particularly enjoyed his attempts to point out how knowledge of financial markets empowers individuals to help even the economic playing field for individuals throughout our society. The guest speakers added another level of authenticity to the experience.On the negative side, I thought the exams were not optimally designed since specific minute items appeared to be emphasized to the exclusion of more conceptual questions,Overall I think the course is worth the time of anyone interested in finance at any level of complexity.",4
"I love the course content, and especially peer review assignments. I have one negative feedback for Cheri Alexander course contents for number of things:1- Too much repetition.2- Very vague examples were used. More practical & complete examples should be included. Moving talent across different departments does not happen often, so this can be replaced with some good example.Thanks,Adnan",4
"Good overview, but less theory. Would also maybe be good to have had a section on starting from a problem and how to select a technique (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, etc.).",4
"It was a very interesting course. It has benefited me to stimulate my creative juices. Would really love to continue its next module if any.Thank you all the Facilitators for your support,help and guidance.",4
Simply great!!!,4
"The programming exercises aren't really all that challenging...just implement the formulas provided in the course or in the assignment itself, and you're mostly done.I hate the questions on the quizzes that are ""Select all the following that are true..."" The only questions I ever got wrong on quizzes were of that sort.",4
I think it's too simple....... I finished this course in 2 days.,4
"Maybe, it will be useful to add more theory about 3 normal forms?Thank for awesome database introduction. I've had lack of practice with 3 normal forms, but you fixed it.",4
"This is a good course for someone who is not familiar with the basics of Git,Github and needs to install R,Rstudio and related packages. If you are not the kind of person described above you will be able to breeze through the course very fast.",4
"Very interesting and enjoyable. There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course. I think I'll do it again and extract even more now that I've been through it once. I find the material consistent with my own practice of mindfulness meditation, and with my studies in psychology.Thank you for a wonderful and stimulating experience. I am recommending it to family and friends so we can discuss this matter in greater depth.",4
"cool , i like it but if it has some thing more like sensor it was be better",4
It is great start for begginers in game dev. But there is lack of materials for self-learning and additional organized theory.,4
"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and learned a lot, though there were some technology 'glitches' to overcome.I would recommend that the administrators, for future courses, ask students to upload their assignments as PDFs, as this would enable non-Microsoft/Open Office etc. users to review the assignments directly in their browser, rather than having to download the files, convert them, then dispose of them :)",4
"awesome, very good explainded, and very enjoyable",4
The course is very useful. It helps me learn many skills in Email.,4
very interesting course; the subject treated here seems to have wide applications in geometry and number theory; the weekly assignments were challenging at times but very thought provoking and I very much enjoyed myself during the course despite some minor flaws,4
"good course, really an introduction =)But the teacher is always reading a ""Teleprompter"".He is not spontaneous... Except when He uses RPG to demonstrate an example ;-)But the content is great",4
"Unlike the rest of the modules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quizzes (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignments across the specialisation is frustrating, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case.",4
One of the best online course available for data analysis using Excel as main tool for analysis.,4
I liked it very much. An accomplishment diploma would have been ok.Thank You!!,4
"the final quiz should be more difficult, or questions reworded to help internalize information in a deeper way.",4
Awesome course! Will definitely tell other people about it,4
"This class taught me a lot about the basics of typography, however I didn't feel too encouraged creatively compared to the last class in this series. I understand that type is a bit more structured and requires more attention to detail and rules than other forms of visual art, but I wish there was a bit more content similar to the content in week 4 where we are encouraged to get creative.",4
Excellent structure of the course and very interesting,4
"very interesting courses, but there is written material that you can go when you want to refresh concepts.",4
great course.. only thing is answers to teradata exercises were not provided. So student cannot know whether he is writing correct sql statements,4
good course in project management field,4
A course help me a lot in Excel. I can apply what I have learned in my daily work.,4
"Excellent informative class., made very interesting by Professor Thompson",4
Clearly explained walk-through of many Excel features. Well structured. Full worksheet view in videos meant that individual cell contents were hard to see on my smaller screen.,4
"The course is nice, the lectures are really clear. Professor Lee is brilliant and he often gives some excellent interpretations of Bayesian results. For example, the classic example of testing for rare diseases is explained in terms of ratio of true positives to all positives. Another example is the explanation of predictive mean for normal models, or the explanation of noninformative priors. They're all clearer than what usually found in many books. The only limit of the course is that it's strictly an introduction, thus very useful topics for applications such as hierarchical models or nonconjugate models are not covered.",4
Good beginning course.,4
very useful.,4
it helps me a lot,4
"It covers all the basics. In addition to it, leading industry personality talks enhances the course content.",4
This course gives a brief idea about Data Science. It is helpful for the beginners.,4
Very easy to understand. Suitable for psychological newbies like me. The only thing I regret is that some video links offered by the course are not available.,5
"The lectures were amazing, with lots of content but easy to follow. The examples were great to make everything clear.",5
"Thank you for having this course. I enjoyed it thoroughly, the materials were well prepared and the programming exercises were excellent. I would be really happy to be a part of more of such courses from Stanford. Awesome work guys!",5
Exciting and Challenging approach,5
The first two courses in this series have really rekindled my interest in software development after many years away from it. Kalman does a great job - the lectures are interesting and the assignments are challenging.,5
This course is great for people who want to learn the latest about being a good teacher.,5
Amazing course!,5
Life changing! Understanding the benefits of engagement and nurture marketing strategies will completely change the way you market your company!,5
"This is a remarkable course for the insight that it gives into negotiation. Previously I would have approached negotiation scenarios (like the course example of sharing the cost of business flights) with just a couple of options in mind (e.g. ""split the cost"") but this course has opened my mind to a far richer variety of options, and more importantly how to reason about those options (and so hopefully negotiate a good deal) and how to ""expand the pie"" with more options. The animations are visually cute, but they are also so rich in ideas that the transcripts essentially form a good set of notes about the topic, and they are infused with Barry's sense of fun. My only complaints are that the last couple of weeks of interviews with negotiators aren't as rich/interesting as the first part of the course (though Cohen was great), the early examples are perhaps overly numeric (though probably justifiably for simplicity), and from peer assessments it seemed that many students had little understanding of probability/expected value. But overall, a fantastic course!",5
"Nice course, well presented, good level assessments and example. Well done, thanks",5
Great introductory course on budgeting and scheduling. Very helpful video tip on critical path.,5
"Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for this amazing course.This course was very challenging for me because I haven't studied for 20 years and it was my first english specific course with an anglophone university ...You definitively changed my way of thinking about learning and my life thanks to all these mental tools...learning how the brain works, how to built more neurons and to strenghten them was amazing... I discovered Neuroscience and I love it.Learning has become for me an evidence because it opens our mind ...So thank you very much :-)",5
"Excellent instructors, very interesting subject and great learning experience. Highly recommended Course for those aiming to master this subject.",5
Very good course! Well structured!,5
This is the history course I should have been taught at school!,5
It was really good!! I really could learn CSS and I'm already working in my projects.,5
excelent introduction to pro tools,5
Should be a required course for all C-level execs of medium and large public companies and the leaders of their stakeholders at the institutional investors. Essential insight that I did not get earning an MBA in 1985.,5
Fun and can learn a lot!,5
Great course!,5
"The most informative biology course I've ever took. The course is well-structured, interesting, and covers all the important points. The course is directed toward non-professionals, anyone can take it, even if you know nothing about the topic.",5
It was great! Thank you so much for this course!,5
"Very good course to begin with and generally get into the frame of mind to apply a bottom up approach when thinking of a solution to a problem. Don't expect to start designing things right after this course, but you will start thinking and approaching problems from different angles.",5
"Amazing course. I learnt everything I wanted (and needed) to know about the basics of good nutrition. I loved how the course doesn't just give you general information but also practical tips to shop, cook and eat better. I feel that I gained knowledge but also the ability to apply this knowledge in my everyday life, which is very empowering. As a social scientist, I appreciated the effort put in addressing socioeconomic factors affecting people's diet. To me, the course was complete and thorough its its objectives, and the great quality videos were very enjoyable to watch. I could tell that there was a team of professionals who put their passion and skills behind each one of them.",5
"Really practical course, not just theory. Great job!",5
Basics financial markets with a human perspective. I really recommend this course for people who want to learn and know much more than usually lecture about financial markets,5
The professor clearly explains the basis of these technologies.,5
Great introduction to the big history concept. Awesome production. Content of the last two weeks is significantly weaker than the rest though,5
Really good and useful!! Thank you!!!,5
A really interesting course and very helpful when it comes to eating. Not only for children but for oneself too. There course gives you theory and recipes which is a good combination to emphasize the understanding,5
The course provide a general introduction of this field and the methods usde in the experiments.,5
"This is a very good course, specially for internalizing the basics!",5
"It is a really good course, but it is designed for complete beginers. I took it as a review of fundamentals and didn't learn nothing new, but I didn't have those expectations. I just wanted a pure review of things I already know. It was fun and maybe a bit too easy - even for beginers. :)",5
Great Course.Nice Way of teachingThanks Professor,5
Excellent course. PM in a nutshell.,5
Great content! Well explained and easy to understand.,5
Really easy to understand and the best place to start to learn machine learning!,5
Great introductory course.,5
"Great course, great professor. This course lays the simple groundwork upon which to build the full discipline of investment underwriting and analysis. Look forward to taking the next courses!",5
"I am a masters student doing an EV related lab project, this course has provided great insight into EV research from leaders in the field. Importantly, this has made me aware of what to look out for in the literature.Many Thanks!",5
The instructor is really clear and fun. Workload is reasonable.,5
This is must to learn course for every body as a life skill. I loved and find the course more helpful for my growth.,5
"Professor Asher Susser is a very good speaker, and the course is very well organized. The subjects he discuss are very interesting; I enjoyed listening to him for hours. I will absolutely participate in the second part of this course as well as the course about the modern history of Israel.",5
"Fantastic MOOC! This course is great for the ones who want to learn more about Terrorism studies and Terrorism History. It's not a easy one, if you are commited to read all the sugested readings, However it does give you a solid backgorund in this area of study, and it's a nice beggining for the ones, like me, that intend to continue to study Terrorism & Counterterrorism at a University level.",5
"This class was a great introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for someone with prior programing experience (I've done Python, R, MATLAB, and a tiny bit of C++). It was exactly the overview of all the basic/most important features of the three ""languages"" (I use quotes because HTML is actually a language). By no means will this make you any kind of expert, but if you're interested in web development on the side and already know how to program, this is a great place to start.",5
relevant course for everyone to take,5
Inspiring lecturers! I enjoy every lesson with clear instruction and exciting moments. Thanks all for bringing the course online so that I can learn it conveniently. Highly recommended!!,5
Best introductory course on Python ever! Dr. Chuck is an amazing teacher!,5
Great!,5
great class,5
The course is well formatted with excellent explanation and easy to follow videos.,5
A great brief introduction. A good starting point for other Data Analytics/Science coursework.,5
"It was an amazing and interesting course, i don't think I've ever enjoyed a course as much as this one. Hats off to John Covach, because, when I usually do a course on Coursera the teacher is often quite boring, but I enjoyed his dramatic feelings that he expressed during the course. Thank you.",5
absoultley loved the course and while giving assignments we cannot completly relay on course content.,5
Good helpful course.,5
Got a deeper level of understanding and connection! It's a very good course.,5
Excellent course with amazing practical exercises!,5
"The course is a ""Life - Changer"" ! Andrew Ng is the best professor I have ever had. He is the reason I have decided to pursue my masters in machine learning. He breaks a complex concept down into chunks which are simpler to understand and thereby explaining that concept. I feel like I can apply this knowledge to any domain, be it robotics, finance, biology, etc. Do go for this course, because it'll change your life. It has changed mine.",5
"Excellent course. Extremely educational and informative. Thank you for sharing, wish the team all the very best.",5
A very nice course!,5

funny and enthusiastic lecturer make a dry subject more fun.,5
"Great course. Initiate you to review much of your math and engineering control knowledge by specific problems. This is more of an application course, you see the application, the math behind and use Matlab to program certain situation. Beware, it's a one month course so they don't spend time to walk you through the basic math, some specific terms are explained during the lecture but not all, a reference for some Control book maybe needed to know what are those terms.If you have no knowledge in these area, some supplemental material maybe provided but be ready to learn and explore more on your own.",5

"One of the first big books I remember reading was about dinosaurs and their world: much of the information changed with further discoveries, but the book gave me such a sense of wonder at the big ""lizards"" that roamed the earth!I found this course fascinating, especially since it follows on Dino 101. This helped me to see the various evolutionary tracks that were possible, and how the wide avian diversity came about. Looking at the anatomy development was very helpful to this bird-watcher/dino-watcher.Thank you so much for opening this program -- it has been a joy and I am looking forward to the other course openings as they come up.",5

Very good course that features intersting lecturers that provide you with real insights.,5
The course was excellent. I've become a huge Robert Wright fan.,5
"A very useful course. I like the model of a quadrotor very much. I also like that the professor shares their research papers and PhDs. The only thing I don't like are the changes in notation in different lessons / programming exams (this goes for ""des"" variables""). In addition, the supplementary materials, should be read by some one with a little bit less pitch in the voice :P",5
Dr. Chuck is a gifted teacher. Loved the course.,5

Takes a seemingly complex subject and makes it incredibly simple and comprehensible to everyone! LOVE LOVE LOVE this course and any course taught by Dr. Chuck. This is part of an entire specialization. The only thing that is really lacking is an in-depth discussion of OOP. He briefly touches on it so that you know to go and look at it on your own time, but I wish he touched on it a little more. Nonetheless, 5/5 on this course. Thanks Dr. Chuck and supporting staff that make this course worth taking. The forum is still ACTIVE and if you run into problems a TA will be there to help you out! Critically to anyone's style of learning.",5

Great course. Very educational. I wish there were other free online medical-level courses of this quality available.,5
A very good encouragement to learn,5
"Excellent course on the use of regression in machine learning. It does not simply stop with simple linear regression but also tackles ridge and lasso regression using Python notebooks. One big advantage for those not familiar with Python is that the Python notebooks have just enough boiler plate code to make it feasible for Python beginners but not so much that the challenge is gone. The lectures can feel rather technical at times but this, at least in my mind, enhances the course and at no point did I feel I was ""drowning"" in formulas.",5
Very good overview of the topic of machine learning.,5
"I love it! This course is fun and informative, I'm proud to be enrolled.",5
really good for understanding ml in general and getting a feeling about how to apply the presented algorithms,5

"I like this course very much as it talks clearly about the basic concept in this course.(Prerequisite: I have learned this course before, I just try to review all the info in this class.)",5
"Loved this course! Dr. Chuck makes it fun by adding the bonus material - office hours videos as well as the fantastic interviews with all the computing greats whose work we've used so far but haven't had any chance to interact. The course itself is great at explaining tricky topics including web architectures involving crawlers, search engines, data wrangling code etc. without turning off new learners.The sql/ rdbms part eases learners into using DRI with without the actual declarations rather inserts and updates, but this is so vital a concept for databases that there could possibly be some bonus video explaining this with a little bit more rigor (as sqlite does support foreign key references). Nevertherless a great course keeping in mind that it primarily deals with programming in python rather than db code.",5
"Liked the course a lot. The textbook and lectures are very helpful. I recommend doing ALL of the exercises in the book, not just the assigned ones, in order to learn the most.",5
Great course! Great teacher!,5

really fun and educational,5
"It is a very well-structured French language course which encompasses every needs of living when you arrive in France for further study. It also has a metaphysical angle for higher command of the language. That is the constant exposure to different extracts of literature or exploring further on some language issues. It also has a touch with the current web culture and popular movies in France to make the course more real and down to earth. Professors are engaging with lucid, solid and well-thought explanations which could help clearing ambiguities. This course is a real success. I genuinely wish the team of École Polytechnique could expand further into providing the online courses for C1 and C2, or even French history and literature courses.",5

I would like it to be a little more alive, as the main topic is evolving really fast.

"Very informative but I think that, if I hadn't already had a basic knowledge of the Korean alphabet and grammar structure, I'd have found the grammar explanations to be a bit too brief. Excellent for beginner level refresher though. Some glitches in the tests (e.g. the correct answer being something not taught until the next lesson) and the videos (one lesson unable to be downloaded on any of the computers to which I have access). Would be good if this course had some social /cultural lessons (like how to drink in front of a superior",5

This course does not only teach the languages but also teaches the best ways to approach a problem, and how to implement our approach into coding. I have learned various image editing techniques, gained domain knowledge and even built my own full website. The only downside is that the javascript libraries which is used in most of the exercises is written by Duke itself so I'm not sure if I'll be able to use them outside the course. But these libraries really helped understand the process.",5

Excellent contents.. Good speed.Evaluation was challenging but not too strict...Looking forward to more courses on Coursera.,5
"I had no previous background in game theory before taking this course. I am an undergraduate physics major with the corresponding mathematical competence (up to multivariable calculus, differential equations, etc.), and an introductory course in Discrete Math. So I had seen the set theory and summation notation before, but had no experience applying them to game theory.The instructors were excellent and clearly have a deep academic background in the subject, as well as a significant personal interest. This is important because they didn't come off as if they were just relaying information; they gave the impression of genuinely enjoying the material and even going into brief interludes about the motivation behind some of the definitions and examples from their personal perspectives, in addition to the more ""standard"" lecture material.The course is definitely an introduction, and doesn't go into most of the more formal proofs of the theorems used, nor does it use examples or homework problems that require a significant background in the subject. I found I was able to complete most of the problem sets within 4-5 hours, with an average of about 3 hours. But your mileage on this may vary, especially if you're less familiar with the mathematical notation and the style of problem solving used. This is not to say the problems are not difficult, because they are! Many of them are non-intuitive and require you to think around corners, or consider methods of thinking and problem-solving that are not commonly used in math and the natural sciences. This, I think, is a byproduct of game theory's preeminent figure -- John Nash's -- unique approach to mathematics. He was famous for using highly intuitive, non-rigorous ways of coming to conclusions before proving them more formally. Thus, the field is a bit unconventional in its methods and approach, and won't be automatically accessible just because someone has already had exposure to advanced math or science. It requires time and careful thought to develop a deep understanding of. But I found that this effort was well rewarded by the end of the course where I started to see all the earlier theorems and techniques coming together to form a unified system of problem-solving capabilities.I strongly intend to take the advanced version of this course that is also offered on Coursera. As for this one, I recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the mathematics of games, competitive environments, and complex systems in general! Very well done by the instructors.",5
Very helpful to develop your academic writing skill,5
Awesome course for introduction to Python. Many thanks to Dr Chuck,5
"Excellent course. It helps to complement the knowledge of data analysis. The project was quite interesting and illustrative, especially considering that they were real experimental data.",5
"Great work, very student friendly and you can't wait to learn more!!",5
"Some of the material could be a bit more analytical, and there were a few problems with the quiz questions. Other than that, perfect! Great introduction to linguistics. Thank you for your hard work!",5
"Great topic, great tools to and advises.I love the examples and the videos.The instructor clearly stated the topic, the outline, the goals, the results.The book was a great investment. Helped me to easily find the information I was looking for.",5
Excellent delivery. Challenging but still accessible. Very interesting content. Highly rewarding experience.,5
Really helpful course to understand the fundamentals of accounting and its business implications. This course is a must for anybody without an accounting background and willing to get into business. I did the course before starting my MBA and it definitely helped me afterwards.,5
I cannot expressed how much I enjoyed this course in words. The instructor was awesome and the course material was great. I hope the second part comes out soon!,5
"It was a really good course, very easy to understand and was good in keeping the interest up. I would only recommend they offered some, at least optional, exercises to help grasp the content.",5
This course is very clarifying and informative. The lecturer is charismatic and didactic.,5
"This is a first course that I finished in Coursera. The course is great. The core project for this course is the unfolding map. Through the project, you can learn a lot of stuff about java. The three teachers are all great. :)",5
A great comprehensive cap to the rest of the MoM courses.,5
very well structured and executed course,5
Very logical and clear approach. Brilliantly explained.,5
very clear introduction. An additional week with a bit more scripting practise would have been nice.,5
Excellent course. The videos by Professor Meloni are greatly supported by follow on presentations and quizes. Great information backed up by the interviews of professionals from the field ad to the learning enviroment. I have already become an advocate for Coursera and reccomended to many of my coleagues.,5
"Really awesome course, even a novice person can relate to these lectures and contents. Programming exercises are great, directly related to course/concept that we are learning.",5
Very interesting！,5

I really enjoyed taking this course. Thank you Arizona State University. Thank you Coursera.,5
Liked the class,5
Very easy fast way to get started with Python,5
Very good course. Great overview on Hotel distribution from many perspectives. Balances well the pros and cons of the various channels. Good essays as well,5
"Very informative and useful course that covers the basics of machine learning to begin with and all other aspects to make one understand and dive deep into machine learning programming.I liked for the fact that, there were so many real use cases in the assignments as well as lectures. There is a lot more to read/know about machine learning out there, but I definitely recommend this program as it makes one prepared for whats, whys and hows of Machine Learning.A big thanks to the moderators/mentors and Andrew Ng - just loved his way of teaching! Huge thanks Andrew!",5
Really Like the course. Have been interested in Machine Learning for quite a few days and this course has given me the right foundations.,5
"This course is just packed with so much information. I mean that in a good way too. John pieces the whole history of rock in a way the is digestible, engaging and interesting. I primarily watch the videos. I'm a music fan and just love learning more about rock's trajectory. Didn't know that there was so much history to it. And in case this wasn't enough, be sure to check out part 2. Thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the history of rock and music.",5
Great one for people who need to implement it for websites and are not concerned about the underlying stuff.,5
awsome !,5
"This course was very interesting and gave insight to the kind of material first year veterinary students would be learning plus history of the profession (mostly the school). The professors present actual anatomical (dissected) organs and histology slides. I also thought the husbandry section well done. The clinical portion is a little weak but understandably, given the medium and safety issues. I still enjoyed it. The history portion is a bit too in depth, I feel, and though interesting, spends a great deal of time on the history of the school and founder itself. They are very enthusiastic though, which is a plus. The course does a lovely job of presenting some of the various studies that go into this rigorous education/career, such as client interaction, anatomy, histology, animal husbandry, and examination skills. It is so much more than just a love for animals. I will certainly look into some of the other animal science-related MOOCs offered by Edinburgh. I had no difficulty in completing this course in one week although I do have a medical background.",5
The course is very good.,5
Thanks for all Prof. Joseph Muppala! Good Course!,5

"Overall a solid course that can teach almost anyone who is willing the basics of HTML, which is the basis for web design. If you are interested in Web Design or just want to know more on how webpages work and how they function, then this is the course for you. The concepts may be tricky at first, but the instructor really makes it easy to understand the wide world of HTML. She knows her stuff and provides multiple resources and software recommendations for the topics covered. The whole course is organized and it is easy to manage what you need to do. The workload is manageable but be aware that you may struggle if you are simply watching videos, as the quizzes do test your knowledge on not only the topics covered in the videos, but textbook readings as well. My only issue is that there are some sections that are not available, or have changed and have yet to be updated or removed. It's a small issue but I thought I'd mention it.Overall though, solid course, solid instructor, and you will learn alot!",5
Very comprehensive course.Thank you,5

"I am very happy to have completed the course. I was able to learn a lot about various aspects of astronomy, especially galaxies and globular clusters that are objects that call my attention. I was able to read much of the material provided in teachastronomy, thank you for the kindness of making the material available. I watched all the videos of Professor Chris and I was able to follow well due to the availability of the subtitles in English, this was important. The interviews I could not follow completely by the lack of subtitles. This was a great opportunity for me that likes astronomy, but because of the distance that I live from the great centers of study, it is very difficult to access good and reliable information. I am very grateful and congratulate the institution for making this course available.",5

"Wonderful course, very well explained. Professor is great!",5
"The course has specific, brief and well-explained examples. It is very easy to understand as well.",5
"Professor Severance is awesome. I really like how each video is an in-depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when. I think his sense of what's important is spot on as I've already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects, the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter. The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned. I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week's material, especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more. I think more chapters on this in the book could be very helpful though.",5
"Both courses from this lector are very useful and beneficial, strongly recommend. At 2 of the weeks in this one he uses videos from the other course, so maybe you want to pass it first and safe time here later.",5
very good introduction for microbime in gut,5
The course is full of fun. I like the interesting assignment and I learned a lot from doing by myself and reviewing other students' work. I also got feedback from my classmates which helped me a lot.,5

Great course and great tools to learning how to learn. I think that I always will read this course to keep in mind all the concepts that i learnt here.,5
"I have been reading about buddhism for a little while, and this course has shown me a bit of the great complexity, a most human comparison between differen schools where each one claims to be ""better"" (no doubt buddhists are also humans), the great importance of cultural differences between east and west, etc.I have also been fascinated by the introduction to neuroscience, the great complexity of our brain, the drawings of a blind man, our multiple channels to access and interpret the worl around us.And I am also grateful for the introduction to meditation practices.This is a great Coursera course, thanks to all those persons and institutions that have made it available for so many of us,,,",5

It helped me try new things and revealed to me a wealth of information that otherwise would still be unknown to me if not for me enrolling in this course. It was also made more friendly to us youth because of analogies on zombies and vampires :)One thing that I was slightly bothered about was the volume of the videos. Maybe an increase in volume would make it less hard for people who have to access Coursera in noisy places to listen.,5
The third one in this specialization is the best one.,5

Very good course!,5
Great course and teacher!!!,5
"Very well presented course.To certain degree, the concepts are basic. If you're looking for a course that explains the physiological effects of sodium or the chemical reaction of glucose, this is not it. However, it gives sensible advice about how to eat well for a healthy life.I took away a number of good ideas. Also, the course helped me put into a wider context some things I already knew in a disjointed manner, which helped me to understand them better.Good structure, script, presentation (including interaction between the presenters), visuals...In summary, I feel following this course was time well spent.",5

"Before starting this course, I had no previous knowledge of machine learning and I had never programmed in Octave and I have little/no programming skills. This is a 11-week course and so I was not sure if I would make it to the end (or even get through the first week) but I was keen to learn something new.Positive Aspects: The course is extremely well structured, with short videos (and test questions to help us verify if we have understood the concepts), quizzes and assignments. Prof. Andrew Ng presents the concepts (some very difficult) in a clear and almost intuitive manner without going too much into detail with mathematical proofs, making the course accessible to anyone. The mentors were fantastic and provided prompt responses, links to tutorials and test cases, which all helped me get through the course.Negative Aspects: Searching the Discussion Board for something specific was no easy task. I would have liked to have known the answers to some of the questions in the quizzes that I got wrong.What I loved about this course: Learning how powerful vectorization is, it allows us to write several lines of code in one single line and can be much faster than using for-loops. I was wowed several times.Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He is also extremely humble and very encouraging. During the course he often said, ""It's ok if you don't understand this completely now. It also took me time to figure this out."" This helped me a lot. He also said, ""if you got through the assignments, you should consider yourself an expert!"" and I laughed silly. By no means do I feel like an expert but now I have a basic understanding of the different types of learning algorithms, what they could be used for and more importantly this course has generated a spark in me to use this tool for things that I find interesting and for that I am very grateful. I don't think a teacher has ever thanked me for assisting a class. This is a first-time! So thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and everyone who worked to put this course together. Also, special thanks to Tom Mosher (mentor). My best MOOC so far!",5
"The control over the marketing mix has been shifting from the companies to the consumers, thanks to today's digital tools. If you have a mobile phone and access to the internet, take this course.",5
I think this was a great course. It goes through high-level concepts as well as digs down into implementation of common algorithms. Professor Ng explains concepts well enough for a novice to easily follow. Would recommend this course to anyone looking for a primer on machine learning.,5
Great course! I recommend!!!,5
Quite interesting and very relevant as a good reminder of the fundamental concepts.,5
Excellent course about learning and how your brain works. Definitely I'll try teach my 10 years old son techniques from this course and explain him all what I learned to help him make his life easier with learning. Knowledge is power and power is freedom.Thank you very much for opportunity to go through this course. You did great job guys.,5
great course,5

"Considering that it is a introductory course of just 7 weeks I consider that it achieved its goal. Don't expect a deep explanation about the physics of the devices and complicated circuits. If it is you first time learning electronics it will help understand the basic concepts and I recommend it. If you want to remember some basic concepts I recommend it too, but if want to learn more advanced topics like high frequency response of an amplifier, communication circuits, cascode, differential and operational amplifiers this is not a course to you.",5
Excellent course for beginners of students aspiring data analytics as a career. It teaches us the fundamentals of R programming language with utmost clarity and challenging assignments.

It is suitable for those who are knew to this field, and also fascinating for those who have some prior knowledge.",5
what an awesome course! The Lecturar makes complex things appear simple. Highly recommended.,5
"This course presents different moralistic views in a highly engaging, easy to understand, and most importantly - relevant manner. By linking different moral philosophies to our everyday lives, Professor Bloom shows us just why morals and ethics are so important to think about, and are not just theoretical philosophy that won't be put to good use. This course will make you wiser, a more critical thinker, and you'll have lots of fun doing it. 10/10 would recommend!",5
"Excelent course, it fulfilled my personal goals and motivated me to keep advancing in the field.",5
Simply Superb. Things are explained in such a clear manner with great examples.,5
"The course is valuable especially due to the personality of the teacher. As an obviously experienced developer, Mr. Chaikin provides you with modern techniques of using Javascript and responsive design. You'll probably encounter most of these techniques in the real life of a developer. The course is centered on practicing and the pace is fast. Don't be mislead by the colloquial tone and the quality humor present in lectures. Although the humor is good, you'll need to replicate most of the code examples on your machine, if you want to feel you've really learned something at the end of the day. That being said, the course is not perfect: the AJAX part might deserve more room in the future versions of this course. For those with previous exposure to some web techniques (my case), the course was an excellent refresher.",5
"Excellent course, which gives a hands-on overview of all the recent algorithms being used.",5
Pretty good.,5
Great course for beginners just like me! Prof Severance is explaining very clearly and slowly enough to get into the matter. The book is very good as well. I find the assignments complex enough with the relevant level of difficulty for each week.Definitely am recommending it to all of my friends!,5
"This course is an absolute must for everyone wishing to get a good start in programming. Everything: from the quality of materials to the charm of Mr. Severance makes you want to return to the course and view another lecture, learn something new or succesfully complete another assignment.No, literally, that is supercool!",5
Excellent introduction to Aristotle.,5

Looking forward for more quality courses. One step at a time!",5
Great course based on lectures and your own considerations. The course focus on old and new model of business and its impact on the society. What is important it shows the ways to recreate value of companies by concious leadership. After the course you get the idea of corporate social responsibility (not only in big companies) and how it may create value.,5
"Great course, loved it! Maybe a bit easier than the previous ones in this specialization, or maybe it's just because I started using python(compared to java and c in previous courses). Anyways the course was fun. :)",5
Excellent course for providing the basic elements of graphic design. It's helped me launch my graphic design career! I can't say anything bad about it!,5
Exceptional but i still feel that reading material should be free of cost.,5
Very clear and inclusive. Lots of practical examples too.,5
Very good introduction to Internet of things and Augmented reality.My time was worth doing the courseThank you !!,5
I learn several topics about writing essay. It helped me to improve my writing skills. Thanks,5
"Having taken a lot of computer science courses by coursera, I can confirm this course is in the top two most valuable investments of my time/money along with Martin Odersky's scala course.I am an experienced java back-end developer, but have never worked in the front-end. And yet I found the material in this course very easy to follow. This is up to the teacher's talent to present the basic concepts with exceptional clarity, in the correct order and depth. Now, I am waiting for Yaakov to give a course about Angular 2!If you are a back-end developer and want to do your first step to front-end development this course is a must!",5
I love Python and thank you professor!,5
"This has given me a lot of ideas on how to handle the reading, writing, and grammar parts of ESL lessons. Kudos to all the ASU professors who made this series a huge success!",5
"Professor Wright is very engaging and knowledgeable! He breaks down Buddhism in an intellectual manner that does not demean the spirituality of it, but also does not adhere to it. This makes the course both educational and easy to digest, for anyone with an aversion to spiritual matters (which you will learn in this course may be a source of suffering...). I am only on the 2nd week of lessons and can't wait to see this through to the end! In an unattached appreciative manner of course... haha. Thanks to everyone that put forth the effort to design and share this course!",5
Really great instruction...this is the course if you are new to programming. I completely understood the foundation of programming and python.,5
"Excellent, though it is very brief",5
A much needed course for all those students who have strong fundamentals in C Programming but lack the OOP skills in C++.Still there is a scope of improvement.,5
Great starting point for learning how to use Ableton Live.,5
"I found the course material and the presentation style to be very engaging and very easy to apply in my personal and professional life. As a project manager, a team leader, a teacher, and just as a person who is always looking to learn new things, I left this course very satisfied and fulfilled. I've already recommended this course to several of my friends and have already applied techniques, such as the pomodoro technique and recall in my daily life, while also examining how einstellung transpires in my day to day decision-making.Thank you for the wonderful lessons the past few weeks!!!!",5
"My first class on Coursera! I really learned a lot and enjoyed taking this class by Prof. Andrew Ng. He's an excellent professor and his industry experience and academic depth really shows. He has knack for simplifying complex ideas and highlighting what's important. The programming assignments were challenging and the quizzes made sure you understood the nuances and details of key points. Overall, I really like the Coursera online teaching platform.",5
"I loved to follow this course and learn the basics of Unity3D to start making my own games.The material was well structured, and Brian challenged the students to learn and test what they learned with the course quizzes and the projects.I have recommended this course to my all friends.",5
I like a lit to undestand better the leanguage,5
very nice course,5
I really think that this course is the best specialization already available online. I didn't regret to pay for a certificate.,5
A should do course!,5
Thank you for helping me; this course will help my career and personal habits.I'd like to know about the future courses you will be giving on coursera.THANK YOU AGAIN !,5
"Teaching style a little loose for me, but man did he make me work on my assignments. The information is valuable and the references are beneficial. My take-away from attending this course gives a good base on how to think about a game and set things up properly from the start. No quick short cuts here. Just good old fashion hard work and how to approach things logically to get things done constructively and productively.",5
"The movie clips at the beginning made me wonder if the course was going to be worth it, but once you get past that, it gets very interesting",5
Excellent course.I learned lot of valuable things.Thank you.,5
"Really interesting, straight to the point, the teacher is passionating, thank you for this wonderful course!",5
Great Course!,5
The whole online course was a wonderful experience. Its easy and can become more perfect with the assignments. I thank Sharad Borle sir for explaining the course in an easy and perfect way.

One of the best introductory courses on machine learning.,5
Thanks a lot!,5
I've taken several music courses on Coursera and Introduction to Classical Music was my favorite.,5
This is my first philosophy course. Many concepts were introduced but they are well explained with good reference materials. I have learned a lot thanks to the teacher's dedication in building the course,5
The combination of video with a text book to review helped me grasp the concepts and review them effectively. I enjoyed the format of the course. I worked out the examples on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.0. A lot of syntax nuances that would have been hard to grasp without the text book. Thank you Professor.,5
"This was a fascinating course on how to revive a failing business area by use of government financing of primarily tech start-ups. It was a place in the country that is very different than Silicon Valley. The knowledge to finance a new startup was very limited and had to be set up in government funded groups that could mentor all the new businesses. There was a quick tour to other countries such as Greece which showed that even the EU had set up a Fund for Greek startups. The one they were working on was a company that was trying to produce an app. They did say that due to the lack of tech knowledge in their country the EU Fund was still full of money and could fund other startups. The main course went back to Cleveland, where most of the effort was made to use a government approach. They set up their own foundations, extended loans, made contacts with Venture Capitalists that participated in Silicon Valley and in this new type of gov approach. After 10 years of working with this, they had some very good companies with great ideas. The only drawback was that they didn't employ enough people to revitalize the entire area of Cleveland. They were just beginning to do something that used the actual resources of the area. There was a well known Cleveland Medical Center and some of the Professors there had done research which was new. For some reason, again the lack of business resources, they had never created any companies from what they knew. They did begin to create companies from the medical researchers in the area. The main one had to do with maintaining cardiac health. And",5
"The course is well-laid and very interesting. Even though the material is pretty difficult and advanced. As always the great talent of Christine, Mia and Leo is beyond praise.I definitely recommend this course for developers who want to improve their mastery.Many thanks for the brilliant course.",5

Great Course :),5
Gives you a broad knowledge of all the different ways you can interact with the Arduino. Starting withe simplest elements as resistors and LEDs and ending in the most complex and advanced interfaces i.e. ethernet and wireless interfaces. Your knowledge will increase exponentially with every minute you use to study. Personally I consider this course a great and thrilling ride.,5
Very informative. I cant wait to apply what I have learn from this course. Big thanks to the professors and eawag,5
This course was inspiring. I would love to share it with everybody!Thanks.,5
Great information delivered in an engaging way. Thank you!,5
IT's just perfect course to jump start your programming skills in python and in addition to that when it's Dr.chuck as instructor the class is never boring.,5
Very good course! The focus is much higher on the practical aspects than the mathematics behind (which is often the opposite case for university classes).,5
I HAD A BLAST TAKING THIS COURSE!!! THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!ATT FELIPE,5
"I like this course Introduction to the internet of things and embedded systems conducted by university of California,Irvine,it gives clear picture of what is internet of things,it is really good course.",5

symtematical teaching how to teach charracter and very useful.,5
Very interesting and well organized course. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much for it. It was very helpful for my new teaching challenge.,5
"Extremely informative course. I found the lectures easy to follow and well organized. I did not pay for the course so I have no feedback from quizzes and thus have no way of being sure I really understand the material as well as I think I do. Other than that, two thumbs up",5
"great!!! In this lecture, I learn how to write R code to analyze data with Machine learning methods.",5
"Great start to the certificate. Sometimes the industry-based case studies seemed jarring--could use a slightly better T-up. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it!",5
The best introduction to functional programming I've seen. The course lectures make for a smooth learning experience and the exercises in the assignments range from simple to moderately challenging and are a good complement for the lectures.,5
Great vision and lively lectures.,5
I couldn't purchase the course but I did all the assignments and followed along with the lectures and the instructions. The part I liked the most was the project based way of learning. The slides were well prepared. All in all it was a good and faster way of getting an intro into HTML and Javascript.,5
It was my first specialization and I had a wonderful time completing it.I am looking forward for Business Analytics and Entrepreneurship capstone from Wharton Online.Thank you...!!!!,5
Really simple and easy to understand introduction for beginners with a really charasmatic teacher!,5
Really coool,5
"The course is a great first course on algorithmic toolbox. I love the way the toolbox serves as a precursor to the more involved courses. In particular, the topic of stress testing is something that MOOCs don't cover in general and lead me to give up in my earlier MOOCs.All in all, great job professors Sascha, Daniel, Neil, Michael and Pavel.You guys are awesome.",5
"It`s so hard if you don`t understand english well, because the spanish subs are all wrong, but i do my best, and will love more courses like this. <3 <3",5

"A great course about Europe. We will learn a lot about Europe, its instiutions, history, foundations,...And above all you will learn how you can act for Europe. At the end of the course, you will have everything in hand to know how and where to begin to act.You will need to study very seriously for this course but it worth it.",5
Very informative.,5
it's a really nice course and the materials are easy to understand,5
"Well developed, very clear and fast movement at the same time. Good exercises to practice. The method of teaching is encouraging and not boring at all.",5
"I'll strongly recommend this course for those who are interested to introduce themselves to the Social Enterprise world from scratch. Very well explained, easy to understand, logic order for the content, true stories as an examples, inspirational. 100% recommended!",5
"I've been developing in imperative languages for the past 10 years, and my motivation for taking this course was to make sure that I was using the functional capabilities of the language.While I've embraced immutability and higher-order functions since I started writing Scala, I haven't solved significant programming challenges using functional thinking. Much of what I've already done with Scala so far has been relatively stateless request-response communication between systems, and the challenges so far tend to be on the architecture end.This first course taught me useful things that I hadn't encountered in my industry use of Scala. It has given me greater appreciation for the design of the language and the problems that Scala can solve elegantly. I've also acquired more interest in learning about more functional approaches to various problems -- perhaps I'll dig deeper into SICP at some point!The assignments were a good fit for me -- they were challenging enough that they got me to think but not so hard that I got stuck. Scala's rich type system came in handy for the assignments -- once you've got the right idea for an approach, you just have to get the data structures to click (with some help from the compiler), and things just work!I appreciate that the assignments and examples were realistic. Getting to implement Huffman Coding and basic data structures (functional and OO sets) helped me both appreciate the functional way to solve problems like these, and to understand the class of practical problems where similar solutions are applicable.Great course, and I'm excited for the next ones! Thanks to Martin and the course staff for their hard work on the course!",5
Great course with lots of useful and practical insights! Thank you very much!,5
The best thing is that this course teaches you how to surpass procrastination with simple but effective techniques.,5

This was an extremely informative course on ASD. It allows me to assess and design interventions more effectively. Thank you.,5
"Wonderful and usable course. I graduated mathematics 20 years ago, and I regret I didn't have such clear and informative lessons back then when I needed them most. Even now, watching tutorials and doing exercises gave me great pleasure and some new insights into the problems and techniques I failed to catch.Thank you for your effort and dedication!",5
Great,5
"This course is a good, brief introduction to the foundational concepts of data science and some of the tools you can expect to use when doing data analysis with the R programming language. It's best suited to someone who intends to continue at least with the R Programming course that is also a part of this Data Science Specialization.",5
"Thank you for this amazing course, You've taught me new learning techniques and reminded the old ones, that I knew, but didn't use. I loved how you explained the information, visualized it, used different examples and made me think about my learning habits. Thanks again.",5
Thank you,5
"This really gives you a fresh look at the world situtation. If you studied this 10 years ago, repeat it, and you'll see how much it has changed.Congratulations to the ESADE team",5
"I think this Course is a great introduction of Machine Learning. It's suitable for the new learners who are interested in learning machine learning. And Andrew Ng wisely designed the course, distinguished the mathematics and machine learning. So I can study it without reviewing the mathematics specially. I must thank you TA and the members of forum. They helped me a lot, and provided so many materials and clear introductions. All in all, It's a great exploration. Thank you all.",5
Excellent class to understand the basics of the nervous system. Pr Peggy Mason is wonderful!,5

Thanks for the great course.,5
Easy to understand and practical.,5
Excellent course. Continue building on the basics of the prior two courses (Business Strategy & Advanced Business Strategy) which is part of the specialization offered. The professors are fantastic and the course material very relevant to those with a focus on picking up the basics of business strategy.,5
"Compared to the previous courses in this specialization I found this a tough course. Calculating the big-O for yourself wasn't easy. The descriptions of the applications #1 and #2 were not very clear to me at the start (probably because English is not my first language). Some sentences I had to read several times before I understand what was asked. But the things I learned are useful and I am definitely sure that what I have learned here I can use in my work as software engineer. Thank you Luay, Scott and Joe for another excellent course.",5
absolutely great course!!!,5
a very interesting course for anyone who enjoys simple easy to use systems and tools themselves. The last assignment was a great example of the practical applicability of this course,5

Good learning experience.,5
"The lectures are really good, simple to understand and test our ability well in the assessments. The assignments which were partly helped by the lecturers is really provoking students to complete them with ease and precision. It's really practical enough to start coding in a new language realtively easy.",5
Very precise and effective. A course which will definitely boost your productivity :),5
"I took this whole series in 2015 and I thought they were excellent. I had a programming background, but hadn't programmed in about 10 years, and i had no experience with Python. I found the material well presented and the homework interesting and non-trivial. It took me generally about 4-5 hours/week for the lectures and assignments.",5
Very interesting course on water management and policies! I strongly recommend it!,5

i really enjoyed learning this session. :),5
"This course doesn't just help you give an understanding about happiness. It really helps increase your knowledge in a wide variety of areas. Anybody will benefit from this course, but if you're interested in (cognitive) psychology this really helps with building or expanding your knowledge of subjects like motivation. Personally I've done a Master in Applied Cognitive Psychology, and have read about self-determination theory, but never have I seen it applied so broadly to so many subjects. I feel like I understand my own degree much better now. Not just that; since this course I feel like I understand everything and everyone better now...",5
thank you avery good cours,5
"This is my favourite course . The professor is so enthusiastic and passionate to share his knowledge, and is doing a great job. Best course ever !",5
"Great class, easy to follow and very informative!",5
"I enjoyed the course. First, I liked the instructor very much. Dr Zand Scholten explained everything in a very structured and concrete way. Examples were repetitive, but very understandable. Also some of creative assignments (weeks 3, 5, 7) were quite useful for understanding of course concepts.",5
"Good overview of time management, provided decent introduction to strategies.",5
"Very inciteful course, they have set the bar really high!",5
I really enjoyed this course as a non-Finance professional. This is enabling me to better communicate with Finance resources on my team - on their terms.,5

This is the great course about learn... congratulations... the course help me a lot. thanks,5
"Very important for develop nutrition in the style life, congratulation need other for nutrition sport, thanks.",5
its good for beginner,5
It was great and very motivating.,5
"This course by Alvarado, Minnes and Porter was clear, interesting and well presented. In fact, it's one of the better MOOC courses that I've taken.The assignments were of medium difficulty: not too easy but certainly not so difficult that you will get frustrated and give up. In addition, they are interesting assignments. As mentioned, the lectures are concise, clear and interesting. In fact, I recently signed up for another course on algorithms and dropped it because it was SO BORING. Also, I am taking a course on machine learning that presents algorithms. In contrast, that course is not clear whatsoever; if I hadn't taken this one then I would be very confused. Finally, I like how they have the Concept Challenges where students discuss a problem. The thought processes of multiple people talking through the problem was helpful for me.As a result, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to brush up on performance calculations (i.e., Big O), basic data structures, and a few basic algorithms.",5
"Excellent content and teacher. 100% recommended, clarity and accurate information is the constant in these courses. Again, outstanding teacher.",5
"I've been working as a backend programmer for quite some time now. I have experience with languages such as PHP, Python, Java, however, it's been two years since I last programmed in javascript.This course helped me get back to it, with the overall experience being more than excellent.Great course, but if you already have experience with JS, then this isn't for you. It's entry level.",5
very valuable courses and great instructor,5
Excellent course. It gives wonderful tools in order to conduct a successful negotiation.,5
"Great class, thanks!",5
Great learning experience,5
"I very much enjoyed this course and I learned so much! Very simple, easy to understand, but highly informative and valuable information. I would actually take this course a second time as a refresher because I liked it so much! Instructor was very clear, easy to understand, and pleasant to listen to. Her videos were also relaxed and fun which helped keep me interested.",5
It helped me a LOT! Thank you for this course!,5
Perfect.. learning new words and expressions is also great!,5
"A good course for people, who want to get some insight into Data Science",5

Mandatory course for each individual who earns!!!,5
Great!,5
thanks a lot Dr Chuck.,5
Great course! Challenging and interesting! Teaching style both excellent and enter,5
"Liked the interactive exercises and coding assignments, you can actually play with your own datasets using the ideas shown in the course and learn to apply the concepts. The course is really very basic but can be a good starting point.",5
Great!,5
"Thanks to Dan for the excellent course, really enjoyed it!",5
Very nice overview of how web-development is done. It has been of great help to me for developing basic human machine interfaces for robotic systems,5
"Nice introductory course. I thought Prof Balch was a interesting and engaging prof. The assignments were well thought out. Here are some tips: I would not recommend this course without a grasp of python. The more Python you know, the easier it will be. Next, and more importantly, spend time learning Pandas. Pandas is extraordinary, for timeseries data. You will save a tremendous amount of time as you get deeper into this subject if you have a grasp on Pandas. Read the professors text. It is compact and to the point. Expect that you will get more out of this course the harder you work. So, try your own experiments, read the recommended texts. Think of Prof Balch as more of a tour guide and it is up to you to go explore on your own.",5
excellent ! ! ! very useful information and guidelines.,5
"It really help me a lot to have knowledge on Data Science, with the tools we should be using.",5
Its really great for beginners.,5

Best ever on Coursera! Thank you so much!!,5
"Great content that's well explained, with exercises that suit the content well. Content is also presented in a friendly and manageable manner, making going through the course much easier.Be wary of the middle weeks though, as the content in those are heavier than the rest of the course!",5
Very informative and easy to follow. The strategies and principles taught can be used in everyday life and in a professional setting. I am eager to continue with similar courses taught by this professor.,5
THANK YOU!,5
awesome explanation . I suggest everyone to enroll in this Course .,5
Loving it so far...,5
Excellent course for beginners! Great prof! Really funny and knowledgeable :D,5
I still use all of the information in this course even I finished it a few months ago. It was so fundamental and presented so clearly that made the experience of learning really enjoyable. I recommend to anyone to give it a try.,5
"This course is excellent. The level is very appropriate - not beginner but not too advanced. The subject matter is quite applicable for business applications, especially sales, quality, customer relations, and personnel. The teacher is excellent - easy to understand, she repeats important points and vocabulary, and uses clear examples. The quizzes and assignments are good for practicing what has been discussed in the lectures. I hope there is a follow on course!",5
I enjoy how focused and well presented lectures are. My second course from Univ of Virginia prepared in a superb way.,5

I found it very interesting and learned a great deal about how law and legal issues are handled around the world. The instructors did a great job, the course was well put together. Thanks for a new and exciting experience.",5
Really Useful Content.,5
The best course on Machine Learning. Super complete and very well explained the lessons.,5
"Great course.Thank you everyone, the teacher,the university and the Coursera team for providing a valuable course.",5
I'm pretty good at math without consciously knowing why (I used to assume it a math talent). Now I realize the core function behind learning. And I become more confident to conquer other fields of hard science such as statistics and computer science.,5
"I found this course to be excellent. The material is high-yield in every regard, giving the right balance of big-picture understanding coupled with enough detail to flesh out the experience and the understanding. The professor was very direct and clear in his explanations; I consider the course to be extremely well taught. There were a few areas where the explanation could have been slightly more illustrative or detailed, but nobody is perfect. Overall this is a very valuable course and a worthwhile use of time for any medical practitioner who has to interact in any way with the world of research.",5
The course inspires me to learn more about epidemiology.,5
Definitely the best CSS3 tutorial I have seen at Coursera,5
A great introduction to machine learning. Too bad there is no advanced course follow up.,5
Very well designed course for Data Science beginners,5
Great course!Very intuitive and clear.Thanks professor Thaddeus Hogarth.,5

"A course of great value, with very important informations. I wanna another course like this, approaching music marketing! Thank you",5
"Well structured, easy to follow",5
"Prof Raj is a charismatic and engaging professor. Although at first glance, the content may seem theoretically heavy and dull, he teaches in an entertaining way without jargon, and with lots of anecdotes and metaphors, making it easy to follow, and most of all, fun to learn. I would definitely recommend this course for you!OVERVIEWEach module and the entirety of the course is structured very comprehensively. The lectures incorporate various professors who are experts in their field via video conference, telephone, and quotes. Lecture videos (though sometimes long) have lots of embedded quizzes and relevant external videos. Just like taking a course at university, supplemental (yet an optional) reading list is provided for those who wish to explore further.LECTURE VIDEOSProf Raj definitely knows what he is talking about and the videos are easy to follow. There are only a few videos where the audio isn't the best, but transcripts can be downloaded on Coursera, and a clean-format of the transcription can be found on the Facebook page. The animations, lighting, audio, in general are all great.THE COMMUNITYThe discussion forum is very active. With at least three mentors active during the duration of the course, and at least one responding to a post within a business day, you won't feel like you're taking the course alone.CAUTION !Although it states that time commitment is 2-3 hours a week, it will most likely take more than that. The total number of minutes spent on watching all lecture videos (for that week) averages to a little over 2 hours. If you're like me and want to take notes or take a break while studying or re-watch a lecture, you'll need more time. Plus on top of that, there are quizzes and assignments. (You can save time by not submitting assignments via the ISB website.) I would allocate minimum 3 hours a week for this course and maximum 5. Bare this in mind for those who are working or studying full-time or are taking other MOOC courses. - Enjoy the course!",5

Great teacher!!!,5
"This was a really good course, making you ""think"" in general and in particular about mathematical proofs. The professor's exposition was outstanding. The explanation of evaluation of proofs was really nice.",5
Good Start for everybody who want to know about Phyton,5
"Great class and Meteor.js is really wonderful once you understand what it can do. Seamless persistence, i.e. program data and Mongo db, is what you wish all other dev frameworks would give you out of the box. Mongo db integration is missing full-text search capability which is badly needed, I think. But, easy:search package complements it well. I highly recommend this class and this specialization. Pace is great, materials are delivered piecemeal, and the instructor(s) are also great.",5

I also liked that the course was perfectly manageable, unlike all the other MOOC's that I have attempted, where the time commitment turns out to be much bigger than expected.",5
"This course was amazing. I learnt a ton about about Unity and making games. I can give you a long review, but in short, it is challenging to understand, and there are slight loopholes which are hard to figure out sometimes. It was slightly disappointing that the course does not go into coding specifically, like the official tutorials do, but the official tutorials rush learning - these are much better. And when you see those official tutorials, you will see why you don't do much of your own coding - C# is not the easiest language.So, what does that mean? It means that this course is very much worth it for beginners. It is relatively easy to understand, but expect to do a lot of work!",5
The course was well presented and went in depth into the issues surrounding the kingdom of Judah and the city of Jerusalem during a tumultuous time in the 7th and 6th centuries BC.,5

Fantastic overview of Mech-E work.,5
"Its an Excellent course for any beginner , with good material and lectures and case studies.",5
Great course which will help you do your mathematical finance courses.,5
I will never look at advertising with the same eyes. It made me understand a lot of our current society and economy. Really suggested if you want to become a more informed citizen and consumer.,5
"A great course in its own right but it also fills a void between the ""Learn <programming language>"" and using programming languages to analyze Big Data. The instructors have put together an excellent introduction to the wonderful, and scary, world of algorithms. I must admit I was ready to send my PC flying through the window on numerous occasions when I could not get my particular implementation of an algorithm to run within the time AND memory limits set by the instructors. More so, because often you are not told what particular test case made it fail. In the end, I believe this is a great approach to have learners really dive into the material and think about the various run times before submitting a particular solution. Well worth while your time!",5
Very Nice!,5
A very good introductory course for beginners .,5
Very informative and to the point. The instructor guides you step by step along the way to Angular proficiency. Highly recommended.,5

"I am a GIS Analyst who could really benefit from an improved Python skill set. In the past I have tried to take Python courses but became frustrated early on in the classes for a variety of reasons (not enough background info on topics, not enough instructor support, etc.). This class really helped me understand the basics and perhaps more importantly, it piqued my interest. Dr. Severence is great. Stay quirky! It is lots of fun.",5
"While the indidivual lectureres did have a breadth of knowledge, a manditory discusion should be held with the homeworks instead of just the quizzes for completion. Perhaps a page on each week should be good enough. Just to understand each lecturer's main points.",5
Great beginners course on programming computers.,5

"Really interesting thesis about the impetus behind the formation of the Hebrew Bible. Makes a convincing case by linking the historical, geographical, archaeological, and textual evidence. Great lectures and guest lectures. Also provides a case for why studying the bible is important even for secular humanists and atheists. Includes really interesting ideas about the genesis (pun intended) of modern conceptions of nations and states.",5

"I loved being able to hear directly from the leaders of the civil rights movement. The course videos were short enough that I got through the course in two Saturday afternoons. The stories interwove historical events and insights, practical strategies for mobilizing, and inspiring/moving confessions of light in even the darkest times.Some of my favorite parts included learning about the following:-Jails were used as active classrooms for university students! They even shared info on college access with a jail ward. Crazy.-The civil rights leaders honored all people's dignity and believed in their mission beyond what seemed to be in front of their eyes. Who would have thought that the jailed students would sing to jail staff by name, that they'd build a relationship with them, that they'd sing songs of such conviction to uplift their spirits and to warn the system to ""be prepared"" for the many more who'd soon join their movement.-Andrew Young's confession about what his wife told him after they read about Dr. Lafayette, essentially ""drop everything, we gotta go back home NOW."" Their sacrifice and courage, even when they had everything set up for them in the North, are incredible to witness.-The cross-continental influences! I ddin't know Jim Lawson was a divinity school student, who ended up learning non-violence in India where he lived 3 years as a missionary. The intersection of faith, social justice, calling, cross-cultural sharing/empowering were themes I found unable to shake from my mind days after I finished this course.-The civil rights movement was fiercely organized and executed. It didn't happen accidently over night, or by fury or whim of young folks alone. Even the young - so many of the leaders were so young!!! - had a very clear strategy to winning against structural racism, and even their sacrifices ""dares"" so to speak were planned and not foolish. They knew what dangers or threats there may be, but it was always with a clear goal and purpose that they put themselves in the act of civil disobedience.I will be spending my upcoming months going through the readings, books, and independent research to learn more about the civil rights movements and its leaders. I was not taught any of this in detail in highschool, which I feel that it should!!! This course is timely, and much needed, as it's been disparaging to try to remain engaged and active under Trumplandia. Thank you to those who lived this history. Thank you SO MUCH for translating your experiences into another digestible course, so that less informed folks like me can encounter (albeit late) your bravery, intelligence, and accomplishments which should never be forgotten.",5

"Very nice course. It was a privilege to learn the subject from one of the best teams in the world.

"I think this course is the best entry into the concepts of ML you can find. Andrew Ng is a wonderful, passionate teacher and explains most concepts in a way that is easy to grasp. I liked the emphasis on supervised learning and taking time to explain the very foundation with linear regression, logistic regression in great detail. When you look around the internet everyone is talking about cNN, Deep Learning, GANs, ... but the truth is - you first need to get your foundation right before moving on the more advanced topics. ML is actually a lot of mathematics, stochastic - so getting initial knowledge about these topics is important. Some things in the course where not that well explained, for example Back Propagation. In general I can recommend this course to anyone who wants to START with Machine Learning and needs some orientation on the subject.",5

Great course. I learned a lot.Too bad they still say they're verifying my assignments... no certificate so far.. :(,5
"Very helpful course in understanding basics of software engineering, but more so an insight into what programming is really like. I thought it would take long, but it didn't really. You get to the point where you want it to be good or you want it to be satisfactory - if you choose good then you'll be spending more time on it without realising. Good course, friendly and honest reviewers. Thanks everyone.",5

It is a course which offers practical knowledge. Provides a very good insight on the branding world.,5
"This introductory course is perfect. It gives you time to think (you don't have to spend too much time in order to understand the material/concepts) and it is self-sufficient. I would suggest to set the playback rate at 1.25 since the teacher talks really slow. In addition, I would like to see the teacher talking like a human being instead of reading his notes in a black background but this is not super important for me. All in all, I totally recommend it!",5

Excellent course! I find this Fundamentals of Graphic Design very useful for everyone not just designer. It does not only provide me with very basic yet very useful knowledge of graphic design but also helped me greatly in practicing certain skills that I never thought I would have. The assignments and all peer-review sessions are quite challenging too though the video sessions with the teachers always sound very easy to understand. I love this challenge anyway. Strongly recommended.,5

"A superb course taught by a superb lecturer. From a lecture stanpoint, my only recommendation is that additional lectures be provided to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. I found the assignments challenging and a good reflection on my understanding of the course material. I would recommend only the following tweaks:Week 1 assignment: Either tightly specify the function that determines if a particular String is present in a large textstring OR provide the function in the assignment skeleton. There are too many ways to approach this function that are correct, but different than the one the grader used. This function is only incidental to the goal of applying one's knowledge of Spark to the assignment.Week 4: Allocate additional lectures to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. The subject was not covered to the same level of detail that the other subjects in the course were given.These are minor points.Well done, Dr Heather Miller!",5
"I am almost at the end of this course and I think it is excellent. The lectures are very clear and are a great starting point if you, like me, don't really know anything about Buddhism. I really enjoyed the connection made with modern psychology; I am afraid otherwise I might have found it too vague and esoteric, but this grounded it more in every day life. I really feel this course has given me some valuable new insights with which to see the world around me and myself.",5
"This was a wonderful course, I would definitely take this again.",5
So far the best course on the topic.,5

"An extremely thorough treatment of the initial stages of the Project Management process, which in many cases is the most important! Thoroughly enjoyed it.Would recommend it to everyone!",5
good course for beginners and the instructor teaching simply way talent,5
If you want to make a career out of ML or simply understand what everybody is talking about this is an amazing course.

"The course is very interesting and very challenging,As an firmware engineer who never had the chance to learn Crypto. the course gave me a grate introduction to this field.It is very fascinating to understand the different Crypto. methods and their vulnerabilities, and it made me more aware and gave me the ability to evaluate strength of Crypto. systems that I encounter.Before every topic there were a detailed overview on the Math theory required to learn it, the explanations followed by real life examples and it feels like the team put a lot of effort to make the lectures comfortable and easy to follow.The Homework are challenging and very help-hull to understand the learned topics.",5
"A really good introduction to the course, well explained, good videos, I only wish I could have read the extra materials too. Only one complaint (very minor) - I live in Colombia and found a couple of references to Columbia in the materials. But overall super.",5

good course with great stuff,5
High quality course with professional and friendly instructors.,5
"Excellent course. I signed up for this course only because of curiosity, after week 1, my interest grew, I had no idea about how the memory ""works"" (or doesn't), I binged on watching lectures for all weeks and passed weekly quizzes in 1st attempt (except week 1 where I needed 2 attempts), I'm so glad I pursued this and finished in 2 days' time. The subject content, intermixed with relevant movies, flow of the topics, depth and breadth, the way prof. Seamon explains (narrative, style) - all is very good. I'd certainly recommend this course to other students. And, I'll look forward to reading Prof.'s book to understand the topic a bit more. Thanks to all (Coursera, Weslyan U, staff).",5

"I used to always say that everyone in life no matter what their profession was, should take at least one basic psychology course in their lives. After taking this course I can now say that this course is another one on the list for everyone in life to take --it should be a requirement. I feel very fortunate to have stumbles upon it, and I´m very happy that I took it! And just by taking the course my life has already started to change, because I am now aware of things to make myself happier that I was not aware of before, so this course has shed a lot of light on life, human beings and how to be happier. Last, I´m very grateful to Prof. Rajagopal Raghunathan, for coming up with the great idea of giving this course! And wish him all the best with his new book! Thank you all!",5

I'm new to HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the course just enlighten me a lot. I had the opportunity to understand a HTML, CSS and JavaScript file, and I know that now I can write a web page and a web application. Now it's a matter of time and dedication by my part. I also realize that my knowledge of Java still applies with JS. I really enjoyed our field trip to Baltimore. Thanks, Prof. Chaikin, for going with us and for sharing, more than the course itself, part of your being. I can tell you are an excellent person. I had lots of knowledge and fun. Thanks again, Prof. Chaikin. I was very nice to meet you...I Also want to thank Coursera and Johns Hopkins University for made it possible for the course to be in my laptop near the countryside in Colombia. Thank you!",5
"Logically organised, informative and enjoyable. This was an excellent introductory course to Urban Education Issues and provided me with a solid starting point for exploring the subject.",5
I already tried different courses on Python and they all were not really good or were tending in a direction that is not interesting for me. In this course it is not like that: I found it to be very informing and well structured. I learned a lot and will keep on learning Python!,5
I will recommend everyone to spend some quality time with Dr. Raj to discover happiness inside you.,5
This course is an amazing introduction not only to Python but coding and how computers work in general. The videos are super helpful and the professor is very funny and a great lecturer.,5
"Very useful for all the users, who are not still working in the transplantation field: for those people this course is perhaps too superficial.",5
Very nice course,5
It is a very good course for beginnners . I have proramming experinece but i wanted to learn python and this was the right choice.,5

It is an excellent course for parents and teachers who support dyslexic children!,5
Awesome course,5

Iit is packed full with (new) insights, very entertaining with excellent quality images, comments from the various lecturers that will make you think in a more balanced way about the world we live in.I did not know about Big History and signed up out of curiosity. However, I believe it should be mandatory for everybody to get this kind of connection of various disciplines to understand more of what got us here.Strongly recommended!",5

Good course for begineer,5
Great course!,5
Simple and useful,5
I have learnt a lot from this course. I thought negotiation should be a natural thing for you to know if you are in business or deal with people but now I have come to know that it is more than 'dragging' who will win/lose. But now I know better. Thank you very much for the knowledge gained.,5
"Thought the course does not start very strong, it evolves into a very interesting place of compact knowledge for both the fashion and the luxury industry.For a professional, like myself, who already has a master's degree in the field of luxury and works within the industry, it is a great way to get remind of the theories and the knowledge behind the management, the how and the why luxury does things in its own unique way.It would be even better to add knowledge into more ""exclusive"" categories like cars or yachts. Yet, the structure of the course, the delivery, the case studies and the overall performance keep the attendee's attention. Personally, I started the course a bit hesitant, but managed to finish it within only a week because of the flow and quality of information.",5
Gives you the basics what you need to develop your skills further! Good one!,5
"The whole specialization series is definitely a 5 star Coursera course. As a electrical engineer designing lab and industrial use power supplies, I found the material in this class review and enhance my knowledge, and more importantly, a systematic view of DC-DC converter concepts, which is a good reference of my future career.The book those professors wrote is called ""bible"" in the power electronic industry, and most of the interviewers will ask questions related to the material in that book when you take a job interview in this industry, especially for an entry level or junior position. Watching the videos and doing the homework and final project help me understand those material more efficiently.I appreciate the great work from all three professors!",5
Eye-opening and truly inspiring course with lots of solutions for anyone who is a team leader.,5
basic but cool!,5
this might change the way you live.,5
Part B of a 3 part course. One of the best i have taken up on Coursera,5
Meticulously designed for crisp understanding!,5
This course has changed many things in my life. The way I approach learning as well as teaching has improved enormously. It is one of the great things that happened to me this year.,5
"short and sweet and right down to the point, this course offers very basic techniques for being efficient in the workplace. nothing revolutionary, but very basic stuff that truly works. It does not take much time and effort to go through the course and immediately apply what you learn.I have been in the professional life for 4 decades now, but I still learned a few tricks that helped me get more transparency in how I spend my time.highly recommended.",5
"It was the best course I have ever come across about universe. The course is divided into four lectures of increasing complexity. It begins with every day phenomena like day and nights, seasons and takes you to solar system, galaxies, stars, particle accelerators, Higgs boson, dark matter, dark energy to big bang and inflation theory.I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious to know about origin and possible fate of our universe.",5
"Well paced and explained, also relatively useful tuition in life, highlights rather extensively on the subject.",5

Great and extremely helpful MOOC. Thank you!,5
"This was a great course for expanding the way I thought about making, communicating with, and looking at graphic images.At times I was frustrated because I did not know how to easily do certain things with the programs I was using, but I reminded myself that this was not a class on how to use Photoshop or Illustrator. If you are looking to learn about actually using programs, look elsewhere, but if you are looking to build a strong basis for thinking about creating images, this is a great resource.The course work and necessary time input is flexible - if you are stretched for time you can still complete this course, and if you have a lot of time you can get a lot more out of it. Either way, a lot of the learning from this work is dependent on how much effort you put it.",5
"Help me a lot, thanks!",5
This course is very important,5
"I cannot believe how much I have learned in this course. I went to knowing zero about web development to being able to style a whole page. Colleen is such a good instructor and the homework was pretty difficult, but very rewarding! Definitely a good class for beginners like me. I have taken classes through springboard, and i did not feel like they were as organized as this one.",5
Thank you for the great course! It was very beneficial to me,5

Thoroughly engaging presentation of a topic that was very much esoteric to me previously. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for insight into portfolio and risk management.,5
"strong 5 stars. There are some minor issues and concerns, BUT even the sun has spots. Two great things about this course. First, it's very structured overview of how organizations are designed and managed, HR policies, culture, decision making, also it reiterates Northcraft's courses pretty well. Second, is brilliant reading assignments. I would never found and read those articles. They've been SO useful. I definitely recommend this course, although I was a bit skeptical about the first part.",5
"Excellent course! Very well thought out and introduced step by step. I'm on the third course in the series. This lays a great foundation. The assignments are great at taking previous exercise code and tailoring to new forms. It take a little extra effort and research, but will make you a better programmer.",5

Great course. I've learned a lot. And also good to understand to foreigners. :D,5
"Self contained, hard to find hands-on course ,that offers accessible exercises that are progressively difficult (ie: without dramatic jumps), Do not use this as a comprehensive Python training, rather a very good place to practice what ""you think"" you have learned...",5
strongly recommended!,5
Best course to learn the basics of accessing web data and professor chuck is lovable as ever!!,5
Excellent course. A great hands-on introduction to game development!,5
Very helpful!,5
Charles Severance is perhaps the greatest instructor of a programming language that I have ever encountered. Not only are the lectures engaging but the assignments are relevant and I have been able to apply what I have learned immediately to my day to day life.,5

Great Course,5
Great. Thank you so much.,5
It is an excellent course I recommend a lot.,5
"I am a philology major student, and I can say that this course made me fall in love with mathematics from the very first lesson. It is easy to follow, the explanations are very clear, and the tests are doable even for those who have not solved a single maths problem in years (in this case one will probably need to refresh some basic things, but it will not take long, because many of the school basics are also explained in the beginning of the course). Thank you, Professor Fowler, for these wonderful 16 weeks of Calculus 1!",5
so helpful.,5
Thank you for teach me basic Korean^^,5
Great introduction to the PMI system and a great foundation for the coursework to come.,5

"Very practical and applied, great teaching style, and fun.",5
"very fun course to learn, a slightly advanced level course after this(doesn't matter included in this specialization or not) will be great!",5
"I would definitely recommend this course! I was very impressed by the quality of the lectures. Professor Ng uses the medium very well. He's easy to follow and the content is solid.The assignments were also good. They provide a ton of scaffolding, so you rarely have to write a lot of code, but if you never used Matlab before (like me) and it's been awhile since you've taken linear algebra (also true for me), then ""thinking in terms of vectorization"" takes a bit of getting used to. I'm really happy that I've been exposed to it, though, and it's pretty impressive how much computation you can express in one or two lines of Matlab.I only had to use the forums once at the beginning to figure out why I couldn't submit assignments. (It turned out that my version of Octave was too new for what the assignments had been tested with.) Once I got that sorted out, I never had to go back there for help, which I thought was a good sign that the assignments were clear and had been through sufficient testing by the staff.It's certainly a bit of a time commitment. I would probably budget at least 5 hours per week. I took a lot of notes, so I paused/rewound the videos a bunch, so it took longer for me to ""watch"" the videos than the advertised time.Again, the assignments were often not that much code, and I think they started to take me less time as I progressed through the course as I got more familiar with Octave and the style of the assignments. They aren't there to trick you or separate the wheat from the chaff: they're really there to reinforce the concepts from lecture and have you write some code yourself so you have some chance of writing your own code for your own project machine learning project one day.If anything, the assignments provide much more help than I expected. That is, if this were an in-person course where I could go to office hours or whatever if I got stuck, I would expect the assignments to provide less scaffolding and to force you to struggle quite a bit on your own more. (Maybe I just have bad flashbacks to undergrad or something.)",5
"Really helpful for the beginners and professionals , Instructor is really knows what he is teaching and is really professional. I recommend this course to all the people looking for guidelines regarding Project Management.",5
"A beautiful combining of statistical data from psychological studies, simple examples to try in our own lives and a hammering home of the idea that ""Happiness"" is a concrete and desirable state of mind that people may want to prioritze and work at to achieve that elusive something that life hasn't ""accidentally"" had them stumble into.",5
It was very intersting course and so useful for me!,5
Very useful course. It could change your life .... and even your future!,5

Wonderful course I haven't realized the power of influence before taken this course! Thank You Coursera!,5
"Exceptional course! Lectures were engaging, informative, and insightful. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who might be thinking about providing assistance in a crisis situation. Furthermore, there are skills taught in this course that prove not only useful in crisis situations but in everyday life as well. Needless to say I am excited to practice what I have learned from this course into any and all situations I may be involved in!",5
"Very helpful for me, but I found difficult to do the test that not the native English speaker.",5
"Excellent, succinct and applicable insights on Data Science for the uninitiated and the experienced alike.",5
Great course!,5
"This is a great course that you can apply to a broad number of things. From learning a new hobby, to acing an exam. I've been slowly applying what I've learned even during taking the course. I know understand my brain better, and see the cues of procrastination and have been better at avoiding them—but still fall into the trap. I feel like a much more functional human being just from taking this course, and have already gotten over a work slump that I having trouble with (a difficult project that I've been putting off was completed by doing the Pomodoro Method.)",5
Very enjoyable course. It wet my appetite and I'm ready for the following courses.,5
"The lecturer uses different scenarios, interviews many other professors and makes the subject practical. I recommend it.",5
Scott Persons really presents this course to make it interesting. Very nice.,5
"Course provided me great insight regarding different dimension of development and what is the appropriate definition of 'development'. The least developed countries of today will achieve the status of 'most developed countries' however, the cost that environment has paid for the present 'most developed countries' need to be taken care of with a balanced approach. The shackles of poverty can only be removed by social inclusion and creating good public policy. This course has added a new perspective about sustainable development.",5
Very helpful tips....wish I did this course 30 years ago!!,5
"There are so many things I was doing wrong or without understanding what was going on until I took this class.The teacher is the best I ever had, she makes me want to learn more, practice more, make mistakes.I can't express how thankful I am with the opportunity of learning from the basics!!!Thank you so much!!!!",5
"great course, very intersting introduction of photography ~",5
I recommend it to everyone.,5
"Great, thank you very much for this course.",5
I am really enjoying this course. It has a different approach with deep analysis and a very interesting bibliography. It focuses on what really matters and not only trying to understand the Muslim World only through religion or international relations.,5
Great...,5
I loved studying Machine Learning on COUSERA taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. I found the material to be very challenging to learn and I learned a lot during the course. I look forward to applying the techniques I have learned to real world applications.,5
"Excellent short videos, with useful tutorials on youtube to get back to. I think it iwas a good way to learn illustrator and infographics.The instructor is very knowledgable and experienced with visuals and graphic design, so it;s good to listen to his ideas.The assignments take quite a bit of time for newbies to illustrator like me.",5
The best course I have ever done online.... Big thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng. I now lecture Machine learning and Neural Networks in a Federal University in Nigeria. It all started with this course.,5
"Well organized course. Refined down to details. Gradual introduction of topics, good test-case, the skill of the Professor is excellent.",5
Very useful who wants to start or wants to revise.,5
Great introductionIt is a great introduction course to this fascinating field. Explanations are very clear (supposing you have previous knowledge about molecular biology) and provided further reading links are very good if you look for deeper knowledge. I strongly recommend this course to biologstudents who did not have the opportunity to go into detail about epigenetics.,5
"Woow! I had taken a course on Strength of Materials before, for my undergrad, but decided to take this course as refresher and to grasp some missed concepts. Dr. Whiteman's approach to teaching the course really helped me a lot to understand the behavior of materials in both the linear elastic and plastic regions. Mohr's Circles was a mystery for me, for some strange reason, but Dr. Whiteman really opened the door for me in this course. Overall, I think it was time well spent, and I will definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to have a solid grasp of the fundamental principles of mechanics of materials.",5
It's free and would serve many to be passed through at least 10-20 mins per few days. Good info.,5
"I really enjoyed the lessons that related to various parts of the Wizard of Oz....made the class meaningful and ""sticky"". Well done!",5
"Best full stack courses, you can even understand how Angular works better",5
I've learned a lot from this. Thanks coursera.org and John Hopkins University.,5

Awesome course for those wanting to learn the basics of Python.,5
"Great Course - just one of the elements, the interview with the gentleman from Loews Innovation Labs was pretty lame. I don't think he had much content to share, and he sounded as if he's arrived in life!",5
"Well done, I learned a lot from this course.",5
"Dr. Chuck is the most encouraging and entertaining teacher I have ever met!!! He really makes learning about computer and programming easy and fun! I really enjoyed his lectures and I cannot believe learning programming can be such a pleasure!Most importantly, Dr. Chuck intentionally included many mistakes in his teaching materials. As a self-taught programmer who has struggled on one's own, I believe this is the most valuable part of the lectures. The students get to understand from the very beginning how to read error messages and tracebacks, how to debug, how not to be intimidated by mistakes and failures, and how to become a confident programmer. This should be THE teaching model for programming in any language!Thank you, Dr. Chuck! And I look forward to learning more from you in our follow-up courses!",5
I really enjoyed taking this course. Especially the interviews with business leaders were helpful for me because it showed me how strategies and practices were applied in the business world.,5
"So far this course is given at a pace that is just perfect. The instructors explain concepts in ways that make the subject matter easy to learn, particularly for someone who loves data, but is terrified of heavy mathematical concepts. I've taken similar courses at local community colleges where class size is much smaller, and have been very disappointed. So f",5
Great course!!! I learned a lot!!!,5
"Thanks a lot Maya, I am cooking your recipes and my famly love them. I adjust them to ingredients in my country, I from Peru. The knowledge is great to complement my work. I am a doctor, i got a certified speciality from ACSM, so the course is important for my family and my patients. Greetings.",5
"Straightforward, very well executed. I love this course!",5
"Great course with a great instructor. The course was aimed at general pubic interested in Breast Cancer, so the it is structured to be very easily followed. While I was looking for a more challenging course, the course does a great job as an introductory course.",5
Great instructor with useful contests.,5
Exceptional technique of teaching. Keeps you gripped and interested in it.,5
"More effort we put in, more we get... Awesome course!",5
I really liked the case study approach. It starts from real life examples and shows you how simple it is to make your own models and predictions which really lures you into the machine learning concept.,5
"Great Course, strongly recommend!",5
This is a great class to understand Beethoven. Thanks.,5
Perfect course for Machine Learning 101,5
Good lecture and assignment. Let me learn a lot of things.,5
"Very well paced, adn clearly explained. Transcripts are good though note you'll need to annotate them with the equations discussed.",5
"I think the course offers a very concise and helpful foundation for the knowledge of the oil and gas industry. The teaching method and platform was something I appreciated most, because of its flexibility and, in the meantime, its discipline in terms of fundamentals of the domain. While progreesing with the course readings, I was happy to see I was able to maintain a good level of conversation with professionals from the oil and gas industry. Gook luck, to all of you!",5
Excellent course and teacher. Congratulations!!,5
This course helped me to lot to manage my time,5
